## Introduction

We'll begin today with a short introduction/overview of the work you'll do in class today.

## Getting Ready

Today, you'll need the following:

1. Your laptop.

1. The tool cart (in particular, a small toolbox).

1. Parts Kit #3.

## Circuit 1: The Arcade Button (Pull-Up)

## Circuit 2: The Arcade Button (Pull-Down)

## Circuit 3: The Arcade Button (Direct)

### Notes

I need to think about the kind of feedback that they will receive. For example, if this is the first time they do this kind of work, I might want to provide formative feedback that tells them what to do in the next chunk. 

{% include rimg src="scaffolding.png" %}

For example, if this is a first time they do these diagrams (it might not be, but play pretend), then I might provide formative feedback that clearly communicates that they are performing at a C or D level. However, I wouldn't want to use letter grades, but I do want to provide some kind of clear indicator that they're on a bad trajectory.

{% include rimg src="visual-feedback.png" %}

Something like the above (as a first sketch...) that they can use to see that they are improving on each piece of a stacked exercise. They might be limited to two revisions, and after each revision, I provide 1-2 points of feedback that they can use to improve their work. In drastic cases, it's "see me." In less drastic cases, it's one or two points that they can work on (perhaps with the writing center) to refine their writing and work. This way, as we introduce each new piece, they see how the only "graded" piece is the final document, but they've received clear feedback all along the way... and, they can see the feedback they received.

I think I want something visual because of the forward direction it implies... a single "grade" is static. Arrows imply motion.
