<h4>To Do</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Read two articles that I have suggested.</li>
  <li>Find an interesting article to share online.</li>
  <li>Blog about your article and your personal sleep habits.</li>
</ul>

<b>Expected Work Time</b>: 1h 30m
{% endcallout %}

## Reading: Sleep Hacks (15m)

First, we'll start with a "popular article" (a *blog post*) regarding ways to sleep better, wake up better, or even stay awake better.
 
## Reading: Sleep Janitors (45m)

{% callout danger %}
<h4>FIXME</h4>
I need to create a video for this section. In particular, how to read/take notes on a complex paper.
{% endcallout %}


The second article will take you longer to read. It is a scientific article, and you're going to need to take notes as you read.

First, start with this video, which provides a summary of the work.

<div class="text-center">
  <iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/96aZtk4hVJM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

Then, as you read, take notes. For now, note those things you understand, and those things that you don't.

## Blog: Sleep Habits (30m)

Finally, when you're done, I'd like you to blog about two things.

**First**, blog about your article. In particular, give us a link to the article, and a short (2-3 sentence) summary of the article and what you learned from it.

**Second**, write a bit about your own personal experience with sleep. You don't have to answer the following questions, but they might help get you thinking about what you want to write.

* What is the act of sleeping like for you? What has changed (if anything) in your sleep habits since coming to Berea? 
* What things can you anticipate changing in the future? 
* Given your reading, are there any strategies you think you might take to better control your sleep habits so that you can be healthier and more effective in your work as a full-time student at Berea?

Again, when it comes to these three motivating questions, **they are just suggestions**. Your blog is your own, and my only request is that this points us at an interesting article (and summarizes it), and the rest of your post is a personal reflection regarding your relationship with sleep, be it past, present, or future.

## Submission

When you're done, share a link to your blog post. You can submit it below, [or visit the full form here][form].

## Feedback

The feedback you receive will focus on the quality and depth of your reflections that appear in your blog post.

  <div class="col-md-8">
    As we read about sleep and how it is studied, we begin to see why it is so important for each of us to get healthy amounts of sleep on a regular basis.

<div class="row">

    {% fink Question A HD C LL %}
