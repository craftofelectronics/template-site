<p>A feature found on most 7-segment decoder/driver ICs is called <em>ripple blanking</em>. Describe what this feature is, and why it is used. Hint: a good source of information on this subject is a datasheet for a 7-segment decoder/driver IC.</p>
<p>&quot;Ripple blanking&quot; is used in multi-digit displays to force leading or trailing zeroes to the off state.</p>
<p>The answer I give here is purposefully vague, as usual. What I want students to do is research datasheets on their own and be able to show where they got their information.</p>
