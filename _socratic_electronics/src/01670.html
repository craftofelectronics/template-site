<p>Plot the magnetic flux (<span class="math">Φ </span>) over time in the core of an ideal transformer, given a square-wave voltage applied to the primary winding:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01670x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Important: note the point in time where the square-wave source is energized. The first pulse of applied voltage to the primary winding is not full-duration!</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01670x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Follow-up question: explain why the flux waveform is symmetrical about the zero line (perfectly balanced between positive and negative half-cycles) in this particular scenario. How would this situation differ if the square-wave voltage source were energized at a slightly different point in time?</p>
<p>Have students relate the equation <span class="math">$E_{L} = N {d \phi \over dt}$</span> to this problem, discussing the flux wave-shape in terms of rate-of-change over time.</p>
