<p>Identify each type of MOSFET (whether it is N-channel or P-channel, D-type or E-type), label the terminals, and determine whether the MOSFET in each of these circuits will be turned <em>on</em> or <em>off</em>:</p>

<p>Follow-up question: which of these transistors is <em>depleted</em> and which is <em>enhanced</em>?</p>
<p>It is very important for your students to understand what factor(s) in a circuit force a MOSFET to turn on or off. Some of the information contained in the diagrams is relevant to the determination of each transistor’s status, and some is not.</p>
<p>Be sure to ask your students to explain their reasoning for each transistor’s status. What factor, or combination of factors, is necessary to turn a MOSFET on, versus off?</p>
