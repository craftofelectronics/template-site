<p><em>Factoring</em> is a powerful simplification technique in Boolean algebra, just as it is in real-number algebra. Show how you can use factoring to help simplify the following Boolean expressions:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math"><em>C</em> + <em>C</em><em>D</em></span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$A\overline{B}C +  A\overline{B} \&gt; \overline{C}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$XY\overline{Z} + XYZ + XYW$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\overline{D}EF + AB + \overline{D}E + 0 + ABC$</span><br /></p>
<p>You will be expected to show your work (including all factoring) in your answers!</p>
<p><br /><span class="math"><em>C</em> + <em>C</em><em>D</em> = <em>C</em></span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$A\overline{B}C +  A\overline{B} \&gt; \overline{C} = A\overline{B}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$XY\overline{Z} + XYZ + XYW = XY$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\overline{D}EF + AB + \overline{D}E + 0 + ABC = AB + \overline{D}E$</span><br /></p>
<p>For some reason, many of my students (who enter my course weak in algebra skills) generally seem to have a lot of trouble with factoring, be it Boolean algebra or regular algebra. This is unfortunate, as factoring is a powerful analytical tool. The &quot;trick,&quot; if there is any such thing, is recognizing common variables in different product terms, and identifying which of them should be factored out to reduce the expression most efficiently.</p>
<p>Like all challenging things, factoring takes time and practice to learn. There are no shortcuts, really.</p>
