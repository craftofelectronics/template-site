<p>Identify the type of oscillator circuit shown in this schematic diagram, and explain the purpose of the crystal:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01083x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Challenge question: this type of oscillator circuit is usually limited to lower power outputs than either Hartley or Colpitts designs. Explain why.</p>
<p>This is a <em>Pierce</em> oscillator circuit, and the crystal plays the same role that a tank circuit would in a Hartley or Colpitts oscillator.</p>
<p>Ask your students to explain how the oscillator circuitâ€™s natural frequency may be altered. How does this differ from frequency control in either the Hartley or Colpitts designs?</p>
