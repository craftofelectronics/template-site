<p>Use circuit simulation software to verify your predicted and measured parameter values.</p>
<p>Use a variable-voltage, regulated power supply to supply any amount of DC voltage below 30 volts. Have students calculate the necessary current-limiting resistor for their LEDs based on measured values of <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>f</em><em>o</em><em>r</em><em>w</em><em>a</em><em>r</em><em>d</em></sub></span> for the LED (using a multimeter with a &quot;diode-check&quot; function). Let students research the typical forward current for their LED from an appropriate datasheet. Any LED should suffice for this activity.</p>
<p>An extension of this exercise is to incorporate troubleshooting questions. Whether using this exercise as a performance assessment or simply as a concept-building lab, you might want to follow up your studentsâ€™ results by asking them to predict the consequences of certain circuit faults.</p>
