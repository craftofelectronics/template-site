<p>In the early days of electrical wiring, wires used to be insulated with <em>cotton</em>. This is no longer accepted practice. Explain why.</p>
<p>Cotton, like many natural fibers, is an electrical insulator . . . until it becomes wet!</p>
<p>This question affords the opportunity to discuss electrical safety with regard to clothing (often made of cotton). Does dry clothing offer insulation to electricity like the old-style cotton wire insulation? Can cotton clothing be trusted to insulate you safely from hazardous voltage?</p>
