<p>The <em>Fourier series</em> is much more than a mathematical abstraction. The mathematical equivalence between any periodic waveform and a series of sinusoidal waveforms can be a powerful analytical tool for the electronic engineer and technician alike.</p>
<p>Explain how knowing the Fourier series for a particular non-sinusoidal waveform simplifies the analysis of an AC circuit. For example, how would our knowledge of a square waveâ€™s Fourier series help in the analysis of this circuit?</p>

<p>The circuit could be analyzed one harmonic at a time, the results combined via the <em>Superposition Theorem</em>:</p>

<p>At first, some students have trouble understanding exactly how Fourier analysis is helpful in any practical way as an analytical tool. The purpose of this question is to have them see how it might be applied to something they are familiar with: an LR circuit.</p>
