<p>A spool holds an unknown length of aluminum wire. The size of the wire is 4 AWG. Fortunately, both ends of the wire are available for contact with an ohmmeter, to measure the resistance of the entire spool. When measured, the wire’s total resistance is 0.135 <span class="math">Ω </span>. How much wire is on the spool (assuming the spool is at room temperature)?</p>
<p>353.51 feet</p>
<p>This question illustrates another practical application of specific resistance calculations: how to determine the length of wire on a spool. The amount of resistance in this example is quite low, being a mere fraction of an ohm. Ask your students what kinds of problems they might encounter trying to measure such a low resistance with accuracy. Would the typical errors incurred in such a low-resistance measurement tend to make their calculation of length be excessive, or too low? Why?</p>
