<p>How much electrical power is being dissipated by the light bulb in this circuit?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00178x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>In this circuit, identify which component is the <em>source</em> and which is the <em>load</em>.</p>
<p>6.48 watts</p>
<p>Here, the battery is the source and the light bulb is the load.</p>
<p>The solution to this problem simply requires the application of Ohmâ€™s Law. As for the question of source versus load, ask your students to define each of these words in terms of energy transfer.</p>
