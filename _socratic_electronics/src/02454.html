<p>A common set of equations for calculating input and output impedances of bypassed common-emitter amplifier circuits is as follows:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math"><em>Z</em><sub><em>i</em><em>n</em></sub> ≈ <em>R</em><sub>1</sub> ∣∣ <em>R</em><sub>2</sub> ∣∣ (<em>β</em> + 1)<em>r</em>ʹ<sub><em>e</em></sub></span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math"><em>Z</em><sub><em>o</em><em>u</em><em>t</em></sub> ≈ <em>R</em><sub><em>C</em></sub></span><br /></p>
<p>If precision is not required, we may greatly simplify the first equation by assuming the transistor to be ideal; i.e. having an infinite current gain (<span class="math"><em>β</em> = ∞</span>). Re-write the first equation accordingly, and explain how you simplified it.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math"><em>Z</em><sub><em>i</em><em>n</em></sub> ≈ <em>R</em><sub>1</sub> ∣∣ <em>R</em><sub>2</sub> </span><br /></p>
<p>Follow-up question: how does the similar simplification of the &quot;swamped&quot; common-emitter amplifier’s input impedance equation compare?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$Z_{in} \approx R_1 \&gt; || \&gt; R_2 \&gt; || \&gt; (\beta + 1)(r'_e + R_E) \hbox{\hskip 20pt Assuming a finite-beta transistor}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The purpose of this question is for students to see how (more) approximate predictions for circuits may be obtained through simplification. A good exercise is to calculate impedances for a given amplifier circuit using both the original and the simplified equations, to see just how &quot;approximate&quot; the simplified answers are. Knowing how to eliminate complicated terms in equations (and what terms may be safely eliminated!) is key to estimating in the absence of a calculator.</p>
