<p>The following schematic is of a relay circuit that emulates a standard digital logic gate function:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01289x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Write a truth table for this circuitâ€™s function, and determine what name best represents it (AND, OR, NAND, NOR, or NOT).</p>
<p>This is an OR function.</p>
<p>Ask your students to identify what arrangement the relay contacts are connected it: series or parallel? Does this contact arrangement make sense with regard to the established function of the gate?</p>
