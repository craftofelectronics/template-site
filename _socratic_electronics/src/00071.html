<p>What is happening when two objects are rubbed together and static electricity results?</p>
<p>When certain combinations of materials are rubbed together, the rubbing action transfer electrons from the atoms of one material to the atoms of the other. This imbalance of electrons leaves the former material with a <em>positive</em> charge and the latter with a <em>negative</em> charge.</p>
<p>The terms &quot;positive&quot; and &quot;negative&quot; seem backward in relation to the modern concept of electrons as charge carriers. Be sure to discuss the historical aspect of this terminology (Benjamin Franklin’s conjecture), and the subsequent designation of an electron’s individual charge as &quot;negative.&quot;</p>
