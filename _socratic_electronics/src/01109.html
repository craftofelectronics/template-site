<p>Design a clipper circuit that eliminates the positive portion of this AC waveform, leaving only the negative half-cycles to appear on the output:</p>

<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01109x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Note: the circuit shown here is not the only possible solution!</p>
<p>Follow-up question: the output waveform shown for this circuit is true only for an <em>ideal</em> diode, not a real diode. Explain what the output waveform would look like if a real diode were used, and recommend a diode model that closely approximates the ideal case for this application.</p>
<p>A good review of basic diode concepts here. Students should recognize the output waveform as being indicative of half-wave rectification, which may cause them to think of other circuit designs.</p>
