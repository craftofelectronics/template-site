<p>A <em>series</em> is a very important concept in mathematics. The common notation for a &quot;series&quot; looks something like this (a type of &quot;geometric&quot; series is shown here as an example):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">∑ <sub><em>n</em> = 0</sub><sup>∞</sup><em>x</em><sup><em>n</em></sup></span><br /></p>
<p>Explain what this notation means, and how we may approximate the value of a series for a finite value of <span class="math"><em>n</em></span>.</p>
<p>A &quot;series&quot; is comprised of a set of terms added together, each term related to the others by a common form, distinguished only by the incrementing or decrementing of a common variable. To illustrate by example, here is an expansion of the geometric series shown in the question:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">∑ <sub><em>n</em> = 0</sub><sup>∞</sup><em>x</em><sup><em>n</em></sup> = <em>x</em><sup>0</sup> + <em>x</em><sup>1</sup> + <em>x</em><sup>2</sup> + <em>x</em><sup>3</sup> + <em>x</em><sup>4</sup> + ⋯ + <em>x</em><sup>∞</sup></span><br /></p>
<p>Follow-up question: what do you think the value of this series would be if the value of <span class="math"><em>x</em></span> was greater than (positive) 1? What if <span class="math"><em>x</em> = 0</span>? What if <span class="math">0 &lt; <em>x</em> &lt; 1</span>?</p>
<p>The purpose of this question is to familiarize students with the concept of a mathematical series, and the notation used to describe series.</p>
