<p>Identify each of these filter types, and explain <em>how</em> you were able to positively identify their behaviors:</p>

<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02098x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Follow-up question: in each of the circuits shown, identify at least one <em>single</em> component failure that has the ability to prevent any signal voltage from reaching the output terminals.</p>
<p>Some of these filter designs are resonant in nature, while others are not. Resonant circuits, especially when made with high-Q components, approach ideal band-pass (or -block) characteristics. Discuss with your students the different design strategies between resonant and non-resonant band filters.</p>
<p>The high-pass filter containing both inductors and capacitors may at first appear to be some form of resonant (i.e. band-pass or band-stop) filter. It actually <em>will</em> resonate at some frequency(ies), but its overall behavior is still high-pass. If students ask about this, you may best answer their queries by using computer simulation software to plot the behavior of a similar circuit (or by suggesting they do the simulation themselves).</p>
<p>Regarding the follow-up question, it would be a good exercise to discuss which suggested component failures are more likely than others, given the relatively likelihood for capacitors to fail shorted and inductors and resistors to fail open.</p>
