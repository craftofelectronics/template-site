<p>Use circuit simulation software to verify your predicted and measured parameter values.</p>
<p>Here, students must choose the right type of series RC circuit configuration to provide the requested phase shift. This, of course, also involves choosing proper values for <span class="math"><em>C</em><sub>1</sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span>, and being able to successfully measure phase shift with an oscilloscope.</p>
<p>I recommend selecting a phase shift angle (<span class="math">Θ </span>) somewhere between 15<span class="math">$^{o}$</span> and 75<span class="math">$^{o}$</span>. Angles too close to 90<span class="math">$^{o}$</span> will result in small output voltages that are difficult to measure through the noise.</p>
<p>An extension of this exercise is to incorporate troubleshooting questions. Whether using this exercise as a performance assessment or simply as a concept-building lab, you might want to follow up your students’ results by asking them to predict the consequences of certain circuit faults.</p>
