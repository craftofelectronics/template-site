<p>This circuit uses a combination of capacitance and resistance to produce a time delay when the pushbutton switch is released, causing the lamp to remain on for a short while after the switch opens:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03721x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Calculate how long the lamp will remain on after the switch opens, assuming the MOSFET has a gate threshold (turn-on) voltage of <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>G</em><em>S</em>(<em>t</em><em>h</em>)</sub></span> = 4 volts.</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>t</em><sub><em>d</em><em>e</em><em>l</em><em>a</em><em>y</em></sub></span> = 2.05 seconds</p>
<p>In order to solve this problem, students must apply their knowledge of capacitive discharge circuits to find the correct equation for time. Ask them how they set up the solution, and how they knew what equation(s) to use.</p>
