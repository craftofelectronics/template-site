<p>What purpose does the TRIAC serve in this circuit?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02145x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Why use a TRIAC at all? Why not just use the switch to directly handle load current as in this next circuit?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02145x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The difference between these two circuits is a matter of switch currents. If you understand how a TRIAC works, the answer to this question should not be too difficult to figure out on your own.</p>
<p>A benefit of this circuit that is easy to miss is the TRIACâ€™s ability to provide <em>zero crossing turn-off</em>. Discuss why this might be important when controlling power to inductive loads.</p>
