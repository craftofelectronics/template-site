<p>Use circuit simulation software to verify your predicted and measured parameter values.</p>
<p>You will need an AC signal source of variable voltage, so that the reference voltage at test point <strong>A</strong> (<span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>A</em></sub></span>) may be precisely adjusted to 1 volt RMS. The frequency of the signal source must be within the range of the voltmeter to measure, of course. You may use a sine-wave signal generator as the source, but a step-down transformer and series potentiometer works just as well! The purpose of this exercise is not how to calculate voltage divider outputs, but rather how to utilize a dB-reading meter to measure signal strength in decibels rather than volts AC.</p>
<p>Most high-quality digital multimeters will measure dBV in addition to AC volts RMS. Some have a &quot;zero&quot; or &quot;relative&quot; button which acts like the &quot;tare&quot; button on an electronic weigh scale. With such a meter, one may set 0 dB to reference at <em>any</em> measurable level of AC voltage. Of course, this means the meter will be measuring dB instead of dBV, since the reference point is made arbitrary with the press of the &quot;relative&quot; button. However, this is a very useful tool for electronic signal measurements, where source strength may be set to 0 dB and then losses measured directly in -dB (relative to the source) just as easily as normal voltage measurements.</p>
