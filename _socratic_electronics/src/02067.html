<p>The letters &quot;MOS&quot; in the acronym &quot;MOSFET&quot; stand for &quot;Metal Oxide Semiconductor&quot;. Describe what this means, in reference to the construction of a MOSFET.</p>
<p>The &quot;Oxide&quot; referred to is a layer of insulating material placed between the Metal gate terminal and the Semiconducting field-effect channel.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: MOSFETs are sometimes referred to as &quot;IGFETs&quot;. Explain what this other acronym stands for, and how it means the same thing as &quot;MOSFET&quot;.</p>
<p>Explain to your students that IGFET is a more general term than MOSFET, as silicon dioxide is not the only suitable material from which to make an insulating layer for the gate.</p>
