<p>A hobbyist decides to build a microphone preamplifier circuit, using an operational amplifier to control gain:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03948x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Unfortunately, the particular op-amp chosen by the hobbyist seems to distort the signal at high frequencies. The hobbyist decides to look for a different model of op-amp, and asks you (an electronics technician) for advice on choosing a better one. What specific operational amplifier performance parameter would you suggest the hobbyist look for in a new op-amp, and should this parameter be small or great in order to fix the distortion problem?</p>
<p>Parameter = Ideally <em>small</em> or ideally <em>great</em>?</p>
<p>Parameter = &quot;slew rate,&quot; ideally <em>great</em></p>
