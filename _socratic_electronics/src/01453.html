<p>What would happen if a 10 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>F capacitor, charged to a voltage of 6 volts, were connected to a completely discharged (0 volts) 22 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>F capacitor?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01453x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>What would the voltage(s) be across each capacitor, after enough time had passed for complete equalization to occur?</p>
<p>Voltage across each capacitor = 1.875 volts.</p>
<p>The most important aspect of your students’ answers is <em>how</em> they arrived at them. There is more than one way to solve this problem!</p>
