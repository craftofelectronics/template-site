<p>Complete the circuit, showing how the pushbutton switch could be connected to the gate of the MOSFET in order to exert control over the load:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02124x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>This solution, while workable, is not the most practical. Improve on this design!</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02124x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Follow-up question: would you say this transistor <em>sources</em> current to the load, or <em>sinks</em> current from the load? Explain your answer.</p>
<p>Discuss with your students why the circuit shown in the answer would not necessarily be practical, and work together to develop a better design.</p>
