<p>An improvement to the resistor-based differential amplifier design is the addition of a constant-current source where the two transistors’ emitter currents mesh together:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00936x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>What does the constant-current source &quot;look like&quot; to the rest of the amplifier, in terms of equivalent resistance? What advantage does this give to the amplifier’s performance, over the (simpler) resistor design? Finally, how is this constant-current source actually constructed in a typical differential amplifier circuit?</p>
<p>A constant-current source will &quot;look like&quot; a very large resistance to the rest of the circuit. This gives the amplifier a larger common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR). Usually, the current source is constructed using a <em>current mirror</em> circuit.</p>
<p>Ask your students to define CMRR and explain its importance in a differential amplifier circuit. Analyze the effects of common-mode input voltage on a simple resistor-based differential amplifier circuit, and then compare it to the circuit having a constant current source. How does the current source work to improve CMRR (reduce common-mode gain)?</p>
<p>Also, have your students draw a current mirror for this differential amplifier circuit and explain how it works.</p>
<p>I am expecting that your students have seen (or can research) the CMRR approximation for a differential pair circuit (CMRR <span class="math">$\approx {R_E \over r'_e}$</span>), and from this can deduce the importance of using a current source in the tail of the circuit instead of a passive resistor.</p>
