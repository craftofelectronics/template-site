<p>What began as an exponential problem ended up as a multiplication problem, through the application of logarithms. What does this tell you about the utility of logarithms as an arithmetic tool?</p>
<p>That logarithms can reduce the complexity of an equation from exponentiation, down to multiplication, indicates its usefulness as a tool to <em>simplify</em> arithmetic problems. Specifically, the logarithm of a number raised to a power is equal to that power multiplied by the logarithm of the number.</p>
<p>In mathematics, any procedure that reduces a complex type of problem into a simpler type of problem is called a <em>transform function</em>, and logarithms are one of the simplest types of transform functions in existence.</p>
