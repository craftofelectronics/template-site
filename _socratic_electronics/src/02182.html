<p>Suppose that a single-phase AC electric motor is performing mechanical work at a rate of 45 horsepower. This equates to 33.57 kW of power, given the equivalence of watts to horsepower (1 HP <span class="math"> ≈ </span> 746 W).</p>
<p>Calculate the amount of line current necessary to power this motor if the line voltage is 460 volts, assuming 100% motor efficiency and a power factor of 1.</p>
<p>Now re-calculate the necessary line current for this motor if its power factor drops to 0.65. Assume the same efficiency (100%) and the same amount of mechanical power (45 HP).</p>
<p>What do these calculations indicate about the importance of maintaining a high power factor value in an AC circuit?</p>
<p>P.F. = 1 ; current = 72.98 amps</p>
<p>P.F. = 0.65 ; current = 112.3 amps</p>
<p>Follow-up question: what is the &quot;extra&quot; current in the 0.65 power factor scenario doing, if not contributing to the motor’s mechanical power output?</p>
<p>Points of discussion for this question should be rather obvious: why is a current of 112.3 amps worse than a current of 72.98 amps when the exact same amount of mechanical work is being done? What circuit components would have to be oversized to accommodate this extra current?</p>
