<p>Draw the schematic diagram for an experimental circuit to gather data necessary to plot the voltage/current graph of a gas discharge lamp.</p>

<p>One of my goals as a technical educator is to encourage the development of experimentation skills in my students. The most accurate way to gain knowledge of a device’s operation or of an electrical principle is to build a circuit that actually tests it. I’ve used this technique many times in my career to further my knowledge on a subject, and it has proven to be an invaluable skill.</p>
<p>In this question, students are implicitly asked to identify several key things:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Where to connect a meter to measure lamp voltage.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Where to connect a meter to measure lamp current.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> How to make the current adjustable, so that multiple values may be tested and plotted.</p>
<p>Additionally, the students must identify what voltage/current ranges will be necessary to test a gas-discharge lamp. Notice the high-voltage power source shown in the schematic diagram. Students may ask &quot;How high must this voltage be?&quot; upon seeing the schematic in the answer. Don’t tell them outright. Rather, have them do some research and report the next day on typical lamp voltages!</p>
