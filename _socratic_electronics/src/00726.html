<p><em>Shunt</em> resistors used for precision current measurement always have four terminals for the electrical connections, even though normal resistors only have two:</p>

<p>Explain what would be wrong with connecting the voltmeter movement directly to the same two terminals conducting high current through the shunt resistor, like this:</p>

<p>A two-wire shunt resistor connection will not be as accurate as a four-wire shunt resistor, due to stray resistance within the bolted connection between the wires and the body of the shunt resistor.</p>
<p>Challenge question: draw a schematic diagram showing all stray resistances within the two-wire shunt connection circuit, in order to clarify the concept.</p>
<p>Though a few fractions of an ohm of &quot;stray&quot; resistance may not seem like much, they are significant when contrasted against the already (very) low resistance of the shunt resistor’s body.</p>
<p>One of the conceptual difficulties I’ve encountered with students on numerous occasions is confusion over <em>how much</em> resistance, voltage, current, etc., constitutes a &quot;significant&quot; amount. For example, I’ve had students tell me that the difference between 296,342.5 ohms and 296,370.9 ohms is &quot;really big,&quot; when in fact it is less than ten thousandths of a percent of the base resistance values. Students simply subtract the two resistances and obtain 28.4 ohms, then think that &quot;28.4&quot; is a significant quantity because it is comparable to some of the other values they’re used to dealing with (100 ohms, 500 ohms, 1000 ohms, etc.).</p>
<p>Conversely, students may fail to see the significance of a few hundredths of an ohm of stray resistance in a shunt resistor circuit, when the entire resistance of the shunt resistor itself is only a few hundredths of an ohm. What matters most in problems of accuracy is the <em>percentage</em> or error, not the absolute value of the error itself. This is another practical application of <em>estimating skills</em>, which you should reinforce at every opportunity.</p>
