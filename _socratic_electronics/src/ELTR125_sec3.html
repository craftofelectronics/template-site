<p>The only real difficulty here is the lapse in time between when most students study RC circuit analysis and the time they study phase-shift oscillator circuits. Calculating the phase shift of a series RC circuit is as simple as drawing its impedance triangle, and then properly identifying which two sides represent the input (total) and output voltages in order to identify which angle you must calculate.</p>
<p>No doubt about it, Fourier analysis is a strange concept to understand. Strange, but incredibly useful! While it is relatively easy to grasp the principle that we may create a square-shaped wave (or any other symmetrical waveshape) by mixing together the right combinations of sine waves at different frequencies and amplitudes, it is far from obvious that <em>any</em> periodic waveform may be decomposed into a series of sinusoidal waves the same way. The practical upshot of this is that is it possible to consider very complex waveshapes as being nothing more than a bunch of sine waves added together. Since sine waves are easy to analyze in the context of electric circuits, this means we have a way of simplifying what would otherwise be a dauntingly complex problem: analyzing how circuits respond to non-sinusoidal waveforms.</p>
<p>The actual &quot;nuts and bolts&quot; of Fourier analysis is highly mathematical and well beyond the scope of this course. Right now all I want you to grasp is the concept and significance of equivalence between arbitrary waveshapes and series of sine waves.</p>
<p>A great way to experience this equivalence is to play with a digital oscilloscope with a built-in spectrum analyzer. By introducing different wave-shape signals to the input and switching back and forth between the time-domain (scope) and frequency-domain (spectrum) displays, you may begin to see patterns that will enlighten your understanding.</p>
