<p>The following voltmeter circuit avoids problems of &quot;loading&quot; when measuring high-resistance voltage sources. Describe how to operate this circuit, and how loading error is eliminated by using such a <em>potentiometric</em> instrument:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00529x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Move the switch to the &quot;Bal&quot; position and adjust the potentiometer until the meter movement registers zero volts precisely. Then, move the switch to the &quot;Meas&quot; position and read the voltage directly from the meter movement.</p>
<p>&quot;Potentiometric&quot; DC voltage measurements used to be commonplace in industry prior to the advent of precision electronic voltmeters with high-resistance inputs. The technique, though, is certainly not obsolete, and in fact is still employed in metrological laboratories worldwide to obtain the most accurate (no-load) voltage measurements possible.</p>
<p>It is impressive to have students build a potentiometric voltmeter circuit using a cheap analog VOM (Volt-Ohm-Milliammeter), and have it outperform a direct-reading, laboratory-quality digital voltmeter costing hundreds of dollars! The greater the resistance inherent to the voltage source being measured, the more severe the loading error of any voltmeter, and the more a potentiometric instrument proves its worth.</p>
