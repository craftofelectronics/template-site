<p>In this circuit, is the light bulb lit? Why or why not?</p>
<p>Also, compare the relative indications of the two ammeters (which ammeter registers the greatest amount of current, and which ammeter registers the least amount of current, or do they both register the same amount of current?).</p>

<p>The bulb is lit, but ammeter &quot;A&quot; registers much more current than ammeter &quot;B&quot;.</p>
<p>Exactly what ammeter &quot;B&quot; will register (aside from its indication being less then ammeter &quot;A&quot;), is an interesting question.</p>
