<p>Inductors store energy in the form of a magnetic field. We may calculate the energy stored in an inductance by integrating the product of inductor voltage and inductor current (<span class="math"><em>P</em> = <em>I</em><em>V</em></span>) over time, since we know that power is the rate at which work (<span class="math"><em>W</em></span>) is done, and the amount of work done to an inductor taking it from zero current to some non-zero amount of current constitutes energy stored (<span class="math"><em>U</em></span>):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$P = {dW \over dt}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math"><em>d</em><em>W</em> = <em>P</em> <em>d</em><em>t</em></span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math"><em>U</em> = <em>W</em> = ∫ <em>P</em> <em>d</em><em>t</em></span><br /></p>
<p>Find a way to substitute inductance (<span class="math"><em>L</em></span>) and current (<span class="math"><em>I</em></span>) into the integrand so you may integrate to find an equation describing the amount of energy stored in an inductor for any given inductance and current values.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$U = {1 \over 2}LI^2$</span><br /></p>
<p>The integration required to obtain the answer is commonly found in calculus-based physics textbooks, and is an easy (power rule) integration.</p>
