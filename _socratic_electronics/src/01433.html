<p>A student builds their first astable 555 timer circuit, using a TLC555CP chip. Unfortunately, it seems to have a problem. Sometimes, the output of the timer simply stops oscillating, with no apparent cause. Stranger yet, the problem often occurs at the precise time anyone moves their hand within a few inches of the circuit board (without actually touching anything!).</p>
<p>What could the student have done wrong in assembling this circuit to cause such a problem? What steps would you take to troubleshoot this problem?</p>
<p>I wonâ€™t reveal the most probable cause, but I will give you this hint: the TLC555CP integrated circuit (&quot;chip&quot;) uses CMOS technology.</p>
<p>Every year it seems I have at least one student who experiences this particular problem, usually as a result of hasty circuit assembly (not making all necessary connections to pins on the chip). This is a good question to brainstorm with your class on, exploring possible causes and methods of diagnosis.</p>
