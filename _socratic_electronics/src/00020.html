<p>What will this voltmeter register when connected to a battery as shown (assume a battery voltage of 6 volts)? Explain your answer.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00020x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>I could simply give you the answer, but this problem is so easy to simulate in real life that Iâ€™d rather let you try it yourself!</p>
<p>Follow-up question: what does this tell you about the nature of voltage, and how it is measured?</p>
<p>This question affords an excellent opportunity to discuss another foundational concept of electricity: that <em>voltage is always measured between two points</em>.</p>
