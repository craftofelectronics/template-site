<p>Suppose a voltmeter has a range of 0 to 10 volts, and an internal resistance of 100 k<span class="math">Ω </span>:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00369x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Show how a single resistor could be connected to this voltmeter to extend its range to <em>0 to 50</em> volts. Calculate the resistance of this &quot;range&quot; resistor, as well as its necessary power dissipation rating.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00369x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>A power dissipation rating of <span class="math">${1 \over 8}$</span> watt would be more than sufficient for this application.</p>
<p>Voltmeter ranging is a very practical example of voltage divider circuitry.</p>
