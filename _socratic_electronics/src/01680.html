<p>A common term used in semiconductor circuit engineering is <em>small signal analysis</em>. What, exactly, is &quot;small signal&quot; analysis, and how does it contrast with <em>large signal analysis</em>?</p>
<p><em>Small signal analysis</em> is where the signals are presumed to be small enough in magnitude that the active device(s) should respond in a nearly linear manner. <em>Large signal analysis</em> is where the signals are presumed to be large enough that component nonlinearities become significant.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: why would engineers bother with two modes of analysis instead of just one (large signal), where the componentsâ€™ true (nonlinear) behavior is taken into account? Explain this in terms of network theorems and other mathematical &quot;tools&quot; available to engineers for circuit analysis.</p>
<p>When researching engineering textbooks and other resources, these terms are quite often used without introduction, leaving many beginning students confused.</p>
