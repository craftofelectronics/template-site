<p>Suppose someone wires a DPDT switch to an electric motor like this, hoping to achieve forward/reverse control:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00699x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Unfortunately, this switch arrangement will <em>not</em> reverse the motor!</p>
<p>Explain why the motor will not reverse, and determine a correction to the circuit that will allow the switch to function as a forward/reverse control.</p>
<p>This switching circuit will not reverse the motor, because it reverses polarity on <em>both</em> the armature and the field.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: what does this fact tell us about the motor’s ability to operate on alternating current (AC)?</p>
<p>There is more than one solution for the reversing problem. Discuss your students’ solutions, and encourage the submission of multiple ideas! One thing you might want to mention is that the field winding of a shunt-wound DC motor like this typically draws far less current than the armature winding (especially under full load). Ask your students how this fact might influence their decision on how to re-design the switch circuit.</p>
