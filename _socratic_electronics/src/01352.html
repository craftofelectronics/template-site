<p>Latch circuits are often drawn as complete units in their own block symbols, rather than as a collection of individual gates:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01352x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>This simplifies schematic drawings where latches are used, much as the use of gate symbolism (as opposed to drawing individual transistors and resistors) simplifies the diagrams of more elementary digital circuits.</p>
<p>From the block symbols shown in this question, is there any way to determine which of the S-R latches is built with NOR gates, and which one is built with NAND gates?</p>
<p>This is a bit of a trick question. If NOR and NAND are the only gate choices available, then the left latch is made from NOR gates and the right latch is made from NAND gates. However, it is possible to make S-R latches out of gates other than NOR or NAND.</p>
<p>Challenge question: can you think of other gate types that could be used to build S-R latch circuits? Hint: there are at least <em>two</em> alternatives to NOR and NAND!</p>
<p>If students become stuck on the challenge question, just whisper &quot;DeMorganâ€™s Theorem&quot; to them and watch what happens!</p>
