<p>What do the symbols with the question marks next to them refer to? In the circuit shown, would the light bulb be energized?</p>

<p>These are <em>ground</em> symbols, and they can either refer to connections made to a common conductor (such as the metal chassis of an automobile or circuit enclosure), or the actual earth (usually via metal rods driven into the dirt).</p>
<p>Ask the students about the relative conductivities of metal chassis versus dirt (earth ground). Is a current pathway formed by two metal chassis grounds equivalent to a current pathway formed by two earth grounds? Why or why not? What conditions may affect these relative conductivities?</p>
