<p>Bipolar junction transistors (BJTs) are considered &quot;normally-off&quot; devices, because their natural state with no signal applied to the base is no conduction between emitter and collector, like an open switch. Are insulate-gate field-effect transistors (IGFETs) considered the same? Why or why not?</p>
<p>IGFETs may be manufactured <em>either</em> as &quot;normally-on&quot; or &quot;normally-off&quot; devices.</p>
<p>Ask your students to elaborate on the answer given. Do not accept a mindless recitation of the answer, that &quot;it depends on how theyâ€™re manufactured,&quot; but rather demand that some sort of explanation be given as to <em>why</em> an IGFET would be normally-on versus normally-off.</p>
