<p>The purpose of this circuit is to perform a timing function, turning on the LED for a limited amount of time when the switch is thrown to the right:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03033x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Suppose the switch begins in the left position, then is thrown to the right for exactly 1 second. During that 1 second of time, how much total time does the LED spend energized (on), and how much total time does the LED spend de-energized (off)?</p>
<p>LED total on time = LED total off time =</p>
<p>LED total on time = 0.3431 s LED total off time = 0.6569 s</p>
