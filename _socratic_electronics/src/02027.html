<p>Explain why it is important for optimum performance to connect speakers of the proper impedance to an audio power amplifier.</p>
<p>Improper speaker impedance may result in low power output (excessive <span class="math"><em>Z</em></span>) or overheating of the amplifier (insufficient <span class="math"><em>Z</em></span>).</p>
<p>Follow-up question: since consumer-grade audio speakers are typically uniform in impedance (8 <span class="math">Ω </span> is a very popular value), how would it be possible to connect a wrong speaker impedance to an audio power amplifier?</p>
<p>I find it typical that students of electronics new to basic electrical theory are fascinated by discussions related to audio technology, as it is difficult to find someone who does not in some way appreciate music. This is a good thing, for the more &quot;real&quot; you can make your students’ classroom experience, the better they will learn.</p>
