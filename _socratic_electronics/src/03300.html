<p>With a trough of water and three pieces of wire, you could make a <em>liquid potentiometer</em>:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03300x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Which way would you have to move the middle wire (the one touching the voltmeter’s red test lead) in order to increase the voltmeter’s reading?</p>
<p>Move the wire to the left in order to make the voltmeter register a greater voltage.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: identify any advantages and disadvantages of such a &quot;liquid pot&quot; over standard potentiometers using solid pieces. Are there any potential safety hazards that occur to you as you look at the illustration of this liquid potentiometer?</p>
<p>Believe it or not, I have actually seen an application in industry where a &quot;liquid rheostat&quot; (not a potentiometer, but close) was used rather than a device made from solid parts. Very interesting. Very dangerous as well, since it was being used as part of a large motor speed control circuit, handling many amps of current at potentially deadly voltages! I do not know what maniac thought of building this contraption, but it was built and had been working for a number of years.</p>
