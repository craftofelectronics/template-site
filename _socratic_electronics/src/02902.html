<p>NAME:</p>
<p><strong>Metacognitive Survey</strong></p>
<p><span class="math">1. </span> Describe some <em>specific</em> things you learned in the last course section:</p>
<p><span class="math">2. </span> Identify one or more <em>specific</em> concepts in this course section you found relatively easy to understand:</p>
<p><span class="math">3. </span> Do those concepts share anything in common with other concepts you have found easy to understand in the past? If so, what is common between them?</p>
<p><span class="math">4. </span> Identify one or more <em>specific</em> concepts in this course section you found confusing:</p>
<p><span class="math">5. </span> Do those concepts share anything in common with other concepts you have found confusing in the past? If so, what is common between them?</p>
<p><span class="math">6. </span> Identify at least one concept or skill you will devote more study and practice to:</p>
<p><span class="math">7. </span> How well were you able to budget your time during this last course section? Identify at least one thing you can do (starting <em>today</em>) to better manage your time:</p>
<p><span class="math">8. </span> Describe at least one specific action you will take (starting <em>today</em>) to overcome your most significant learning obstacle.</p>
<p><span class="math">9. </span> If the last action you took to overcome a learning obstacle was not successful, explain why:</p>
<p><strong>Remember: are ultimately responsible for your own learning. No one can force you to learn, and no one can achieve your goals for you.</strong></p>
<p>Be sure to give specific answers. If you cannot think of something to write as an answer, you are not thinking deeply enough. If you think of &quot;everything&quot; in response to questions regarding difficult concepts and learning obstacles, you either need to take a lower-level course or you are not thinking deeply enough about your own learning process. If you cannot be specific in answering these questions, you need to see your instructor for help, because he/she will definitely be able to recognize specific weaknesses after working with you.</p>
<p><em>Metacognition</em> is awareness of one’s own thought processes, and in my opinion is the most important skill one can gain from higher education. To be able to monitor and assess one’s own learning, and to take corrective action to overcome weaknesses, is vital in becoming a self-directed learner. While every dedicated and competent instructor strives to develop metacognitive skills in their students, it is not often taught explicitly. The purpose of this question is to remind students of the importance of metacognition and to help them become self-reflective by asking them to complete a survey about what they have learned, how they learned it, what obstacles they had to overcome, and what specific actions they will take to overcome remaining obstacles.</p>
