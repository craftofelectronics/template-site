<p><em>Impedance</em> is defined as the complex ratio of voltage and current:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">${\bf Z} = {{\bf V}\over {\bf I}}$</span><br /></p>
<p>We may determine the complex definition of impedance provided by an capacitor if we consider the equation relating capacitor voltage and capacitor current:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$i = C {d \over dt} [ v(t) ]$</span><br /></p>
<p>First, substitute a phasor expression of voltage into the above equation, then differentiate with respect to time to obtain an expression for current:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math"><em>v</em>(<em>t</em>) = <em>e</em><sup><em>j</em><em>ω</em><em>t</em></sup></span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$i = C {d \over dt} \left[ e^{j \omega t} \right]$</span><br /></p>
<p>Then, divide the two phasor expressions to obtain an expression for capacitive impedance.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">${\bf Z_C} = {1 \over {j \omega C}} \hbox{\hskip 30pt or \hskip 30pt} {\bf Z_C} = -j {1 \over {\omega C}}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Follow-up question: explain why the following expression for capacitive impedance is equivalent to the one shown above:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">${\bf Z_C} = {1 \over {\omega C}} \&gt;  e^{j (-\pi / 2)}$</span><br /></p>
<p>In order to solve this problem, your students must remember the basic rule for differentiating exponential functions:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">${d \over dx} \left[ e^{ax} \right] = a e^{ax}$</span><br /></p>
<p>This is one of the beauties of representing sinusoidal voltages and currents in complex exponential (phasor) form: it makes differentiation and integration relatively easy! In this sense, the Euler relation of <span class="math"><em>e</em><sup><em>j</em><em>x</em></sup> = cos<em>x</em> + <em>j</em>sin<em>x</em></span> is a <em>transform function</em>, transforming one type of mathematical problem into a different (easier) type.</p>
