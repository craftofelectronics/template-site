<p>The simple switch-and-diode circuit shown here is an example of a digital <em>encoder</em>. Explain what this circuit does, as the switch is moved from position to position:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01408x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>This encoder generates a three-bit binary code corresponding to the switch position (one out of eight positions).</p>
<p>Follow-up question: trace the path of electron flow through the circuit with the switch in position #3.</p>
<p>Challenge question: are there other codes (besides binary) that could possibly be generated with a circuit of this general design?</p>
<p>Ask your students to explain how the term &quot;encoder&quot; applies to this simple circuit. What, exactly, is being encoded, and what form of code is the data being converted to?</p>
