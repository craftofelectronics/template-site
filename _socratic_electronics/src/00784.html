<p>A very common form of full-wave rectifier circuit is the <em>bridge rectifier</em>. Typically, it is drawn as a &quot;diamond&quot; of four diodes:</p>

<p>Draw the connections in this illustration to form a bridge rectifier circuit, receiving power from the transformer and delivering power to the light bulb:</p>

<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00784x03.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Follow-up question: draw the direction of currents through the bridge rectifier for each half-cycle of the AC power source, and determine the DC voltage polarity across the light bulb terminals.</p>
<p>Realistic connection problems such as this are much easier to solve in the presence of a schematic diagram. If you have students who struggle with this question, make sure they take the time to draw a schematic <em>first</em>. Finding a schematic diagram of a full-wave bridge rectifier circuit to copy is no challenge at all. As a rule, I do not offer assistance to students with questions until they have at least taken this first step, because so often they end up answering their own questions in the process of drawing a schematic diagram!</p>
