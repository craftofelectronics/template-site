<p>Compare the following two circuits, the first one being a digital adder and the second one being an analog summer:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02849x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02849x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>These two circuits perform the same mathematical function, yet the manners in which they perform this function are quite different. Compare and contrast the digital adder and the analog summer circuits shown here, citing any advantages or disadvantages of each.</p>
<p>I won’t directly give away answers here, but I will list a few criteria you might want to use for comparing and contrasting:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Resolution</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Accuracy</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Speed</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Cost</p>
<p>This question is not really specific to adder/summer circuits, as it may first appear. The fundamental comparison being drawn in this question is between digital and analog. This is an important concept for students to grasp, as both have their roles in modern electronics. A common fallacy is that &quot;digital is better&quot; in all circumstances, but the truth is that both digital and analog have their respective strengths and limitations.</p>
