<p>Use a triangle to calculate the total voltage of the source for this series RC circuit, given the voltage drop across each component:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02107x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Explain what equation(s) you use to calculate <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>t</em><em>o</em><em>t</em><em>a</em><em>l</em></sub></span>, as well as why we must geometrically add these voltages together.</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>t</em><em>o</em><em>t</em><em>a</em><em>l</em></sub></span> = 3.672 volts, as calculated by the Pythagorean Theorem</p>
<p>Be sure to have students show you the form of the Pythagorean Theorem, rather than showing them yourself, since it is so easy for students to research on their own.</p>
