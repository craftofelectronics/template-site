<p>Suppose you needed to choose two resistance values to make a voltage divider with a limited adjustment range:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03105x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Set up a system of simultaneous equations to solve for both <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span>, and show how you arrived at the solutions for each.</p>
<p>Hint: remember the series resistor voltage divider formula . . .</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$V_R = V_{total}\left( {R \over R_{total}} \right)$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> = 5.25 k<span class="math">Ω </span></p>
<p><span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span> = 2.25 k<span class="math">Ω </span></p>
<p>Be sure to have your students set up their equations in front of the class so everyone can see how they did it. Some students may opt to apply Ohm’s Law to the solution of both resistors, which is good, but for the purpose of developing equations to fit problems it might not be the best solution. Challenge your students to come up with a <em>set of equations</em> that solve for <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span>, then use techniques for solution of simultaneous equations to arrive at solutions for each.</p>
