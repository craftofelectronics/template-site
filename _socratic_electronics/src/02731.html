<p>Calculate the voltage gain for each stage of this amplifier circuit (both as a ratio and in units of decibels), then calculate the overall voltage gain:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02731x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math"></span> Stage 1:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math"><em>A</em><sub><em>V</em></sub></span> = 0.490 = -6.193 dB</p>
<p><span class="math"></span> Stage 2:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math"><em>A</em><sub><em>V</em></sub></span> = 3.128 = 9.904 dB</p>
<p><span class="math"></span> Overall:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math"><em>A</em><sub><em>V</em></sub></span> = 1.533 = 3.712 dB</p>
<p>Follow-up question: is this circuit inverting or noninverting, overall?</p>
<p>Not only does this question review calculation of voltage gain for inverting amplifier circuits, but it also reviews decibel calculations (for both single and multi-stage amplifiers). Discuss how the decibel figures for each stage add to equal the total decibel gain, whereas the ratios multiply.</p>
