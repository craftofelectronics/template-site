<p>Choose appropriate values for this Sallen-Key high-pass filter circuit to give it a cutoff frequency of 7 kHz with a &quot;Butterworth&quot; response:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02575x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$f_{-3dB} = {\sqrt{2} \over {2 \pi R C}}$</span><br /></p>
<p>A good guideline to follow is to make sure no component impedance (<span class="math"><em>Z</em><sub><em>R</em></sub></span> or <span class="math"><em>Z</em><sub><em>C</em></sub></span>) at the cutoff frequency is less than 1 k<span class="math">Ω </span> or greater than 100 k<span class="math">Ω </span>.</p>
<p>Bear in mind that this is just one possible set of component values:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math"><em>C</em></span> = 3.3 nF</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math"><em>R</em></span> = 9.744 k<span class="math">Ω </span></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math">${R \over 2}$</span> = 4.872 k<span class="math">Ω </span></p>
<p>Follow-up question: how would you suggest we obtain the precise resistance values necessary to build this circuit?</p>
<p>In order for students to solve for <span class="math"><em>R</em></span>, they must algebraically manipulate the cutoff frequency formula. Ask them why we might choose a standard value for capacitance and then calculate a non-standard value for resistance. Why not the other way around (first choose <span class="math"><em>R</em></span>, then calculate <span class="math"><em>C</em></span>)?</p>
