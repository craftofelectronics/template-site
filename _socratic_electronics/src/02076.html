<p>The <em>impedance triangle</em> is often used to graphically relate <span class="math"><em>Z</em></span>, <span class="math"><em>R</em></span>, and <span class="math"><em>X</em></span> in a series circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02076x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Unfortunately, many students do not grasp the significance of this triangle, but rather memorize it as a &quot;trick&quot; used to calculate one of the three variables given the other two. Explain <em>why</em> a right triangle is an appropriate form to relate these variables, and what each side of the triangle actually represents.</p>
<p>Each side of the impedance triangle is actually a <em>phasor</em> (a vector representing impedance with magnitude and direction):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02076x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Since the phasor for resistive impedance (<span class="math"><em>Z</em><sub><em>R</em></sub></span>) has an angle of zero degrees and the phasor for reactive impedance (<span class="math"><em>Z</em><sub><em>C</em></sub></span> or <span class="math"><em>Z</em><sub><em>L</em></sub></span>) either has an angle of +90 or -90 degrees, the <em>phasor sum</em> representing total series impedance will form the hypotenuse of a right triangle when the first to phasors are added (tip-to-tail).</p>
<p>Follow-up question: as a review, explain why resistive impedance phasors always have an angle of zero degrees, and why reactive impedance phasors always have angles of either +90 degrees or -90 degrees.</p>
<p>The question is sufficiently open-ended that many students may not realize exactly what is being asked until they read the answer. This is okay, as it is difficult to phrase the question in a more specific manner without giving away the answer!</p>
