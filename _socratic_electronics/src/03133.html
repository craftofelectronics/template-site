<p>Match the following time-delay relay contact type symbols and labels:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03133x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Normally-open, timed-closed</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Normally-open, timed-open</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Normally-closed, timed-closed</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Normally-closed, timed-open</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03133x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Follow-up question: how do you make sense of the arrow in each contact symbol, with regard to whether the contact is timed-open or timed-closed?</p>
<p>Ask your students to present their personal explanations of how to make sense of the arrow directions, in relation to whether the relay is &quot;timed-open&quot; or &quot;timed-closed.&quot; The correlation is really not that complex, but it is a good thing to clearly elaborate on it for the benefit of the whole class. You may want to re-phrase the question like this: &quot;Does the arrow represent the direction of timed motion or the direction of instantaneous motion?&quot;</p>
