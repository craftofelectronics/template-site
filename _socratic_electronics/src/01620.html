<p>Use circuit simulation software to verify your predicted and actual truth tables.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the input states in this circuit are defined by the voltage levels, not by the contact status. In other words, a closed contact equals a &quot;low&quot; (0) logic state.</p>
<p>I strongly recommend having students build their logic circuits with CMOS chips rather than TTL, because of the less stringent power supply requirements of CMOS. I also recommend drawing a combinational circuit using four gates, because this is the common number of two-input gates found on 14-pin DIP logic chips.</p>
