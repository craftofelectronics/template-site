<p>Suppose a non-sinusoidal voltage source is represented by the following Fourier series:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math"><em>v</em>(<em>t</em>) = 23. 2 + 30sin(377<em>t</em>) + 15. 5sin(1131<em>t</em> + 90) + 2. 7sin(1508<em>t</em> − 40)</span><br /></p>
<p>Electrically, we might represent this non-sinusoidal voltage source as a circle, like this:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02259x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Knowing the Fourier series of this voltage, however, allows us to represent the same voltage source as a set of series-connected voltage sources, each with its own (sinusoidal) frequency. Draw the equivalent schematic in this manner, labeling each voltage source with its RMS voltage value, frequency (in Hz), and phase angle:</p>
<p>Hint: <span class="math"><em>ω</em> = 2<em>π</em><em>f</em></span></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02259x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The purpose of this question is to have students relate the sinusoidal terms of a particular Fourier series to a schematic diagram, translating between angular velocity and frequency, peak values and RMS values.</p>
