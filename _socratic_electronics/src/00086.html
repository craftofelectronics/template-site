<p>Plot the relationships between voltage and current for resistors of three different values (1 <span class="math">Ω </span>, 2 <span class="math">Ω </span>, and 3 <span class="math">Ω </span>), all on the same graph:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00086x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>What pattern do you see represented by your three plots? What relationship is there between the amount of resistance and the nature of the voltage/current function as it appears on the graph?</p>
<p><strong>Advanced question:</strong> in calculus, the instantaneous rate-of-change of an (<span class="math"><em>x</em>, <em>y</em></span>) function is expressed through the use of the <em>derivative</em> notation: <span class="math">${dy \over dx}$</span>. How would the derivative for each of these three plots be properly expressed using calculus notation? Explain how the derivatives of these functions relate to real electrical quantities.</p>
<p>The greater the resistance, the steeper the slope of the plotted line.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced answer:</strong> the proper way to express the derivative of each of these plots is <span class="math">${dv \over di}$</span>. The derivative of a linear function is a constant, and in each of these three cases that constant equals the resistor resistance in ohms. So, we could say that for simple resistor circuits, the instantaneous rate-of-change for a voltage/current function <em>is</em> the resistance of the circuit.</p>
<p>Students need to become comfortable with graphs, and creating their own simple graphs is an excellent way to develop this understanding. A graphical representation of the Ohm’s Law function allows students another &quot;view&quot; of the concept, allowing them to more easily understand more advanced concepts such as <em>negative</em> resistance.</p>
<p>If students have access to either a graphing calculator or computer software capable of drawing 2-dimensional graphs, encourage them to plot the functions using these technological resources.</p>
<p>I have found it a good habit to &quot;sneak&quot; mathematical concepts into physical science courses whenever possible. For so many people, math is an abstract and confusing subject, which may be understood only in the context of real-life application. The studies of electricity and electronics are rich in mathematical context, so exploit it whenever possible! Your students will greatly benefit.</p>
