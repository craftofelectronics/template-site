<p>Design an experimental circuit for determining the <em>pull-in</em> and <em>drop-out</em> current values for an electromagnetic relay coil. Why would these statistics matter to us, when working with relay circuits?</p>
<p>The circuit for measuring these values is quite simple. I leave the task of designing it in your capable hands!</p>
<p>The real challenge of this question, of course, is for the students to determine what in the world &quot;pull-in&quot; and &quot;drop-out&quot; current values are. Once these definitions have been found, it is a very simple matter to experimentally determine them for any given relay.</p>
