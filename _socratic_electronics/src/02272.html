<p>Determine the frequency spectrum for a high-frequency, sine wave &quot;carrier&quot; signal that is <em>amplitude-modulated</em> (AM) by an audio-frequency signal with a spectrum of its own. The spectra for these respective waveforms are shown individually:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02272x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02272x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Plot the modulated signal spectrum here:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02272x04.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02272x03.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The purpose of this question is to get students to recognize where sidebands come from, and to recognize their symmetry about the carrier peak.</p>
<p>In case anyone happens to ask, the equal scaling of the sidebands around the carrier on the answer spectrum implies a <em>linear</em> frequency scale.</p>
