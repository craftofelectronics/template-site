<p>The nonconducting depletion region of a PN junction forms a parasitic capacitance between the P and the N semiconductor region. Does the capacitance increase or decrease as a greater reverse-bias voltage is applied to the PN junction? Explain your answer.</p>
<p>The junction capacitance will decrease as the reverse-bias voltage across the junction increases.</p>
<p>Challenge question: can you think of any practical applications for this variable-capacitance effect?</p>
<p>This question is a good review of capacitor theory, and also an opportunity to introduce a special kind of diode: the <em>varactor</em>.</p>
