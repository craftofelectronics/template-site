<p>Use circuit simulation software to verify your predicted and measured parameter values.</p>
<p>Use a dual-voltage, regulated power supply to supply power to the opamp. Specify standard resistor values, all between 1 k<span class="math">Ω </span> and 100 k<span class="math">Ω </span> (1k5, 2k2, 2k7, 3k3, 4k7, 5k1, 6k8, 10k, 22k, 33k, 39k 47k, 68k, etc.).</p>
<p>I have had good success using the following values:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> +V = +12 volts</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> -V = -12 volts</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>i</em><em>n</em></sub></span> = 1 V peak-to-peak, at 10 kHz</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> = 10 k<span class="math">Ω </span></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span> = 100 k<span class="math">Ω </span></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math"><em>C</em><sub>1</sub></span> = 0.001 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>F</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math"><em>U</em><sub>1</sub></span> = one-half of LM1458 dual operational amplifier</p>
<p>A good follow-up activity for this circuit is to change the input frequency, and predict/measure the phase shift (<span class="math">Θ </span>) between input and output for sinusoidal waveforms. The results may be surprising, especially if you are accustomed to the behavior of a <em>passive</em> integrator circuit.</p>
<p>An extension of this exercise is to incorporate troubleshooting questions. Whether using this exercise as a performance assessment or simply as a concept-building lab, you might want to follow up your students’ results by asking them to predict the consequences of certain circuit faults.</p>
