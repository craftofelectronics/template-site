<p>An important parameter for many semiconductor components is <em>thermal resistance</em>, usually specified in units of degrees Celsius per Watt. What does this rating mean, and how is it related to temperature?</p>
<p>&quot;Thermal resistance&quot; is a measure of the heat differential required for a semiconductor component to dissipate a given amount of power.</p>
<p>Discuss the nature of heat with your students: that a differential temperature (<span class="math">Δ <em>T</em></span>) is required for transfer of heat through a medium such as a solid. Compare this phenomenon with differences of electrical potential (<span class="math"><em>E</em></span>) and electric current (<span class="math"><em>I</em></span>). How do we express an electrical conductor’s ability to carry a moving charge under the influence of a potential difference?</p>
<p>Ask your students what difference it makes whether a semiconductor component has a high or a low thermal resistance. What is ideal for a semiconductor device, a high thermal resistance or a low thermal resistance? Why?</p>
