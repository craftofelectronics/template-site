<p>Calculate the load impedance &quot;seen&quot; by the source, through the ideal transformer with a winding turns ratio of 4:1.</p>

<p>Ask your students to describe the effect of the transformer’s step-up ratio on impedance magnitude and on impedance phase angle. They may do this by comparing the impedance of the C-R-C circuit on the transformer’s secondary side versus the impedance &quot;seen&quot; at the voltage source terminals. Ask them to explain why one of these parameters is affected but the other is not.</p>
<p>Then, pose the scenario of a real transformer, complete with leakage inductance. Ask your students to explain what effect would leakage inductance have on the load impedance of this circuit.</p>
