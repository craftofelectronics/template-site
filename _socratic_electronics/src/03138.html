<p>Suppose an engineer draws the following timing diagram for a time-delay relay circuit and then hands the diagram to a technician to figure out how to build it:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03138x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The technician, being well educated in the ways of time-delay relays, takes one look at this timing diagram and begins to laugh. Explain why this diagram is funny.</p>
<p>Time-delay relays can do a lot of neat things, but they cannot predict the future!</p>
<p>The real purpose of this question is to get students to recognize an impossibility in timing diagrams. As an instructor, I see students mistakes such as this once in a while. Those students who have trouble answering this question may not yet fully understand how to interpret timing diagrams!</p>
