<p>Explain what a <em>digital potentiometer</em> is, and give one example of a digital potentiometer in integrated-circuit (IC) form.</p>
<p>Analog Devices manufactures a 64-position digital potentiometer under the part number AD5227, for example. This is by no means the only digital potentiometer in production!</p>
<p>Follow-up question: would you classify a digital potentiometer as an ADC (analog-to-digital converter) or as a DAC (digital-to-analog converter)?</p>
<p>Rarely is the digital potentiometer mentioned in introductory textbooks as a digital-to-analog converter device, but it is!</p>
