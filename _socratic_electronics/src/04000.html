<p>When only the most significant bit (MSB) of an R-2R ladder resistor network is activated (all other bits inactive, their switches connecting to ground), the output voltage will be the same, regardless of how many bits the network has:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{04000x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Explain why this output voltage magnitude stands independent of the number of bits (sections) in the R-2R ladder network.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$V_{out} = {V_{ref} \over 2}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The key to understanding the answer is to apply Thévenin’s theorem to the &quot;inactive&quot; sections of the network. Here, the unique property of constant output impedance for an R-2R network yields a useful feature when applied to DAC circuitry.</p>
