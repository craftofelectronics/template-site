<p>A <em>logic probe</em> is a very useful tool for working with digital logic circuits. It indicates &quot;high&quot; and &quot;low&quot; logic states by means of LED’s, giving visual indication only if the voltage levels are appropriate for each state.</p>
<p>Here is a schematic diagram for a logic probe built using comparators. Each comparator has a threshold adjustment potentiometer, so that it may be set to indicate its respective logic state only if the signal voltage is well within the range stated by the logic manufacturer:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01275x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>When this logic probe circuit is connected to the <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>D</em><em>D</em></sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>S</em><em>S</em></sub></span> power supply terminals of a powered CMOS circuit, what voltage levels should test points TP1 and TP2 be adjusted to, in order for the probe to properly indicate &quot;high&quot; and &quot;low&quot; CMOS logic states? Consult a datasheet for the quad NAND gate numbered 4011. This is a legacy CMOS integrated circuit.</p>
<p>I’ll let you do your own research on this question. DO NOT obtain your answer from a textbook, but consult a manufacturer’s datasheet instead! You will find that the acceptable voltage levels vary with the power supply voltage, but that the <em>percentages</em> are rather constant.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: write a formula for calculating appropriate current-limiting resistor sizes for the two LEDs in this circuit, given the value of <span class="math"> + <em>V</em></span> and the LED forward voltage and current values.</p>
<p>Challenge question: the logic probe circuit shown is minimal in component count. To make a more practical and reliable probe, one would probably want to have reverse-polarity protection (in case someone were to accidently connect the probe backward across the power supply) as well as decoupling for immunity against electrical noise. Add whatever necessary components you think there should be in this circuit to provide these features.</p>
<p>The most obvious lesson of this question is to introduce (or review as the case may be) the purpose and operation of a logic probe. However, this question is also a veiled introduction (or review) of CMOS logic levels.</p>
