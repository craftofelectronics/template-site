<p>Suppose a student builds the following TRIAC circuit and finds that it does not work:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01091x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>When the pushbutton switch is actuated, nothing happens. What is wrong with this circuit? Hint: the problem in this circuit is very subtle, and may be very difficult to discern.</p>
<p>Terminals MT1 and MT2 on the TRIAC need to be reversed, like this:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01091x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>This aspect of TRIACs is often omitted from texts on thyristor devices, but it is important for students to understand. Even though TRIACs are bilateral devices, it still <em>does</em> matter where the triggering voltage is applied (between Gate and MT1, versus Gate and MT2).</p>
