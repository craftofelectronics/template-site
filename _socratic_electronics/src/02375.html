<p><em>Overload heaters</em> are special overcurrent protection devices commonly used in electric motor control circuits. Explain how overload heaters perform a function similar to that of <em>fuses</em>, and also explain how overload heaters differ from fuses. In other words, identify both the similarities and dis-similarities between overload heaters and fuses.</p>
<p>Like fuses, overload heaters protect elements in the circuit from damage resulting from excessive current. Unlike fuses, they are designed to thermally mimic like the motor itself, specifically protecting the motor rather than the wiring as fuses are generally sized to do.</p>
