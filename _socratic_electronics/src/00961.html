<p>The voltage gain of this amplifier circuit, unlike other amplifier configurations, is completely independent of the load resistor value:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00961x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>No matter what the resistance of the load, the amplifier’s voltage gain remains the same. Explain why this is so.</p>
<p>I’ll let you determine the answer to this question on your own!</p>
<p>I have found it helpful to approach this amplifier circuit from the perspective of a constant DC input voltage, qualitatively analyzing the voltage across the load resistor as it increases from a power-up condition. Students will see that the transistor goes into cutoff mode if the load voltage ever exceeds the total DC input voltage at the transistor’s base terminal, and will saturate if the load voltage ever falls below <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>i</em><em>n</em></sub></span> - 0.7 volts.</p>
