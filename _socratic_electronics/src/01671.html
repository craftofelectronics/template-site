<p>Plot the magnetic flux (<span class="math">Φ </span>) over time in the core of an ideal transformer, given a square-wave voltage applied to the primary winding:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01671x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Hint: The output voltage (measured at the secondary winding) will also be a square wave, perfectly in-phase with the source (primary) voltage.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01671x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Have students relate the equation <span class="math">$E_{L} = N {d \phi \over dt}$</span> to this problem, discussing the flux wave-shape in terms of rate-of-change over time.</p>
