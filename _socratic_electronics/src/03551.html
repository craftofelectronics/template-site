<p>Suppose a capacitor is charged to a voltage of exactly 100 volts, then connected to a resistor so it discharges slowly. Calculate the amount of voltage remaining across the capacitor terminals at the following points in time:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> 1 time constant (<span class="math"><em>τ</em></span>) after connecting the resistor:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> 2 time constants (2<span class="math"><em>τ</em></span>) after connecting the resistor:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> 3 time constants (3<span class="math"><em>τ</em></span>) after connecting the resistor:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> 4 time constants (4<span class="math"><em>τ</em></span>) after connecting the resistor:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> 5 time constants (5<span class="math"><em>τ</em></span>) after connecting the resistor:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> 1 time constant (<span class="math"><em>τ</em></span>) after connecting the resistor: <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>C</em></sub></span> = 36.79 volts</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> 2 time constants (2<span class="math"><em>τ</em></span>) after connecting the resistor: <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>C</em></sub></span> = 13.53 volts</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> 3 time constants (3<span class="math"><em>τ</em></span>) after connecting the resistor: <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>C</em></sub></span> = 4.979 volts</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> 4 time constants (4<span class="math"><em>τ</em></span>) after connecting the resistor: <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>C</em></sub></span> = 1.832 volts</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> 5 time constants (5<span class="math"><em>τ</em></span>) after connecting the resistor: <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>C</em></sub></span> = 0.6738 volts</p>
<p>Follow-up question: write an equation solving for these voltages at the specified times.</p>
<p>Although students should be able to look up approximate answers to this question from almost any beginning electronics textbook, the point here is to get them to relate the question to an actual formula so they may calculate this on their own.</p>
