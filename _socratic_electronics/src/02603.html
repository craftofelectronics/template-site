<p>It strikes some students as odd that opamps would have a constant slew rate. That is, when subjected to a step-change input voltage, an opamp’s output voltage would quickly ramp <em>linearly</em> over time, rather than ramp in some other way (such as the inverse exponential curve seen in RC and RL pulse circuits):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02603x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Yet, this effect has a definite cause, and it is found in the design of the opamp’s internal circuitry: the voltage multiplication stages within operational amplifier circuits often use <em>active loading</em> for increased voltage gain. An example of active loading may be seen in the following schematic diagram for the classic 741 opamp, where transistor <span class="math"><em>Q</em><sub>9</sub></span> acts as an active load for transistor <span class="math"><em>Q</em><sub>10</sub></span>, and where transistor <span class="math"><em>Q</em><sub>13</sub></span> provides an active load for transistor <span class="math"><em>Q</em><sub>17</sub></span>:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02603x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Explain how active loading creates the constant slew rate exhibited by operational amplifier circuits such as the 741. What factors account for the <em>linear</em> ramping of voltage over time?</p>
<p>Active loads act as constant-current sources feeding a constant (maximum) current through any capacitances in their way. This leads to constant <span class="math">${dv \over dt}$</span> rates according to the &quot;Ohm’s Law&quot; equation for capacitors:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$i = C {dv \over dt}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Follow-up question: based on what you see here, determine what parameters could be changed within the internal circuitry of an operational amplifier to increase the slew rate.</p>
<p>This question provides good review of fundamental capacitor behavior, and also explains <em>why</em> opamps have slew rates as they do.</p>
