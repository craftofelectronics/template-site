<p>What is magnetic <em>saturation</em>?</p>
<p>Magnetic &quot;saturation&quot; is what happens when the magnetic flux (<span class="math">Φ </span>, or flux density <span class="math"><em>B</em></span>) fails to increase in the same proportion to increases in magnetic field force (<span class="math">${\cal F}$</span>, or field intensity <span class="math"><em>H</em></span>) that it did at lower levels of <span class="math">$\cal F$</span> or <span class="math"><em>H</em></span>.</p>
<p>To use an economic phrase, saturation is a case of <em>diminishing returns</em>: where further increases in one variable yield smaller and smaller gains in another variable. It is important that students recognize the word &quot;saturation&quot; is used to describe phenomena other than magnetism, as well. But in any context it is used, the &quot;diminishing returns&quot; concept is the same.</p>
