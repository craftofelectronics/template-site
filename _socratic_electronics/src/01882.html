<p>Calculate the primary winding current (magnitude and phase angle) for this unloaded isolation transformer, with primary and secondary inductances of 18 Henrys each:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01882x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Assume the winding inductances are &quot;pure&quot; (no resistive components).</p>
<p><span class="math">$I_{primary} = 17.68 \hbox{ mA} \&gt; \angle -90^o$</span></p>
<p>Challenge question: what changes, if any, would result in the primary current value is this were not an isolation transformer, but rather a transformer where the secondary inductance was something other than 18 H?</p>
<p>Students should realize from the answer that an unloaded transformer simply appears as an inductor to the source.</p>
