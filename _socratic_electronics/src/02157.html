<p>How is pulse-width modulation power control similar to the form of control exerted by TRIACs and SCRs in AC power circuits? How does it differ?</p>
<p>As in PWM, AC power control circuits using TRIAC and SCR devices modulate power by controlling the amount of <em>time</em> the load receives power from the source.</p>
<p>Discuss with your students the similarities and differences between these two forms of time-based power control. Of course, PWM is more sophisticated than naturally-commutated SCR and TRIAC control schemes, but it is also more complex and therefore possibly more prone to faults.</p>
