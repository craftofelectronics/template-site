<p>Use circuit simulation software to verify your predicted and measured parameter values.</p>
<p>Students need not measure potentiometer shaft angles in order to do this exercise. Rather, all they need to do is measure resistance between the wiper and the two outer terminals to set the potentiometer to a position where it will produce the specified division of voltage.</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>p</em><em>o</em><em>t</em></sub></span> refers to the potentiometer’s nominal full-range value (for example, 1 k<span class="math">Ω </span> or 5 k<span class="math">Ω </span>), and not to its particular setting. The setting is what the student must figure out to achieve <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>o</em><em>u</em><em>t</em></sub></span>.</p>
<p>An extension of this exercise is to incorporate troubleshooting questions. Whether using this exercise as a performance assessment or simply as a concept-building lab, you might want to follow up your students’ results by asking them to predict the consequences of certain circuit faults.</p>
