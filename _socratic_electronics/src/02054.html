<p>A <em>field-effect transistor</em> is made from a continuous &quot;channel&quot; of doped semiconductor material, either N or P type. In the illustration shown below, the channel is N-type:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02054x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Trace the direction of current through the channel if a voltage is applied across the length as shown in the next illustration. Determine what type of charge carriers (electrons or holes) constitute the majority of the channel current:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02054x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The next step in the fabrication of a field-effect transistor is to implant regions of oppositely-doped semiconductor on either side of the channel as shown in the next illustration. These two regions are connected together by wire, and called the &quot;gate&quot; of the transistor:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02054x03.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Show how the presence of these &quot;gate&quot; regions in the channel influence the flow of charge carriers. Use small arrows if necessary to show how the charge carriers move through the channel and past the gate regions of the transistor. Finally, label which terminal of the transistor is the <em>source</em> and which terminal is the <em>drain</em>, based on the type of majority charge carrier present in the channel and the direction of those charge carriers’ motion.</p>
<p>The majority charge carriers in this transistor’s channel are electrons, not holes. Thus, the arrows drawn in the following diagrams point in the direction of electron flow:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02054x04.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>This makes the right-hand terminal the <em>source</em> and the left-hand terminal the <em>drain</em>.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: explain why the charge carriers avoid traversing the PN junctions formed by the gate-channel interfaces. In other words, explain why we do <em>not</em> see this happening:</p>

<p>Students typically find junction field-effect transistors much easier to understand than bipolar junction transistors, because there is less understanding of energy levels required to grasp the operation of JFETs than what is required to comprehend the operation of BJTs. Still, students need to understand how different charge carriers move through N- and P-type semiconductors, and what the significance of a depletion region is.</p>
