<p>Use circuit simulation software to verify your predicted and measured parameter values.</p>
<p>Use a variable-voltage, regulated power supply to supply any amount of DC voltage below 30 volts. Specify a standard resistor value, somewhere between 1 k<span class="math">Ω </span> and 100 k<span class="math">Ω </span> (1k5, 2k2, 2k7, 3k3, 4k7, 5k1, 6k8, 10k, 22k, 33k, 39k 47k, 68k, etc.).</p>
<p>An interesting &quot;twist&quot; on this exercise is to specify the value of resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> in colors. For example: Red, Vio, Red, Gld instead of 2.7 k<span class="math">Ω </span>.</p>
<p>When students set their power supplies for a certain amount of current, it is often helpful to have them do so while it is powering the resistor (rather than connecting their ammeter directly across the power supply to set its current output). This helps avoid the possibility of blowing the fuse in their ammeter!</p>
