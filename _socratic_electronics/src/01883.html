<p>Calculate the primary winding current (magnitude and phase angle) for this resistively loaded isolation transformer, with primary and secondary inductances of 18 Henrys each:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01883x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Also, draw an equivalent schematic diagram (with no transformer in it) illustrating the impedance &quot;seen&quot; by the AC power source. Assume no winding resistance in either transformer winding, and a magnetic coupling coefficient between the two windings of exactly 1.</p>

<p>Follow-up question: what kind of impedance (predominantly resistive, inductive, or capacitive) does the AC source &quot;see&quot; in this circuit? Contrast this against a situation with no load connected to the transformer at all.</p>
<p>This question illustrates how reflected load impedance is &quot;seen&quot; by the source, and how it interacts with the transformerâ€™s intrinsic winding impedance.</p>
