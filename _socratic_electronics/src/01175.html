<p>Determine the output voltage of this circuit for the following input voltage conditions:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math">$V_1 = +2 \hbox{ volts}$</span></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math">$V_3 = -1.5 \hbox{ volts}$</span></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math">$V_1 = +2.2 \hbox{ volts}$</span></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01175x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Hint: if you find this circuit too complex to analyze all at once, think of a way to simplify it so that you may analyze it one &quot;piece&quot; at a time.</p>
<p>The output voltage will be +2.2 volts, precisely.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: what function does this circuit perform? Can you think of any practical applications for it?</p>
<p>Another facet of this question to ponder with your students is the simplification process, especially for those students who experience difficulty analyzing the whole circuit. What simplification methods did your students think of when they approached this problem? What conclusions may be drawn about the general concept of problem simplification (as a problem-solving technique)?</p>
