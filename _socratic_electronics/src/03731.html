<p>Predict how the operation of this AC lamp dimmer circuit will be affected as a result of the following faults. Consider each fault independently (i.e. one at a time, no multiple faults):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03731x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Potentiometer <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>p</em><em>o</em><em>t</em></sub></span> fails open:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Capacitor <span class="math"><em>C</em><sub>1</sub></span> fails shorted:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Capacitor <span class="math"><em>C</em><sub>1</sub></span> fails open:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> DIAC fails open:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> TRIAC fails shorted:</p>
<p>For each of these conditions, explain <em>why</em> the resulting effects will occur.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Potentiometer <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>p</em><em>o</em><em>t</em></sub></span> fails open: <em>Lamp remains off.</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Capacitor <span class="math"><em>C</em><sub>1</sub></span> fails shorted: <em>Lamp remains off.</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Capacitor <span class="math"><em>C</em><sub>1</sub></span> fails open: <em>Range of lamp brightness control extends from 100% to 50%, and any attempt to make it dimmer results in the lamp just turning all the way off.</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> DIAC fails open: <em>Lamp remains off.</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> TRIAC fails shorted: <em>Lamp remains on at 100% brightness.</em></p>
<p>The purpose of this question is to approach the domain of circuit troubleshooting from a perspective of knowing what the fault is, rather than only knowing what the symptoms are. Although this is not necessarily a realistic perspective, it helps students build the foundational knowledge necessary to diagnose a faulted circuit from empirical data. Questions such as this should be followed (eventually) by other questions asking students to identify likely faults based on measurements.</p>
