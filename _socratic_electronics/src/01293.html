<p>Discuss with students the fact that relay coils and contacts need not be located near each other in ladder diagrams. While this may be confusing at times, it is a very flexible feature of ladder logic notation, because it gives the author the freedom to locate relay contacts where it makes the most visual sense in the &quot;output&quot; rung of the diagram, without having to coordinate locations of coil and contact as is generally necessary in traditional schematic diagrams. Instead, relay contacts are associated with their respective coils <em>by label</em>, not by proximity on the diagram.</p>
