<p>This heavy-duty battery test circuit seems to have a problem. Instead of the voltmeter drooping when the test switch is closed, it remains steady regardless of switch state. This happens even when the battery under test is known to be weak:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03941x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Other clues to the problem include the fact that rheostat setting seems to make no difference in the voltmeterâ€™s indication, and also that the cooling fan motor does not come on when the switch is pressed.</p>
<p>Identify possible faults in this circuit that could account for the symptoms listed here. Also, explain <em>why</em> each of your proposed faults would cause the observed symptoms.</p>
<p>Possible faults include broken wires or open connections at the following points in the circuit (marked with &quot;X&quot;):</p>

<p>Note: there is one more fault possibility that I have not listed here!</p>
<p>Discuss this simple circuit with your students, asking them how they diagnosed the problem and what possible faults could account for it. Encourage them to explore more than one possibility in their diagnoses!</p>
<p>In case a student happens to ask what the cooling fan is there for, tell them that it is there to provide cooling to the rheostat when in use.</p>
