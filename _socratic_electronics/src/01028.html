<p>What determines the color of an LED?</p>
<p>The type of semiconductor materials used to make the PN junction determine the color of light emitted.</p>
<p>Challenge question: describe the relationship between LED color and typical forward voltage, in terms of photon frequency, energy, and semiconductor band gap.</p>
<p>Ask your students to identify some common LED materials and colors, and of course cite their sources as they do. The challenge question may be readily answered through experimentation with different LED colors, although a physics-based explanation will take some additional research. This kind of experiment is very easy to conduct in class, together.</p>
<p>If time permits, you might wish to mention Albert Einstein’s contribution to this aspect of physics: his formulation for the energy carried by a photon (a <em>quantum</em>) of light:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math"><em>E</em> = <em>h</em><em>f</em></span><br /></p>
<p>Where,</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>E</em></span> = Energy carried by photon, in Joules</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>h</em></span> = Planck’s constant, 6.63 <span class="math"> × </span> 10<span class="math">$^{-34}$</span> J<span class="math"> ⋅ </span>s</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>f</em></span> = Frequency of light, in Hertz (<span class="math">$1 \over s$</span>)</p>
<p>Typical frequencies for visible light colors range from <span class="math">4 × 10<sup>14</sup></span> Hz for red, to <span class="math">7. 5 × 10<sup>14</sup></span> Hz for violet.</p>
