<p>The following lamp circuit has a problem. The lamp refuses to turn on, no matter what position the switch is set in:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03338x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>With the switch in the <em>on</em> position, you measure normal battery voltage between terminals <strong>1</strong> and <strong>4</strong> on the terminal block. Based on this information, identify which of these proposed faults could possibly account for the observed behavior of this circuit and which could not. Consider each fault one at a time (in other words, ask yourself whether or not each proposed fault – by itself – could account for the behavior of the circuit):</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Lamp failed open (filament broken in half) – <em>possible</em> or <em>not possible</em>?</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Broken wire between lamp and switch – <em>possible</em> or <em>not possible</em>?</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Broken wire between switch and terminal block – <em>possible</em> or <em>not possible</em>?</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Completely dead battery – <em>possible</em> or <em>not possible</em>?</p>
