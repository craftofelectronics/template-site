<p>An amplifier has a voltage gain of 5 and a current gain of 75, both figures being ratios. Calculate the following gains:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Power gain (as a ratio)</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Power gain (dB)</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Voltage gain (dB)</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Current gain (dB)</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Power gain (as a ratio) = 375</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Power gain (dB) = 25.74 dB</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Voltage gain (dB) = 13.98 dB</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Current gain (dB) = 37.50 dB</p>
<p>Some of your students will probably get the power calculations correct, but be off by a factor of two on the voltage and current gain (dB) calculations. Remind them that a different equation is used to calculate voltage and current gain in dB than is used in power calculations.</p>
