<p>Suppose you needed a resistance equal to precisely 235 <span class="math">Ω </span> for the construction of a precision electrical meter circuit. The only resistors available to you are two 1 k<span class="math">Ω </span> resistors, one 500 <span class="math">Ω </span> resistor, and a rheostat variable between 600 and 1000 ohms. Design a parallel resistor network using any combination of these components that will yield a total resistance of 235 <span class="math">Ω </span>. If you use the rheostat in your design, specify its resistance setting.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00335x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>This problem is an exercise in estimation, and algebraic equation manipulation. Estimation will reveal which resistors should be combined together, and algebraic manipulation will give the exact values needed.</p>
