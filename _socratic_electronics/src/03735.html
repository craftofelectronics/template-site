<p>Predict how all component voltages and currents in this circuit will be affected as a result of the following faults. Consider each fault independently (i.e. one at a time, no multiple faults):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03735x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> fails open:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Transistor <span class="math"><em>Q</em><sub>1</sub></span> fails open, collector to emitter:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Transistor <span class="math"><em>Q</em><sub>1</sub></span> fails shorted, collector to emitter:</p>

<p><span class="math"> • </span> Load fails shorted:</p>
<p>For each of these conditions, explain <em>why</em> the resulting effects will occur.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> fails open: <em>No current through <span class="math"><em>Q</em><sub>1</sub></span>, no current through <span class="math"><em>Q</em><sub>2</sub></span>, no current through load, no voltage dropped across <span class="math"><em>Q</em><sub>1</sub></span>, full voltage dropped across collector-emitter of <span class="math"><em>Q</em><sub>2</sub></span>.</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Transistor <span class="math"><em>Q</em><sub>1</sub></span> fails open, collector to emitter: <em>Approximately the same current through <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span>, increased current through <span class="math"><em>Q</em><sub>2</sub></span> base, increased current through <span class="math"><em>Q</em><sub>2</sub></span> collector (load current),and less voltage dropped between collector-emitter of <span class="math"><em>Q</em><sub>2</sub></span>.</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Transistor <span class="math"><em>Q</em><sub>1</sub></span> fails shorted, collector to emitter: <em>Increased current through <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span>, almost zero current through all terminals of <span class="math"><em>Q</em><sub>2</sub></span> and the load, full voltage dropped across collector-emitter of <span class="math"><em>Q</em><sub>2</sub></span>.</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Transistor <span class="math"><em>Q</em><sub>2</sub></span> fails open, collector to emitter: <em>No change in current for <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> or <span class="math"><em>Q</em><sub>1</sub></span>, zero load current, full voltage dropped across collector-emitter of <span class="math"><em>Q</em><sub>2</sub></span>.</em></p>

<p><span class="math"> • </span> Load fails shorted: <em>No change in any current (in reality, load current will slightly increase), increased voltage drop across collector-emitter of <span class="math"><em>Q</em><sub>2</sub></span>, possible overheating of <span class="math"><em>Q</em><sub>2</sub></span>.</em></p>
<p>The purpose of this question is to approach the domain of circuit troubleshooting from a perspective of knowing what the fault is, rather than only knowing what the symptoms are. Although this is not necessarily a realistic perspective, it helps students build the foundational knowledge necessary to diagnose a faulted circuit from empirical data. Questions such as this should be followed (eventually) by other questions asking students to identify likely faults based on measurements.</p>
