<p>Use circuit simulation software to verify your predicted and measured parameter values.</p>
<p>Here, students must calculate values for <span class="math"><em>C</em><sub>1</sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> that will produce the <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>o</em><em>u</em><em>t</em></sub></span> waveshape specified in the &quot;Given conditions&quot; oscilloscope plot. The input signal, of course, is a square wave. Students should be able to show mathematically why the time constant of the integrator (<span class="math"><em>τ</em></span>) must be 1.443 times the waveform’s half-period (<span class="math">$e^{-t \over \tau} = {1 \over 2}$</span>). Instructors, note: the calculations for this circuit, with <span class="math">$V_{out} = {1 \over 3}V_{in}$</span>, are exactly the same as for a 555 timer circuit, because 555 timers also cycle their capacitors’ voltages at peak-to-peak values equal to one-third of the supply voltage.</p>
<p>There are many different combinations of values for <span class="math"><em>C</em><sub>1</sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> possible for any given square-wave signal frequencies. The purpose of this exercise is for students to be able to predict and select practical component values from their parts kits.</p>
<p>An extension of this exercise is to incorporate troubleshooting questions. Whether using this exercise as a performance assessment or simply as a concept-building lab, you might want to follow up your students’ results by asking them to predict the consequences of certain circuit faults.</p>
