<p>The trigonometric function of <em>cosine</em> may be found as the result of an infinite series. Note that this series assumes the angle <span class="math"><em>x</em></span> to be expressed in units of <em>radians</em>, not degrees:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\cos x = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} (-1)^n {x^{2n} \over {(2n)!}}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Approximate the cosine of 1 radian (<span class="math">cos1</span>) in steps, using the following table, then write the partial sum expansion up to <span class="math"><em>n</em> = 5</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math"></span><br /><span class="math">$\vskip 30pt

\underbar{file 04056}$</span><br /><span class="math"></span></p>
<p>Shown here is the partial sum expansion up to <span class="math"><em>n</em> = 5</span>:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\cos x \approx 1 - {x^{2} \over 2!} + {x^{4} \over 4!} - {x^{6} \over 6!} + {x^{8} \over 8!} - {x^{10} \over 10!}$</span><br /></p>
<p>It should go without saying that students should consult their electronic calculators to see what the actual value of <span class="math">cos1</span> is, and compare that to their partial sum approximation. Students should also feel free to explore the validity of this series by approximating the cosine of angles other than 1 radian.</p>
<p>This questions provides students with the opportunity to see how <span class="math">cos<em>x</em></span> may be arithmetically calculated. This, in fact, is how many digital electronic computers determine trigonometric functions: from partial sum approximations.</p>
