<p>There really isn’t much you can do to verify your experimental results. That’s okay, though, because the results are qualitative anyway.</p>
<p>If the oscilloscope does not have its own internal square-wave signal source, use a function generator set up to output square waves at 1 volt peak-to-peak at a frequency of 1 kHz.</p>
<p>If this is not the first time students have done this, be sure to &quot;mess up&quot; the oscilloscope controls prior to them making adjustments. Students <em>must</em> learn how to quickly configure an oscilloscope’s controls to display any arbitrary waveform, if they are to be proficient in using an oscilloscope as a diagnostic tool.</p>
