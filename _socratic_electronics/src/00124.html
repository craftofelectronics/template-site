<p>Suppose this battery and light bulb circuit failed to work:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00124x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Using a voltmeter, a technician measures full battery voltage between the points C and H. The result of this single measurement indicates which half of the circuit there is a definite problem in. What would you recommend as the <em>next</em> voltmeter measurement to take in troubleshooting the circuit, following the same &quot;divide in half&quot; strategy?</p>
<p>To &quot;divide the circuit in half&quot; again, measure voltage between points D and I.</p>
<p>Some troubleshooters refer to this strategy as &quot;divide and conquer,&quot; because it divides the possibilities of fault location by a factor of 2 with each step. Make sure your students understand that being able to immediately determine which part of a system is <em>not</em> faulted is a valuable time-saver.</p>
