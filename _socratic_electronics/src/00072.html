<p>What is the difference between materials classified as <em>conductors</em> versus those classified as <em>insulators</em>, in the electrical sense of these words?</p>
<p>Electrical &quot;conductors&quot; offer easy passage of electric current through them, while electrical &quot;insulators&quot; do not. The fundamental difference between an electrical &quot;conductor&quot; and an electrical &quot;insulator&quot; is how readily electrons may drift away from their respective atoms.</p>
<p>For an illustration of electron mobility within a metallic substance, research the terms <em>electron gas</em> and <em>&quot;sea of electrons&quot;</em> in a chemistry reference book.</p>
<p>It is important to realize that electrical &quot;conductors&quot; and &quot;insulators&quot; are not the same as thermal &quot;conductors&quot; and &quot;insulators.&quot; Materials that are insulators in the electrical sense may be fair conductors of heat (certain silicone gels used as heat-transfer fluids for heat sinks, for instance). Materials that are conductors in the electrical sense may be fair insulators in the thermal sense (conductive plastics, for example).</p>
