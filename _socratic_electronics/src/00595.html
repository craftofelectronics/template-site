<p>Both soldering <em>irons</em> and soldering <em>guns</em> are tools used in the process of electrical soldering. Describe what each of these tools looks like, and how they function.</p>
<p>A modern soldering &quot;iron&quot; is a pencil-shaped device with an electrical heating element in its end. Soldering &quot;guns&quot; have a pistol-shaped body, with a loop of thick copper wire at the end acting directly as a heating element. Soldering irons have no on/off switch, while soldering guns do, which should tell you something about the speed at which they heat.</p>
<p>Antique soldering irons were really nothing more than iron wedges with wooden handles, which were set directly in a fire for heat, much like clothes irons used to be nothing more than an anvil-shaped mass of iron that was set on top of a hot stove for heat. Iâ€™ve used one of these old soldering irons to solder sheet metal pieces together, and the technique of use was exactly the same as it is for a modern (electric) soldering iron.</p>
<p>If you have soldering irons and guns available in your classroom, show them to your students during discussion.</p>
