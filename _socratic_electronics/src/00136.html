<p>Some communications networks use cables to not only provide a path for data transmission, but also DC power to energize the circuits connected to the cable.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00136x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>However, if we were to terminate the cable as shown, the termination resistor would dissipate a substantial amount of power. This is wasted energy, and would unnecessarily burden the power supply providing DC power to the network cable.</p>
<p>How can we eliminate the problem of power dissipated by the termination resistor in a DC power/signal cable and yet still maintain proper termination to avoid reflected signals?</p>
<p>A capacitor must be connected in series with the termination resistance to prevent the resistance from acting as a DC load on the network:</p>

<p>Understanding this answer requires that students recall the filtering behavior of a series capacitor in an AC circuit.</p>
