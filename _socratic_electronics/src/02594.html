<p>In a common-emitter transistor amplifier circuit, the presence of capacitance between the collector and base terminals – whether intrinsic to the transistor or externally connected – has the effect of turning the amplifier circuit into a low-pass filter, with voltage gain being inversely proportional to frequency:</p>

<p>Explain why this is. Why, exactly, does a capacitance placed in this location affect voltage gain? Hint: it has something to do with <em>negative feedback</em>!</p>
<p>The capacitance provides a path for an AC feedback signal to go from the collector to the base. Given the inverting phase relationship between collector voltage and base voltage, this feedback is degenerative.</p>
<p>Students should realize that this is no hypothetical question. Intrinsic capacitance does indeed exist between the collector and base of a bipolar junction transistor (called the <em>Miller capacitance</em>), and this has a degenerating effect on voltage gain with increasing frequency. If time permits, you may wish to discuss how the common-collector and common-base amplifier configurations naturally avoid this problem.</p>
