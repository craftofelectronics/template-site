<p>Suppose a few turns of wire within the inductor in this filter circuit suddenly became short-circuited, so that the inductor effectively has fewer turns of wire than it did before:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03505x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>What sort of effect would this fault have on the filtering action of this circuit?</p>
<p>The resonant frequency of the circuit would <em>increase</em>.</p>
<p>Challenge question: what would happen to the <span class="math"><em>Q</em></span> of this filter circuit as a result of the fault within the inductor?</p>
<p>Determining the effect on resonant frequency is a simple matter of qualitative analysis with the resonant frequency formula. The effect on Q (challenge question) may be answered just as easily if the students know the formula relating bandwidth to <span class="math"><em>L</em></span>, <span class="math"><em>C</em></span>, and <span class="math"><em>R</em></span>.</p>
