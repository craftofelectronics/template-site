<p>A length of copper wire (<span class="math"><em>α</em> = 0. 004041</span> at 20<span class="math">$^{o}$</span> C) has a resistance of 5 ohms at 20 degrees Celsius. Calculate its resistance if the temperature were to increase to 50 degrees Celsius.</p>
<p>Now, take that calculated resistance, and that new temperature of 50<span class="math">$^{o}$</span> C, and calculate what the resistance of the wire should go to if it cools back down to 20<span class="math">$^{o}$</span> C. Treat this as a separate problem, working through all the calculations, and don’t just say &quot;5 ohms&quot; because you know the original conditions!</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>50<sup><em>o</em></sup><em>C</em></sub> = 5. 606 Ω </span></p>
<p>If you got an answer of <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>20<sup><em>o</em></sup><em>C</em></sub> = 4. 927 Ω </span> for the second calculation, you made a common mistake that is not always warned against in textbooks! Try the math again. If you got the proper answer of <span class="math">5 Ω </span> upon doing the second calculation, try to figure out why someone may have calculated <span class="math">4. 927 Ω </span> taking the temperature from 50<span class="math">$^{o}$</span> C down to 20<span class="math">$^{o}$</span> C.</p>
<p>One thing students need to learn is they can’t simply use the resistance-temperature formula as it is normally given if the &quot;reference&quot; (starting) temperature is not the same as the temperature at which <span class="math"><em>α</em></span> is specified at!</p>
