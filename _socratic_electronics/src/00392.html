<p>Suppose we were planning to use a photovoltaic panel to generate electricity and electrolyze water into hydrogen and oxygen gas:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00392x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Our goal is to electrolyze as much water as possible, and this means we must maximize the electrolysis cell’s power dissipation. Explain how we could experimentally determine the optimum internal resistance of the electrolysis cell, prior to actually building it, using nothing but the solar panel, a rheostat, and a DMM (digital multimeter).</p>
<p>Experimentally determine what amount load resistance drops exactly one-half of the panel’s open-circuit voltage.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: assuming that the open-circuit voltage of this solar panel were high enough to pose a shock hazard, describe a procedure you might use to safely connect a &quot;test load&quot; to the panel.</p>
<p>Students should at this point understand the maximum power transfer theorem, and also the concept of a voltage source having a certain amount of internal resistance. The &quot;trick&quot; of this question is, of course, how to determine the panel’s internal resistance. Do not be surprised if a student suggests using the meter to measure the panel’s resistance directly (though this will not work with a real photovoltaic panel).</p>
<p>Regarding the safety-oriented follow-up question, you might want to ask your students what the commonly accepted &quot;shock hazard&quot; voltage level is (30 volts).</p>
