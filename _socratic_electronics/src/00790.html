<p>A student learns that a rectifier circuit is often followed by a <em>low-pass filter</em> circuit in an AC-DC power supply to reduce &quot;ripple&quot; voltage on the output. Looking over his notes from AC theory, the student proceeds to build this power supply circuit complete with a low-pass filter at the output:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00790x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>While this design will work, there are better filter configurations for this application. Describe the limitations of the circuit shown, and explain how some of the other filters would do a better job.</p>
<p>The resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em></span> tends to limit the output current, resulting in less-than-optimal voltage regulation (the output voltage &quot;sagging&quot; under load). Better filter configurations include all forms of LC ripple filters, including the popular &quot;pi&quot; (<span class="math"><em>π</em></span>) filter.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: in some applications – especially where very large filter capacitors are used – it is a <em>good</em> idea to place a series resistor before the capacitor. Such a resistor is typically rated at a low value so as to not cause excessive output voltage &quot;sag&quot; under load, but its resistance does serve a practical purpose. Explain what this purpose might be.</p>
<p>Challenge your students with this question: is this the right kind of filter circuit (low pass, high pass, band pass, band stop) to be using, anyway? This question presents a good opportunity to review basic filter theory.</p>
<p>The follow-up question asks students to think carefully about the possible positive benefits of having a series resistor before the capacitor as shown in the student’s original design. If your students are experiencing difficulty understanding why a resistor would ever be necessary, jog their memories with this formula:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$i = C {dv \over dt}$</span><br /></p>
