<p>One of the &quot;rules&quot; we apply to operational amplifier circuits with negative feedback regards the differential input voltage:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02713x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Explain what this rule is. How much differential voltage do we typically have on an operational amplifier when negative feedback is in effect?</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>d</em><em>i</em><em>f</em><em>f</em></sub></span> = 0 volts</p>
