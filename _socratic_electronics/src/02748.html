<p>Follow-up question: what design constraints will dictate the sizes of the resistors and capacitors?</p>
<p>This simple filtered voltage divider circuit works well when the current draws are low, or at least very close to being equal, on the +V and -V load rails. It does not work so well for highly asymmetrical loads, or where low quiescent current draw is important (low-power battery circuits, for example). In applications requiring better +V/-V voltage stability, an opamp &quot;follower&quot; circuit is recommended after the voltage divider.</p>
