<p>An LR differentiator circuit is used to convert a triangle wave into a square wave. One day after years of proper operation, the circuit fails. Instead of outputting a square wave, it outputs a triangle wave, just the same as the waveform measured at the circuitâ€™s input. Determine what the most likely component failure is in the circuit.</p>
<p>The inductor is failed open.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: this is not the only possible failure, but it is the most likely. Explain what the other failure(s) could be, and also why the one given here is most likely.</p>
<p>There are only two components in this circuit, so determining possible failures should not be a problem at all. To distinguish between the inductor having failed versus the resistor having failed, one needs to know which type of component failures are more likely (and why!).</p>
