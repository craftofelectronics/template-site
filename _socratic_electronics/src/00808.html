<p>Challenge question: if a resistor were connected between the ends of this wire loop, would it &quot;see&quot; direct current (DC), or alternating current (AC)?</p>
<p>Note that the two wire ends switch polarity as the loop rotates. Ask your students to explain why the polarities are as they are.</p>
