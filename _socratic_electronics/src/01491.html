<p>What resistor values will you choose for the &quot;dropping&quot; resistors in series with the light-emitting diodes? Remember that these resistor values will depend on the voltage and current ratings of the diodes, as well as the chosen power supply voltages.</p>
<p>This may be determined by using Ohm’s Law, once the component ratings and operating voltage are known.</p>
<p>This is a very practical application of Ohm’s Law, in a context simple enough for beginning students to understand.</p>
