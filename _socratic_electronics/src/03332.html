<p>A student builds the following voltage divider circuit so she can power a 6-volt lamp from a 15-volt power supply:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03332x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>When built, the circuit works just as it should. However, after operating successfully for hours, the lamp suddenly goes dark. Identify all the possible faults you can think of in this circuit which could account for the lamp not glowing anymore.</p>
<p>Here are a few possibilities (by no means exhaustive):</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Lamp burned out</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> 15-volt power supply failed</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Resistors <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> <em>and</em> <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span> simultaneously failed open</p>
<p>Follow-up question: although the third possibility mentioned here is certainly valid, it is less likely than any <em>single</em> failure. Explain why, and how this general principle of considering single faults first is a good rule to follow when troubleshooting systems.</p>
<p>Have fun with your students figuring out all the possible faults which could account for the lamp going dark! Be sure to include wires and wire connections in your list.</p>
<p>The follow-up question is intended to get students to come up with their own version of Occam’s Razor: the principle that the simplest explanation for an observed phenomenon is probably the correct one.</p>
