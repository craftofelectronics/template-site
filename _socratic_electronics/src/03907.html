<p>This Johnson counter circuit is special. It outputs three square-wave signals, shifted 120<span class="math">$^{o}$</span> from one another:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03907x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Suppose the middle flip-flopâ€™s <span class="math"><em>Q</em></span> output fails in the &quot;high&quot; state. Plot the new output waveforms for signals <strong>A</strong>, <strong>B</strong>, and <strong>C</strong>. Assume all <span class="math"><em>Q</em></span> outputs begin in the &quot;low&quot; state (except for the middle flip-flop, of course):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03907x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03907x03.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The purpose of this question is to approach the domain of circuit troubleshooting from a perspective of knowing what the fault is, rather than only knowing what the symptoms are. Although this is not necessarily a realistic perspective, it helps students build the foundational knowledge necessary to diagnose a faulted circuit from empirical data. Questions such as this should be followed (eventually) by other questions asking students to identify likely faults based on measurements.</p>
