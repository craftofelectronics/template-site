<p>Based on an analysis of a typical TTL logic gate circuit (consult a datasheet for a TTL logic gate if you need an internal schematic diagram for a gate circuit), determine what logic state is &quot;assumed&quot; by a TTL gate input when left &quot;floating&quot; (disconnected).</p>
<p>What ramification does this have for us when choosing input devices for TTL logic gates? If, for instance, we wished to use a single-pole, single-throw (SPST) switch as the input device for a TTL logic gate, what is the <em>best</em> way to connect such a device to a TTL input? Should the switch connect the TTL input to <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>C</em><em>C</em></sub></span> when closed, or should it connect the input to <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>E</em><em>E</em></sub></span> when closed? Why does it matter? Explain your answer in detail.</p>
<p>TTL input devices must be <em>current-sinking</em>: that is, they must <em>ground</em> the TTL gate input in one of their states. Iâ€™ll let you figure out why this is so, from the schematic diagrams of TTL logic gate circuits.</p>
<p>For review, ask your students what the symbols <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>C</em><em>C</em></sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>E</em><em>E</em></sub></span> mean with reference to TTL circuits.</p>
<p>Proper TTL &quot;etiquette&quot; is vitally important for students to understand, if they are to successfully build digital circuits (especially when interfacing TTL with other types of logic!).</p>
