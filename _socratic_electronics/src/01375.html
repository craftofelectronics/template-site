<p>Draw the schematic diagram for a four-bit binary &quot;up&quot; counter circuit, using J-K flip-flops.</p>
<p>The circuit shown here is not the only valid solution!</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01375x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Follow-up question: what <em>other</em> configuration of J-K flip-flops could be used to make a four bit binary &quot;up&quot; counter?</p>
<p>Be sure to discuss the follow-up question with your students. It is important that they understand how to make both &quot;up&quot; and &quot;down&quot; counters using J-K flip-flops, and that there are two basic methods to make each direction of counter.</p>
