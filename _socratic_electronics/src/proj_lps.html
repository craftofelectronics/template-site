<p>This circuit toggles a J-K flip-flop when it senses a <em>pulse</em> of light. Instead of a photocell or a solar cell, paralleled LEDs are used as the photo-detecting component. LEDs are typically much cheaper and more readily available than either photocells or solar cells, which is why I chose to use them here.</p>

<p>Of course, you are not restricted to using this exact design. One variation is to place a monostable 555 timer circuit at the output of the comparator instead of a J-K flip-flop. This would activate the output for a certain time period after detecting a pulse of light, rather than using one light pulse to turn the output on and another light pulse to turn the output off.</p>
<p>The potentiometer should be adjusted for good sensitivity in ambient light conditions. Obviously, the darker the ambient conditions, the more sensitive the circuit is to light pulses.</p>
<p>My original application for this circuit was a means to control an electronic display located inside a glass-fronted display case. By briefly pulsing a bright flashlight at the LED cluster, one could turn the display on and off through the glass with no pushbuttons or other contact-type interface devices.</p>
