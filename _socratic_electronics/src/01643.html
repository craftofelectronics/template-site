<p>The ohmmeter’s indication is the &quot;final word&quot; on resistance.</p>
<p>Use a variable-voltage, regulated power supply to supply any amount of DC voltage below 30 volts. Use precision resistors for <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span>, and use any standard resistor value for <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>x</em></sub></span> between 1 k<span class="math">Ω </span> and 100 k<span class="math">Ω </span>.</p>
<p>An extension of this exercise is to incorporate troubleshooting questions. Whether using this exercise as a performance assessment or simply as a concept-building lab, you might want to follow up your students’ results by asking them to predict the consequences of certain circuit faults.</p>
