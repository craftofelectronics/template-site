<p>What is a <em>harmonic</em> frequency? If an oscillator circuit outputs a fundamental frequency of 12 kHz, calculate the frequencies of the following harmonics:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> 1st harmonic =</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> 2nd harmonic =</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> 3rd harmonic =</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> 4th harmonic =</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> 5th harmonic =</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> 6th harmonic =</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> 1st harmonic = 12 kHz</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> 2nd harmonic = 24 kHz</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> 3rd harmonic = 36 kHz</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> 4th harmonic = 48 kHz</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> 5th harmonic = 60 kHz</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> 6th harmonic = 72 kHz</p>
<p>Ask your students to determine the mathematical relationship between harmonic number, harmonic frequency, and fundamental frequency. It isn’t difficult to figure out!</p>
