<p>Explain in your own words how to apply the <em>Superposition Theorem</em> to calculate the amount of current through the load resistor in this circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02035x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>To apply the Superposition Theorem to the analysis of <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>l</em><em>o</em><em>a</em><em>d</em></sub></span>’s current, you must consider each source acting alone, then algebraically combine the results of each analysis.</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>I</em><sub><em>l</em><em>o</em><em>a</em><em>d</em></sub> = </span> 6.623 mA</p>
<p>Here is a circuit students will not be able to analyze by series-parallel analysis, since it is impossible to reduce all the resistors in it to a single equivalent resistance. It is cases like this that really showcase the power of Superposition as an analysis technique.</p>
