<p>A two-conductor cable of uniform construction will exhibit a uniform <em>characteristic impedance</em> (<span class="math"><em>Z</em><sub>0</sub></span>) due to its intrinsic, distributed inductance and capacitance:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{04002x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>What would happen to the value of this characteristic impedance if we were to shorten the cable’s length, all other dimensions remaining the same?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{04002x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math"><em>Z</em><sub>0</sub></span> would remain exactly the same!</p>
<p>Follow-up question: what electrical characteristics <em>would</em> change for this shortened cable?</p>
<p>This is sort of a &quot;trick&quot; question, designed to make students <em>think</em> about characteristic impedance, and to test their real comprehension of it. If a student properly understands the physics resulting in characteristic impedance, they will realize length has nothing whatsoever to do with it. Although the cable’s total capacitance will change as a result of shortening the cable’s length, and the cable’s total inductance will likewise decrease for the same reason, these electrical changes should not present a conceptual difficulty to students unless they are modeling the cable in terms of <em>one</em> lumped capacitance and <em>one</em> (or two) lumped inductance(s). If they are thinking in these terms, they have not yet fully grasped the reason why characteristic impedance exists at all.</p>
