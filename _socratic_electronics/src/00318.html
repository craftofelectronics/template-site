<p>Explain why most electrical power systems have one of their current-carrying conductors connected to earth ground (&quot;grounded&quot;). Why not just leave all power conductors ungrounded? Would this not reduce electric shock hazard?</p>
<p>An ungrounded power system is <em>unpredictable</em> from the perspective of safety.</p>
<p>Be sure to discuss with your students the benefits and drawbacks of power system grounding. There are some instances where systems are left intentionally ungrounded because the safety benefit of grounding them is negligible (high-voltage power distribution systems may often be ungrounded for this reason). In low-voltage (120 volt) domestic power systems, though, grounding is <em>required</em> by law.</p>
