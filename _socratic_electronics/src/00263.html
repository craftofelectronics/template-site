<p>As an electric current is passed through a coil of wire, it creates a magnetic field. If the magnitude of this current changes over time, so will the strength of the magnetic field.</p>
<p>We also know that a magnetic field flux that changes over time will induce a voltage along the length of a wire coil. Explain how the complementary principles of electromagnetism and electromagnetic induction manifest themselves simultaneously in the same wire coil to produce <em>self-induction</em>.</p>
<p>Also, explain how Lenz’s Law relates to the polarity of the coil’s self-induced voltage.</p>
<p>A changing current through a coil produces a voltage drop that opposes the direction of change.</p>
<p>Self-induction is not a difficult concept to grasp if one already possesses a good understanding of electromagnetism, electromagnetic induction, and Lenz’s Law. Some students may struggle understanding self-induction, because it is probably the first application they’ve seen where these three phenomena inter-relate simultaneously.</p>
