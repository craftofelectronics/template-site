<p>Suppose you need a memory array with 2k <span class="math"> × </span> 4 organization, but all you have on hand are 1k <span class="math"> × </span> 4 memory chips. Show how you could connect two of them to form the desired array:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01447x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01447x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Follow-up question: which of the two memory chips shown here stores the first 1024 addresses, and which one stores the next 1024 addresses? How can you tell?</p>
<p>Challenge question: as you can see, the expansion in addresses comes at the expense of losing the ability to simultaneously disable <em>both</em> memory chips. Add whatever logic gates are necessary to this circuit to provide a &quot;global&quot; <span class="math">$\overline{CS}$</span> line for the 2k <span class="math"> × </span> 4 memory array.</p>
<p>Be sure to spend some time discussing the follow-up question. Once again, I’ve noticed students are prone to memorizing the connection pattern rather than take the time to figure out <em>why</em> the chips are connected as they are.</p>
