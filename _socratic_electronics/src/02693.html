<p>Identify the mathematical function of this circuit (if you look closely, youâ€™ll notice that the transistors are connected in such a way that they act very similar to diodes):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02693x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Note: the two resistors labeled &quot;R&quot; are equal in value.</p>
<p>This circuit takes the <em>square root</em> of the input signal (<span class="math">$y = \sqrt{x}$</span>).</p>
<p>Follow-up question: how could we modify this circuit so as to take the <em>cube root</em> of the input signal?</p>
<p>This circuit is not nearly as complex as it may appear at first, if students take the time to isolate it section-by-section and identify the mathematical function each section performs.</p>
