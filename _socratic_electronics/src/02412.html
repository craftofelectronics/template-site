<p>Identify each type of JFET (whether it is N-channel or P-channel), label the terminals, and determine whether the JFET in each of these circuits will be turned <em>on</em> or <em>off</em>:</p>

<p>Follow-up question: explain why the lower-right circuit has question-marks next to the transistor. Why is the JFET’s state uncertain?</p>
<p>It is very important for your students to understand what factor(s) in a circuit force a JFET to turn on or off. Be sure to ask your students to explain their reasoning for each transistor’s status. What factor, or combination of factors, is necessary to turn a JFET on, versus off? One point of this question is to emphasize the non-importance of <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>D</em><em>D</em></sub></span>’s polarity when there is an external biasing voltage applied directly between gate and source.</p>
