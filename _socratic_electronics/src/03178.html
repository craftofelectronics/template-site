<p>Use circuit simulation software to verify your predicted and measured parameter values.</p>
<p>I recommend a supply voltage of 12 volts, a potentiometer value of 10 k<span class="math">Ω </span>, a capacitor value of 0.1 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>F, and a loading resistor (<span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span>) of 1 M<span class="math">Ω </span>. Use a DMM so as to not load the circuit any more than necessary. If you wish to choose different capacitor/resistor values, I strongly suggest choosing them such that the time constant (<span class="math"><em>τ</em></span>) of the circuit significantly faster than 1 second.</p>
<p>An extension of this exercise is to incorporate troubleshooting questions. Whether using this exercise as a performance assessment or simply as a concept-building lab, you might want to follow up your students’ results by asking them to predict the consequences of certain circuit faults.</p>
