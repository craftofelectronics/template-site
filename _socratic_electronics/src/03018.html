<p>How do we define the &quot;toggle&quot; mode for a J-K flip-flop? In other words, what happens at the output (<span class="math"><em>Q</em></span> and <span class="math">$\overline{Q}$</span>) during the toggle mode that is different from any of the other modes for this flip-flop?</p>
<p>In the <em>toggle</em> mode, <span class="math"><em>Q</em></span> and <span class="math">$\overline{Q}$</span> swap states, going from set to reset or from reset to set.</p>
