<p>This interesting bridge circuit is a variable phase-shifter. It works best when the excitation frequency is such that <span class="math"><em>X</em><sub><em>C</em></sub> = <em>R</em></span> in each arm of the bridge:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01599x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Supposing that <span class="math"><em>X</em><sub><em>C</em></sub></span> does equal <span class="math"><em>R</em></span> in each arm of the bridge, and that the potentiometer resistance is sufficiently high to limit current through it to a negligible level (in other words, <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>p</em><em>o</em><em>t</em></sub> &gt;  &gt; <em>R</em></span>). Calculate the phase shift of <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>o</em><em>u</em><em>t</em></sub></span> with respect to the excitation source voltage when:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> The potentiometer wiper is fully left:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> The potentiometer wiper is fully right:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> The potentiometer wiper is perfectly centered:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> The potentiometer wiper is fully left: <span class="math">Θ  =  − 45<sup><em>o</em></sup></span></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> The potentiometer wiper is fully right: <span class="math">Θ  = 45<sup><em>o</em></sup></span></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> The potentiometer wiper is perfectly centered: <span class="math">Θ  = 0<sup><em>o</em></sup></span></p>
<p>Follow-up question: this circuit works best with the excitation frequency is such that <span class="math"><em>X</em><sub><em>C</em></sub> = <em>R</em></span>. Write a formula that solves for the necessary frequency (<span class="math"><em>f</em></span>) to achieve this condition given a certain value of <span class="math"><em>R</em></span>.</p>
<p>This is a very interesting circuit to built and test. You may build one using 1 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>F capacitors, 2.7 k<span class="math">Ω </span> resistors, and a 100 k<span class="math">Ω </span> potentiometer that will successfully operate on 60 Hz power-line excitation.</p>
<p>An interesting thing to note about using line power is that any distortions in the excitation sine-wave will become obvious when the potentiometer wiper is turned toward the differentiating position (where <span class="math">Θ </span> is positive). If listened to with an audio detector, you may even hear the change in timbre while moving the wiper from one extreme to the other. If excited by a &quot;clean&quot; sine-wave, however, no change in timbre should be heard because there are no harmonics present.</p>
