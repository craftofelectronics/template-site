<p>What does it mean for an object to have an electric <em>charge</em>? Give an example of an object receiving an electric charge, and describe how that charged object might behave.</p>
<p>For an object to be electrically <em>charged</em>, it must have either a surplus or a deficit of electrons among its atoms.</p>
<p>A common example of electrically charging objects is rubbing latex balloons against wool clothing, or brushing your hair with a plastic comb. The consequences of these electric charges are very easy to perceive!</p>
<p>This question naturally leads to a discussion on atomic theory. Encourage your students to discuss and explore simple models of the atom, and how they serve to explain electricity in terms of electron placement and motion.</p>
