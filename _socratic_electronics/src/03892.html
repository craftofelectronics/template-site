<p>Identify at least one component fault that would cause the &quot;<span class="math">$\overline{Q}$</span>&quot; LED to always remain off, no matter what was done with the input switches.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03892x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>For each of your proposed faults, explain <em>why</em> it will cause the described problem.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>3</sub></span> failed open.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> NOR gate <span class="math"><em>U</em><sub>1</sub></span> output failed low.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> failed open (provided enough ambient electrical noise to activate a floating gate input).</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> &quot;Set&quot; switch contacts failed shorted.</p>
<p>Latch circuits can be confusing due to their use of positive feedback. Questions such as this are important tools for helping develop your students’ understanding of latch circuits.</p>
