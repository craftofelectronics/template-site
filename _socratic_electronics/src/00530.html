<p>An <em>oscilloscope</em> is a very useful piece of electronic test equipment. Most everyone has seen an oscilloscope in use, in the form of a heart-rate monitor (electrocardiogram, or EKG) of the type seen in doctorâ€™s offices and hospitals.</p>
<p>When monitoring heart beats, what do the two axes (horizontal and vertical) of the oscilloscope screen represent?</p>

<p>In general electronics use, when measuring AC voltage signals, what do the two axes (horizontal and vertical) of the oscilloscope screen represent?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00530x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>EKG vertical = <em>heart muscle contraction</em> ; EKG horizontal = <em>time</em></p>
<p>General-purpose vertical = <em>voltage</em> ; General-purpose horizontal = <em>time</em></p>
<p>Oscilloscope function is often best learned through interaction. Be sure to have at least one oscilloscope operational in the classroom for student interaction during discussion time.</p>
