<p>What advantage does the other voltage divider have over the circuit that is least affected by the connection of a load?</p>
<p>The divider circuit with proportionately lower-value resistors will be affected least by the application of a load. The other divider circuit has the advantage of wasting less energy.</p>
<p>Some students may be confused by the lack of a resistance value given for the load. Without a given value, how can they proceed with any calculations? Ask the other students how they solved this problem: how did they overcome the problem of not having a load resistance value to work with?</p>
