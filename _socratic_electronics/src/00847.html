<p>Ideally, when the two input terminals of an op-amp are shorted together (creating a condition of <em>zero differential voltage</em>), and those two inputs are connected directly to ground (creating a condition of <em>zero common-mode voltage</em>), what should this op-amp’s output voltage be?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00847x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>In reality, the output voltage of an op-amp under these conditions is not the same as what would be ideally predicted. Identify the fundamental problem in real op-amps, and also identify the best solution.</p>
<p>Ideally, <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>o</em><em>u</em><em>t</em></sub> = </span> 0 volts. However, the output voltage of a real op-amp under these conditions will invariably be &quot;saturated&quot; at full positive or full negative voltage due to differences in the two branches of its (internal) differential pair input circuitry. To counter this, the op-amp needs to be &quot;trimmed&quot; by external circuitry.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: the amount of differential voltage required to make the output of a real opamp settle at 0 volts is typically referred to as the <em>input offset voltage</em>. Research some typical input offset voltages for real operational amplifiers.</p>
<p>Challenge question: identify a model of op-amp that provides extra terminals for this &quot;trimming&quot; feature, and explain how it works.</p>
<p>In many ways, real op-amps fall short of their ideal expectations. However, modern op-amps are far, far better than the first models manufactured. And with such a wide variety of models to choose from, it is possible to obtain an almost perfect match for whatever design application you have, for a modest price.</p>
<p>If possible, discuss how &quot;trimming&quot; works in a real op-amp. If your students took the &quot;challenge&quot; and found some op-amp datasheets describing how to implement trimming, have them relate the connection of external components to the op-amp’s internal circuitry.</p>
