<p>This is a very practical application of resistor-capacitor (RC) circuits: to introduce a phase shift to an AC signal. Examples of where a circuit such as this may be used include oscillators (to introduce phase shift into a feedback network for a total phase shift of 360<span class="math">$^{o}$</span>) and thyristor firing control circuits (phase-shifting the triggering voltage in relation to the source voltage).</p>
