<p><em>Multiplexing</em> is a technique used in most dual-trace analog oscilloscopes. Briefly explain and the two channels of a dual-trace oscilloscope are multiplexed to the display (CRT).</p>
<p>Multiple input channels are &quot;painted&quot; one at a time on the CRT display in such a manner that it appears seamless to the human eye. This is done either by <em>alternating</em> traces or <em>chopping</em> them (alternating back and forth many times during one sweep). The reason for this is obvious: to get more functionality out of a single-gun CRT.</p>
