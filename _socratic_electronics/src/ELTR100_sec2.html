<p>When applying Ohm’s Law (<span class="math"><em>E</em> = <em>I</em><em>R</em></span> ; <span class="math">$I = {E \over R}$</span> ; <span class="math">$R = {E \over I}$</span>) to circuits containing multiple resistances, students often mix contexts of voltage, current, and resistance. Whenever you use any equation describing a physical phenomenon, be sure that each variable of that equation relates to the proper real-life value in the problem you’re working on solving. For example, when calculating the voltage drop across resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span>, you must be sure that the values for current and resistance are appropriate for that resistor and not some other resistor in the circuit. If you are calculating <span class="math"><em>E</em><sub><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></sub></span> using the Ohm’s Law equation <span class="math"><em>E</em> = <em>I</em><em>R</em></span>, then you must use the value of <em>that resistor’s</em> current (<span class="math"><em>I</em><sub><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></sub></span>) and <em>that resistor’s</em> resistance (<span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span>), not some other current and/or resistance value(s). Some students have an unfortunate tendency to overlook context when seeking values to substitute in place of variables in Ohm’s Law problems, and this leads to incorrect results.</p>
<p>Unlike current, which may be measured at a single point in a circuit, voltage is fundamentally relative: it only exists as a <em>difference</em> between two points. In other words, there is no such thing as voltage existing at a single location. Therefore, while we speak of current going <em>through</em> a component in a circuit, we speak of voltage being <em>across</em> a component, measured between two different points on that component. So confusing is this concept that a significant number of students continue to harbor conceptual errors about the nature of voltage for several months after having first learned about it. A good way to understand voltage is to experiment with a voltmeter, measuring voltage between different pairs of points in safe, low-voltage circuits. Another good way to gain proficiency is to practice on conceptual problems relating to the measurement of voltage in circuits.</p>
<p>The reason this concept is difficult to grasp is because it directly builds on the concept of voltage as a quantity relative between two points, which itself is a difficult concept to grasp. Many students find the &quot;altitude change&quot; analogy helpful in understanding how voltage exists between pairs of points, and the practice problems using that analogy to be helpful in developing confidence with this concept.</p>
