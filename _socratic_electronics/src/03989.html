<p>Use circuit simulation software to verify your predicted and actual truth tables.</p>
<p>Pushbutton switches are recommended over toggle switches for demonstrating a latch circuit. When the contacts are momentary, the latching characteristics of the circuit becomes more evident to see.</p>
<p>I have intentionally requested students try different resistance values for <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>l</em><em>i</em><em>m</em><em>i</em><em>t</em></sub></span> so they may see the effects of gate output <em>loading</em>, and the importance of proper logic level voltages. Students should try undersized resistors (10 <span class="math">Ω </span>, perhaps) on both LEDs to generate this problem, and then use oversized resistors (1000 <span class="math">Ω </span>, perhaps) to make the problem go away. Large-valued limiting resistors will cause the LEDs to be dim, but will also restore workable voltage levels so that &quot;high&quot; output states are actually interpreted as &quot;high&quot; when fed back to the gate inputs.</p>
