<p>Contrary to what you might think, the datasheet or cross-reference is not the &quot;final authority&quot; for checking your meter-based conclusions! I have seen datasheets and cross-reference manuals wrong more than once!</p>
<p>Identification of BJT terminals is a very important skill for technicians to have. Most modern multimeters have a <em>diode check</em> feature which may be used to positively identify PN junction polarities, and this is what I recommend students use for identifying BJT terminals.</p>
<p>To make this a really good performance assessment, you might want to take several BJTâ€™s and scratch the identifying labels off, so students cannot refer to memory for pin identification (for instance, if they remember the pin assignments of a 2N2222 because they use it so often). Label these transistors with your own numbers (&quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, etc.) so <em>you</em> will know which is which, but not the students!</p>
