<p>Describe what happens to the UJT as the potentiometer is slowly adjusted upward to provide a variable voltage at point <strong>A</strong> in this circuit, starting from 0 volts and ending at the trigger voltage <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>P</em></sub></span>:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02144x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Now describe what must be done to the potentiometer to cause the UJT to turn back off again.</p>
<p>The UJT will remain in the nonconducting state as the potentiometer voltage increases from 0 volts, until it reaches <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>P</em></sub></span>. At that voltage, the UJT turns on and stays on. To turn the UJT off, the potentiometer must be adjusted back down in voltage until the current through point <strong>A</strong> decreases to a certain &quot;dropout&quot; value.</p>
<p>Ask your students to describe how hysteresis is exhibited by the UJT in this scenario.</p>
