<p>Resistors are often used to drop excessive voltage so that low-voltage devices may successfully operate from the power provided by high(er)-voltage sources. For example, this 15 volt electric motor uses a resistor connected in series to be able to operate from the output of the 36 volt battery:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03352x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Calculate the necessary resistance of this resistor, as well as its minimum power rating (choose from 10 watt, 15 watt, 25 watt, 35 watt, or 50 watt).</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>R</em></span> = <span class="math"><em>P</em></span> (rating) =</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>R</em></span> = 16.15 <span class="math">Ω </span> <span class="math"><em>P</em></span> (rating) = 35 watt minimum</p>
