<p>You should know that the line voltage of a three-phase, Y-connected, balanced system is always greater than the phase voltage by a factor of <span class="math">$\sqrt{3}$</span>.</p>

<p>Apply Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law (KVL) to the upper &quot;loop&quot; in this Y-connected alternator schematic to prove how 120 V <span class="math">∠</span> 0<span class="math">$^{o}$</span> and 120 V <span class="math">∠</span> 120<span class="math">$^{o}$</span> makes 208 V. Show the &quot;polarity&quot; marks for each of the voltages as part of your answer.</p>
<p>(120 V <span class="math">∠</span> 0<span class="math">$^{o}$</span>) - (120 V <span class="math">∠</span> 120<span class="math">$^{o}$</span>) = 208 V <span class="math">∠</span> -30<span class="math">$^{o}$</span></p>
<p>(120 V <span class="math">∠</span> 120<span class="math">$^{o}$</span>) - (120 V <span class="math">∠</span> 0<span class="math">$^{o}$</span>) = 208 V <span class="math">∠</span> 150<span class="math">$^{o}$</span></p>

<p>This question is highly effective in demonstrating why polarity markings are important in AC circuit analysis. Without the polarity marks as &quot;frames of reference&quot; for the phase angles, it is impossible to determine the resultant line voltage from the two 120 VAC phase voltages.</p>
