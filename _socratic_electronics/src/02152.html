<p>The <em>oscillator</em> circuit in this diagram generates a square wave with an adjustable duty cycle:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02152x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>A student desires to use this circuit as the basis for a <em>pulse-width modulation</em> (PWM) power controller, to vary the amount of power delivered to a DC load. Since the oscillator circuit is built to produce weak signals and not deliver power directly to a load, the student adds a power MOSFET to switch heavy load currents:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02152x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Correlate the duty cycle of the oscillatorâ€™s output signal with motor power. In other words, describe how increases and decreases in signal duty cycle affect the amount of power delivered to the electric motor.</p>
<p>The greater the duty cycle, the more power delivered to the motor.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: how do you recommend a suitable oscillator <em>frequency</em> be determined for this motor control circuit? Describe how you might experiment with the circuit to determine a suitable frequency without performing any calculations.</p>
<p>As review, ask your students to identify what type of MOSFET this is (type of channel, and either depletion or enhancement mode), and what the proper oscillator signal amplitude should be to drive the MOSFET alternately between cutoff and saturation.</p>
