<p>It may seem difficult to even start on a project such as this, with no schematic diagram provided. Identify a few different sources of information where you might find sample voltage regulator circuits, to begin your design from.</p>
<p>Why do you suppose your instructor decided to challenge you with a project such as this, with no schematic diagram to follow and plenty of things to potentially go wrong?</p>
<p>Iâ€™ll let you determine where sample voltage regulator circuit designs may be found.</p>
<p>As to the question of why the instructor would challenge you in this way, the answer is quite simple: to prepare you for the realities of a challenging career in electronics. Think of this project as being a small-scale example of the work world, where you will be required to overcome technical obstacles on a routine basis, often with little or no assistance.</p>
<p>Challenges are a fact of life. It would be unrealistic to expect you to have immediate answers to every challenge you will ever face. What <em>is</em> expected of you, however, is a positive attitude and the skillful persistence to <em>find</em> those answers in due time.</p>
<p>Not much needs to be said here!</p>
