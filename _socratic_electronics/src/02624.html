<p>Explain why a sine-wave oscillator circuit requires 360 degrees of total phase shift in order to oscillate. Why not 180 degrees, 90 degrees, or some other angle?</p>
<p>360 degrees of phase shift is necessary for regenerative feedback, where the oscillating signal reinforces itself rather than dampens itself.</p>
