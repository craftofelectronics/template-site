<p>In this time-delay relay circuit, the motor will immediately start when the pushbutton is pressed, and continue to run for about 5 seconds after the pushbutton is released. The green light-emitting diode (LED) is supposed to be on whenever the motor is stopped, and off whenever the motor is running:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03535x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>However, a problem has developed with this circuit. The green LED always remains on and the motor never starts, no matter what is done with the pushbutton switch. Based on this information, determine the following:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> components or wires in the circuit that you know cannot be failed either open or shorted, besides the 24 volt source.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> components or wires in the circuit you think could possibly be bad (either one independently capable of causing the problem), and the type of failure each would be (either open or shorted).</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Wire from TP1 to TP4</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> All wires from TP2 to LED cathode</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> LED</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Relay coil failed open.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Pushbutton switch failed open.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Wire from TP3 to coil failed open.</p>
