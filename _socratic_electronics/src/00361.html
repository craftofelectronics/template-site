<p>Some ohmmeters have a range where the measurement is expressed in units of <em>siemens</em> (usually <em>micro</em>siemens, or <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>S). What is a &quot;siemens,&quot; and how does it relate to the unit of the &quot;ohm&quot;?</p>
<p>The unit of the &quot;siemens&quot; is a measurement of <em>conductance</em>, the reciprocal of <em>resistance</em>:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$G = {1 \over R}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Where,</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>G</em> = </span> conductance, in siemens</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>R</em> = </span> resistance, in ohms</p>
<p>Challenge question: what was the old unit for conductance, prior to the siemens? You will find it makes more sense than siemens, just as the old metric unit of temperature (&quot;centigrade&quot;) makes more sense than the new unit (celsius).</p>
<p>Ask your students, &quot;is 1 microsiemens equivalent to a large resistance or a small resistance?&quot; Have them explain their answer, without using a calculator.</p>
