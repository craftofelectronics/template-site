<p>Suppose you were handed a black box with two metal terminals on one side, for attaching electrical (wire) connections. Inside this box, you were told, was a current source (an ideal current source connected in parallel with a resistance):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01038x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>How would you experimentally determine the current of the ideal current source inside this box, and how would you experimentally determine the resistance of the parallel resistor? By &quot;experimentally,&quot; I mean determine current and resistance using actual test equipment rather than assuming certain component values (remember, this &quot;black box&quot; is sealed, so you cannot look inside!).</p>
<p>Measure the open-circuit voltage between the two terminals, and then measure the short-circuit current. The current source’s value is measured, while the resistor’s value is calculated using Ohm’s Law.</p>
<p>Ask your students how they would apply this technique to an abstract circuit problem, to reduce a complex network of sources and resistances to a single current source and single parallel resistance (Norton equivalent).</p>
