<p><em>Wire nuts</em> are special electrical connection devices commonly used in residential power wiring. Describe what a &quot;wire nut&quot; is and how they are used to make connections between wires.</p>
<p>&quot;Wire nuts&quot; are electrical fasteners which use a coiled spring to clasp bare metal wire ends together. The &quot;nut&quot; is screwed on to the ends of two or more wires to be joined, as though it were a nut being threaded onto a bolt. The coils of the spring inside the nut function as threads, which grip the wire ends tighter as the nut is turned clockwise over them.</p>
<p>It would be good to have several sizes of wire nuts available in the classroom for your students to see and touch during discussion.</p>
