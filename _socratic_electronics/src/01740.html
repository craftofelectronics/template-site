<p>Use Kirchhoff’s Current Law to calculate the magnitude and direction of the current through resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>4</sub></span> in this resistor network:</p>

<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01740x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>It is not necessary to know anything about series-parallel or even parallel circuits in order to solve the <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>4</sub></span>’s current – all one needs to know is how to use Kirchhoff’s Current Law.</p>
