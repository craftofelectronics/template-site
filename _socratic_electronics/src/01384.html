<p>A common type of rotary encoder is one built to produce a <em>quadrature</em> output:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01384x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The two LED/phototransistor pairs are arranged in such a way that their pulse outputs are always 90<span class="math">$^{o}$</span> out of phase with each other. Quadrature output encoders are useful because they allow us to determine direction of motion as well as incremental position.</p>
<p>Building a quadrature direction detector circuit is easy, if you use a D-type flip-flop:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01384x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Analyze this circuit, and explain how it works.</p>
<p>The operation of this circuit is quite easy to understand if you draw a pulse diagram for it and analyze the flip-flop’s output over time. When the encoder disk spins clockwise, the <span class="math"><em>Q</em></span> output goes high; when counterclockwise, the <span class="math"><em>Q</em></span> goes low.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: comment on the notation used for this circuit’s output. What does the label &quot;<span class="math">$CW / \overline{CCW}$</span>&quot; tell you, without having to analyze the circuit at all?</p>
<p>Quadrature direction-detection circuits such as this become important when encoders are linked to digital counter circuits. The complemented notation is also very common in counter circuits.</p>
<p>Students may show a reluctance to draw a timing diagram when they approach this problem, even when they realize the utility of such a diagram. Instead, many will try to figure the circuit out just by looking at it. Note the emphasis on the word &quot;try.&quot; This circuit is much more difficult to figure out without a timing diagram! Withhold your explanation of this circuit until each student shows you a timing diagram for it. Emphasize the fact that this step, although it consumes a bit of time, is actually a time-saver in the end.</p>
