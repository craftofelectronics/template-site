<p>Explain why this bridge circuit can <em>never</em> achieve balance:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01862x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Even though impedance magnitudes may be balanced, the phase angles cannot.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: explain why it would <em>not</em> work to use an oscilloscope as the &quot;detector&quot; in this bridge circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01862x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Hint: beware of <em>ground connections!</em></p>
<p>Challenge question: explain how you <em>could</em> use this same oscilloscope as the detector in this bridge circuit without changing the ground location at the lower terminal of the AC source.</p>
<p>Explain to your students that AC bridges, while fundamentally the same as DC bridges, do have their differences. Their knowledge of AC circuit calculations (with complex numbers) should be enough for them to see why this is so.</p>
