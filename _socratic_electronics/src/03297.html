<p>The following circuit has a problem. When the switch is closed, the lamp does not turn on:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03297x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Identify which of these hypothetical faults could account for this problem, and which could not account for the problem. In other words, which of these faults are possible, and which are not possible, given the symptoms exhibited by the circuit? Consider each of these hypothetical faults one at a time (no multiple, simultaneous faults):</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Light bulb filament failed open</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Switch failed shorted</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Switch failed open</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Light bulb filament failed open: <em>Possible</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Switch failed shorted: <em>Not possible</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Switch failed open: <em>Possible</em></p>
<p>Follow-up question: if we allow ourselves to consider more than one fault occurring at the same time, does the &quot;switch failed shorted&quot; scenario become possible? Explain why or why not.</p>
<p>This question helps students build the skill of eliminating unlikely fault possibilities, allowing them to concentrate instead on what is more likely. An important skill in system troubleshooting is the ability to formulate probabilities for various fault scenarios. Without this skill, you will waste a lot of time looking for unlikely faults, thereby wasting time.</p>
<p>For each fault scenario it is important to ask your students <em>why</em> they think it is possible or not possible. It might be that some students get the right answer(s) for the wrong reasons, so it is good to explore the reasoning for each answer.</p>
