<p>Something is wrong with this regulated DC power supply circuit. The output is supposed to be +10.0 volts, but instead it measures about 16 volts:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02661x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Using your digital multimeter, you measure 10.0 volts between test points TP5 (red test lead) and TP4 (black test lead). From this information, identify two possible faults that could account for the problem and all measured values in this circuit, and also identify two circuit elements that could not possibly be to blame (i.e. two things that you know <em>must</em> be functioning properly, no matter what else may be faulted) other than the 120 volt AC power source, on/off switch, and fuse. The circuit elements you identify as either possibly faulted or properly functioning can be wires, traces, and connections as well as components. Be as specific as you can in your answers, identifying both the circuit element and the type of fault.</p>

<p>Ask your students to identify means by which they could confirm suspected circuit elements, by measuring something other than what has already been measured.</p>
<p>Troubleshooting scenarios are always good for stimulating class discussion. Be sure to spend plenty of time in class with your students developing efficient and logical diagnostic procedures, as this will assist them greatly in their careers.</p>
