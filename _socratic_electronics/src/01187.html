<p>This is a schematic for a simple VCO:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01187x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The oscillator is of the RC &quot;phase shift&quot; design. Explain how this circuit works. Why does the output frequency vary as the control voltage varies? Does the output frequency increase or decrease as the control voltage input receives a more positive voltage?</p>
<p>Hint: the JFETs in this circuit are not functioning as amplifiers!</p>
<p>To understand how the JFETs are functioning in this VCO design, closely examine the &quot;saturation&quot; regions of a JFET’s characteristic curves. Note that these regions appear as nearly straight-line sections. This indicates something about the behavior of a saturated JFET that is exploited in this VCO circuit.</p>
<p>The output frequency <em>decreases</em> as the control voltage becomes more positive.</p>
<p>Not only does this question allow students to examine the workings of a VCO, but it also provides a good review of JFET theory, as well as a practical example of a special application of junction field-effect transistors.</p>
<p>Note: the schematic diagram for this circuit was derived from one found on page 997 of John Markus’ , first edition. Apparently, the design originated from a Motorola publication on using field effect transistors (&quot;Low Frequency Applications of Field-Effect Transistors,&quot; AN-511, 1971).</p>
