<p>Suppose this battery and light bulb circuit failed to work:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00121x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Using nothing but a voltmeter, a technician measures voltage between the following sets of points:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Between A and C: 0 volts</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Between D and G: 12 volts</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Between E and J: 0 volts</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Between B and E: 12 volts</p>
<p>From these voltage measurements, what can you tell about the condition of the battery, wiring, and light bulb? Be as specific as you can.</p>
<p>Challenge question: identify which of the four measurement are unnecessary in determining the precise location of the fault in this circuit.</p>
<p>Based on these measurements, we are able to determine that the battery’s voltage is 12 volts, that the light bulb has good continuity, and that there is a single break in the circuit between points D and E.</p>
<p>Challenge answer: the two &quot;0 volt&quot; measurements are unnecessary in determining the location of the fault in this circuit.</p>
<p>Scenarios such as this are excellent for group discussion, encouraging students to think critically about the data and to apply their practical knowledge of electricity to a realistic problem.</p>
