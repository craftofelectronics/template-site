<p>A variation on the gated S-R latch circuit is something called the <em>D-latch</em>:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01357x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Complete the truth table for this D latch circuit, and identify which rows in the truth table represent the <em>set</em>, <em>reset</em>, and <em>latch</em> states, respectively.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01357x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Since this gate does not actually have &quot;Set&quot; and &quot;Reset&quot; inputs, ask your students to explain what conditions define the &quot;set&quot; and &quot;reset&quot; states. Note that these state labels may be applied to <em>any</em> type of latch circuit.</p>
<p>To many of your students, this latch circuit may seem rather useless. Explain to them that this basic latch may be used to form <em>memory cells</em>, with each D latch storing 1 binary bit of information! Ask your students to explain, in their own words, how the latching action of this circuit constitutes a memory function. Under what condition(s) will the stored information in a D latch memory cell be lost?</p>
