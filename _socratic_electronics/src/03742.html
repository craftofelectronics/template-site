<p>Suppose this regulated power supply circuit used to function fine, but now has stopped outputting any DC voltage at all:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03742x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Initial diagnostic measurements show there to be full DC (unregulated) voltage across capacitor <span class="math"><em>C</em><sub>1</sub></span>, and no DC voltage between the transistor base and ground. From this data, where would you suspect the problem is?</p>
<p>Most likely <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> failed open or the zener diode <span class="math"><em>D</em><sub>5</sub></span> failed shorted, such that the transistor is not being &quot;told&quot; to output any voltage at its emitter terminal.</p>
<p>Ask your students why the diagnostic measurements described in the question are good points to check (in the order that they were taken).</p>
