<p>Complete the truth table for the following relay logic circuit, and then complete a second truth table for the same circuit with relay coil CR2 failed open:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03826x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Explain <em>why</em> the truth table will be modified as a result of the fault.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03826x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>If you thought that the &quot;faulted&quot; truth table would be all 0â€™s, you probably thought I said relay <em>contact</em> CR2 failed open. The fault I proposed was relay CR2 <strong>coil</strong> failed open.</p>
<p>The purpose of this question is to approach the domain of circuit troubleshooting from a perspective of knowing what the fault is, rather than only knowing what the symptoms are. Although this is not necessarily a realistic perspective, it helps students build the foundational knowledge necessary to diagnose a faulted circuit from empirical data. Questions such as this should be followed (eventually) by other questions asking students to identify likely faults based on measurements.</p>
