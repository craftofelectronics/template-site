<p>JFET amplifiers tend to have less predictable voltage gains than their BJT counterparts. Since this is considered a disadvantage of JFET amplifiers, identify at least one advantage they enjoy over BJT amplifiers.</p>
<p>JFET amplifiers draw less input current (i.e. have greater input impedance) than their BJT counterparts. Their biasing circuits may also be simpler (if self-bias is used).</p>
