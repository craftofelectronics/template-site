<p>Why is this sign a joke?</p>

<p>Electrical <em>resistance</em> is not hazardous in the least. In fact, the more resistance there is, the less chance there is for electrons to flow, thus minimizing shock hazard.</p>
<p>A joke it may be, but still a fun one to play. Hang a large sign saying &quot;Danger: high resistance&quot; over the entrance to the electrical lab and watch the responses of the uninitiated!</p>
