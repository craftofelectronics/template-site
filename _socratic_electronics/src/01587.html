<p>In order to successfully troubleshoot any electronic circuit to the component level, one must have a good understanding of each component’s function within the context of that circuit. Transistor amplifiers are no exception to this rule. The following schematic shows a simple, two-stage audio amplifier circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01587x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Identify the role of the following components in this audio amplifier circuit:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> The <span class="math">$0.47 \&gt; \mu \hbox{F}$</span> capacitor connected to the microphone</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> The <span class="math">$220 \hbox{ k} \Omega$</span> and <span class="math">$27 \hbox{ k} \Omega$</span> resistor pair</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> The <span class="math">$4.7 \&gt; \mu \hbox{F}$</span> electrolytic capacitor connected across the <span class="math">$1.5 \hbox{ k} \Omega$</span> resistor</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> The <span class="math">$33 \&gt; \mu \hbox{F}$</span> electrolytic capacitor connected to the speaker</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> The <span class="math">$47 \&gt; \mu \hbox{F}$</span> electrolytic capacitor connected to the power supply rail</p>
<p>Additionally, answer the following questions concerning the circuit’s design:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> What configuration is each stage (common-base, common-collector, common-emitter)?</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Why not just use one transistor stage to drive the speaker? Why is an additional stage necessary?</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> What might happen if the <span class="math">$47 \&gt; \mu \hbox{F}$</span> &quot;decoupling&quot; capacitor were not in the circuit?</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Why does the second stage of the amplifier not need its own voltage divider to set bias voltage as the first stage does?</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> The <span class="math">$0.47 \&gt; \mu \hbox{F}$</span> capacitor connected to the microphone: <em>passes (AC) audio signal, blocks DC bias voltage from reaching microphone</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> The <span class="math">$220 \hbox{ k} \Omega$</span> and <span class="math">$27 \hbox{ k} \Omega$</span> resistor pair: <em>sets DC bias voltage for first transistor stage</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> The <span class="math">$4.7 \&gt; \mu \hbox{F}$</span> electrolytic capacitor connected across the <span class="math">$1.5 \hbox{ k} \Omega$</span> resistor: <em>bypasses (AC) audio signal around emitter resistor, for maximum AC voltage gain</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> The <span class="math">$33 \&gt; \mu \hbox{F}$</span> electrolytic capacitor connected to the speaker: <em>couples (AC) audio signal to speaker while blocking DC bias voltage from speaker</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> The <span class="math">$47 \&gt; \mu \hbox{F}$</span> electrolytic capacitor connected to the power supply rail: <em>&quot;decouples&quot; any AC signal from the power supply, by providing a low-impedance (short) path to ground</em></p>
<p>The question regarding the necessity of the 47 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>F decoupling capacitor is tricky to answer, so I’ll elaborate a bit here. Power supply decoupling is a good design practice, because it can ward off a wide range of problems. AC &quot;ripple&quot; voltage should never be present on the power supply &quot;rail&quot; conductors, as transistor circuits function best with pure DC power. The purpose of a decoupling capacitor is to subdue any ripple, whatever its source, by acting as a low-impedance &quot;short&quot; to ground for AC while not presenting any loading to the DC power.</p>
<p>Although it may not seem possible at first inspection, the lack of a decoupling capacitor in this audio amplifier circuit can actually lead to self-oscillation (where the amplifier becomes a tone generator) under certain power supply and load conditions! If the power supply is poorly regulated and/or poorly filtered, the presence of a decoupling capacitor will greatly diminish line-frequency &quot;hum&quot; noise heard in the speaker.</p>
<p>For the rest of the questions, I’ll let you figure out answers on your own!</p>
<p>Incidentally, this circuit makes a good &quot;intercom&quot; amplifier for a student project. Using a small dynamic speaker for the microphone, and another speaker (or audio headset) on the receiving end of a long cable connected to the amplifier output, students can easily talk between two rooms in a building, or even between buildings.</p>
