<p>After experimenting some with this intercom circuit, you will find that there is a point on the volume control below which so little sound is reproduced that it is almost useless, and a point above which there is substantial distortion. Explain how you could place &quot;stops&quot; to limit the volume control range so that the user could not adjust past these points, making the volume control more useful.</p>
<p>Place &quot;stop&quot; resistors before and after the potentiometer, sized appropriately to limit the minimum and maximum volumes to whatever levels are desired:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02747x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>This technique is frequently used to &quot;bound&quot; the range of a potentiometer within a pair of desired limits. For a circuit such as this, the only way to really determine where the upper and lower limits are is by experimenting.</p>
