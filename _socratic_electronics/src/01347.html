<p>A very common form of <em>latch</em> circuit is the simple &quot;start-stop&quot; relay circuit used for motor controls, whereby a pair of momentary-contact pushbutton switches control the operation of an electric motor. In this particular case, I show a low-voltage control circuit and a 3-phase, higher voltage motor:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01347x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Explain the operation of this circuit, from the time the &quot;Start&quot; switch is actuated to the time the &quot;Stop&quot; switch is actuated. The normally-open M1 contact shown in the low-voltage control circuit is commonly called a <em>seal-in contact</em>. Explain what this contact does, and why it might be called a &quot;seal-in&quot; contact.</p>
<p>Even though the &quot;Start&quot; and &quot;Stop&quot; switches are momentary, the &quot;seal-in&quot; contact makes the circuit <em>latch</em> in one of two states: either motor energized or motor de-energized.</p>
<p>Motor &quot;start-stop&quot; circuits are very common in industry, and apply to applications beyond electric motors. Ask your students if they can think of any application for a circuit such as this.</p>
