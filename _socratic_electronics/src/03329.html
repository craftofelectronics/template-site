<p>Manipulate each of these equations to solve for <span class="math"><em>a</em></span>:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">${{a - b} \over c} = d^2 \hbox{\hskip 140pt} b + a^2 = {c \over d}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$a = cd^2 + b \hbox{\hskip 140pt} a = \sqrt{{c \over d} - b}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Have your students come to the front of the class and show everyone else the techniques they used to solve for <span class="math"><em>a</em></span> in each equation. Remind them to document each and every step in the process, so that nothing is left to guess or to chance.</p>
