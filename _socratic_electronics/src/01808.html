<p>Calculate the final value of current through the inductor with the switch in the left-hand position (assuming that many time constants’ worth of time have passed):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01808x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Now, assume that the switch is <em>instantly</em> moved to the right-hand position. How much voltage will the inductor initially drop?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01808x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Explain why this voltage is so very different from the supply voltage. What practical uses might a circuit such as this have?</p>
<p><span class="math">$I_{switch-left} = 2 \hbox{ mA}$</span></p>
<p><span class="math">$V_{switch-right} = 182 \hbox{ V}$</span></p>
<p>Follow-up question: suppose this circuit were built and tested, and it was found that the voltage developed across the inductor at the moment the switch moved to the right-hand position far exceeded 182 volts. Identify some possible problems in the circuit which could account for this excessive voltage.</p>
<p>The main purpose of this question is to get students thinking in terms of &quot;initial&quot; and &quot;final&quot; values for LR circuits, and how one might calculate them. It is largely a conceptual question, with just a bit of calculation necessary.</p>
<p>One practical application of this circuit is for &quot;stepping up&quot; DC voltage. The circuit topology shown in the question is that of an <em>inverting</em> converter circuit. This form of DC-DC converter circuit has the ability to step voltage up <em>or</em> down, depending on the duty cycle of the switch’s oscillation.</p>
