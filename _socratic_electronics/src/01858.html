<p>A common way of representing complex electronic systems is the <em>block diagram</em>, where specific functional sections of a system are outlined as squares or rectangles, each with a certain purpose and each having input(s) and output(s). For an example, here is a block diagram of an analog (&quot;Cathode Ray&quot;) oscilloscope, or <em>CRO</em>:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01858x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Block diagrams may also be helpful in representing and understanding filter circuits. Consider these symbols, for instance:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01858x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Which of these represents a <em>low-pass</em> filter, and which represents a <em>high-pass filter</em>? Explain your reasoning.</p>
<p>Also, identify the new filter functions created by the compounding of low- and high-pass filter &quot;blocks&quot;:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01858x03.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01858x04.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Aside from getting students to understand that band-function filters may be built from sets of low- and high-pass filter blocks, this question is really intended to initiate problem-solving activity. Discuss with your students how they might approach a problem like this to see how the circuits respond. What &quot;thought experiments&quot; did they try in their minds to investigate these circuits?</p>
