<p>Suppose an amplifier circuit is connected to a sine-wave signal generator, and a spectrum analyzer used to measure both the input and the output signals of the amplifier:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03307x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Interpret the two graphical displays and explain why the output signal has more &quot;peaks&quot; than the input. What is this difference telling us about the amplifier’s performance?</p>
<p>The input signal is clean: a single peak at the 1 kHz mark. The amplifier’s output, on the other hand, is a bit distorted (i.e. no longer a perfect sine-wave shape as the input is).</p>
<p>The purpose of this question is to get students to realize the presence of harmonics means a departure from a once-perfect sinusoidal wave-shape. What used to be free of harmonics now contains harmonics, and this indicates distortion of the sine wave somewhere within the amplifier.</p>
<p>By the way, the perfectly flat &quot;noise floor&quot; at -120 dB is highly unusual. There will always be a &quot;rough&quot; floor shown on the display of a spectrum analyzer, but this is not pertinent to the question at hand so I omitted it for simplicity’s sake.</p>
