<p>The line voltage to this three-phase load is 480 volts. How much power (total) is dissipated by the load? How much current is there in each line supplying the load?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00421x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>One more question: write an equation for calculating power in a balanced, three-phase circuit, given line voltage and line current only.</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>P</em><sub><em>t</em><em>o</em><em>t</em><em>a</em><em>l</em></sub> = </span> 27.648 kW</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>I</em><sub><em>l</em><em>i</em><em>n</em><em>e</em></sub></span> = 33.255 A</p>
<p>I’ll let you derive your own equation for power calculation. Be ready to show your work!</p>
<p>Now, students will surely be able to find a power equation from textbooks, but the purpose of this question is to have them derive it themselves. In a single-phase, resistive AC circuit, power is given by the equation <span class="math"><em>P</em> = <em>I</em><em>E</em></span>, just as in DC circuits. However, if you multiply the line voltage by line current, you do not get the correct answer of 27.648 kW. So, obviously, the equation of <span class="math"><em>P</em> = <em>I</em><em>E</em></span> will require some modification for calculating total three-phase power. However, this modification is not complicated to perform.</p>
