<p>In this circuit, where would you <em>not</em> expect to measure significant voltage (between what pairs of test points)?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00120x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>You should not measure any significant voltage between any of the test points along the upper wire (A to B, A to C, A to D, etc.), nor between any of the test points along the lower wire (F to G, F to H, F to I, etc.). As a general rule, points in a circuit that are <em>electrically common</em> to each other should never have voltage between them.</p>
<p>The answer uses a concept which I’ve found to be very helpful in understanding electrical circuits: the idea of points in a circuit being <em>electrically common</em> to each other. Simply put, this means the points are connected together by conductors of negligible resistance. Having nearly 0 ohms of resistance between points assures insignificant voltage drop, even for large currents.</p>
<p>Conversely, if significant voltage is measured between points in a circuit, you can be assured that those points are <em>not</em> electrically common to each other. Engage your students in a discussion of electrical commonality and expected voltage drops:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> If voltage is measured between two points in a circuit, are those two points electrically common to each other? Why or why not?</p>
