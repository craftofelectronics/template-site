<p>What will happen to the brightness of the light bulb as the iron core is moved away from the wire coil in this circuit? Explain why this happens.</p>

<p>The light bulb will glow brighter when the iron core is moved away from the wire coil, due to the change in inductive reactance (X<span class="math">$_{L}$</span>).</p>
<p>Follow-up question: what circuit failure(s) could cause the light bulb to glow brighter than it should?</p>
<p>One direction you might want to lead your students in with this question is how AC power may be controlled using this principle. Controlling AC power with a variable <em>reactance</em> has a definite advantage over controlling AC power with a variable <em>resistance</em>: less wasted energy in the form of heat.</p>
