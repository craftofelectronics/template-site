<p>Suppose a GFCI is rated to &quot;trip&quot; with a ground fault current of 5 mA. Given a source voltage of 115 volts, calculate the ground fault resistance range required to trip.</p>
<p>Any resistance value between 0 <span class="math">Ω </span> to 23 k<span class="math">Ω </span></p>
<p>This question requires the use of Ohm’s Law, but to calculate a <em>range</em> of resistance values and not just a singular value. All students should be able to obtain the figure of 23 k<span class="math">Ω </span>, but some may be confused as to whether this is a minimum or a maximum resistance value needed to trip the GFCI. Discuss this with your students, asking them to explain how we know 23 k<span class="math">Ω </span> is a maximum figure and not a minimum figure.</p>
