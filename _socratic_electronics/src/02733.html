<p>Suppose a technician is checking the operation of the following electronic circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02733x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>She decides to measure the voltage on either side of resistor R1 with reference to ground, and obtains these readings:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02733x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>On the top side of R1, the voltage with reference to ground is -5.04 volts. On the bottom side of R1, the voltage with reference to ground is -1.87 volts. The color code of resistor R1 is Yellow, Violet, Orange, Gold. From this information, determine the following:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Voltage across R1 (between top to bottom):</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Polarity (+ and -) of voltage across R1:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Current (magnitude) through R1:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Direction of current through R1:</p>
<p>Additionally, explain how this technician would make each one of these determinations. What rules or laws of electric circuits would she apply?</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Voltage across R1 (between top to bottom): <strong>3.17 volts</strong></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Polarity (+ and -) of voltage across R1: <strong>(-) on top, (+) on bottom</strong></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Current (magnitude) through R1: <strong>67.45 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>A</strong></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Direction of current through R1: <strong>upward, following conventional flow</strong></p>
<p>Follow-up question: calculate the range of possible currents, given the specified tolerance of resistor R1 (67.45 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>A assumes 0% error).</p>
<p>Challenge question: if you recognize the type of circuit this is (by the part number of the IC &quot;chip&quot;: TL082), identify the voltage between pin 3 and ground.</p>
<p>This is a good example of how Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law is more than just an abstract tool for mathematical analysis – it is also a powerful technique for practical circuit diagnosis. Students must apply KVL to determine the voltage drop across R1, and then use Ohm’s Law to calculate its current.</p>
<p>If students experience difficulty visualizing how KVL plays a part in the solution of this problem, show them this illustration:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02733x03.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>By the way, the answer to the challenge question may only be realized if students recognize this circuit as a noninverting opamp voltage amplifier. The voltage at pin 3 (noninverting input) will be the same as the voltage at pin 2 (inverting input): -1.87 volts.</p>
