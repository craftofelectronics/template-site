<p>Very interesting things happen to resonant systems when they are &quot;excited&quot; by external sources of oscillation. For example, a <em>pendulum</em> is a simple example of a mechanically resonant system, and we all know from experience with swings in elementary school that we can make a pendulum achieve very high amplitudes of oscillation if we &quot;oscillate&quot; our legs at just the right times to match the swingâ€™s natural (resonant) frequency.</p>
<p>Identify an example of a mechanically resonant system that is &quot;excited&quot; by an external source of oscillations near its resonant frequency. Hint: research the word &quot;resonance&quot; in engineering textbooks, and you are sure to read about some dramatic examples of resonance in action.</p>
<p>Large buildings have (very low) resonant frequencies, that may be matched by the motion of the ground in an earthquake, so that even a relatively small earthquake can cause major damage to the building.</p>
<p>Challenge question: after researching the behavior of mechanical resonant systems when driven by external oscillations of the same frequency, determine what the effects might be of external oscillations on an <em>electrical</em> resonant system.</p>
<p>Many, many examples of mechanical resonance exist, some of which are quite dramatic. A famous example of destructive mechanical resonance (of a well-known bridge in Washington state) has been immortalized in video form, and is easily available on the internet. If possible, provide the means within your classroom to display a video clip on computer, for any of the students who happen to find this video file and bring it to discussion.</p>
