<p>Define what an <em>oscillator</em> circuit is, using your own words. Give a few examples of oscillators at work in common devices and systems.</p>
<p>Here is a sample definition:</p>
<p>An &quot;oscillator&quot; is a device that produces oscillations (back-and-forth) changes – usually an electronic circuit that produces AC – from a steady (DC) source of power.</p>
<p>I’ll let you determine some practical oscillator applications on your own!</p>
<p>Oscillators are nearly ubiquitous in a modern society. If your students’ only examples are electronic in nature, you may want to mention these mechanical devices:</p>
