<p>Describe what a <em>load line</em> is, at it appears superimposed on this graph of characteristic transistor curves:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01681x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>What exactly does the load line represent in the circuit?</p>
<p>A <em>load line</em> is a plot showing the amount of collector-emitter voltage available to the transistor (<span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>C</em><em>E</em></sub></span>) for any given collector current:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01681x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Follow-up question: why are load lines always straight, and not bent as the transistor characteristic curves are? What is it that ensures load line plots will always be linear functions?</p>
<p>It is very important for students to grasp the ontological nature of load lines (i.e. <em>what they are</em>) if they are to use them frequently in transistor circuit analysis. This, sadly, is something often not grasped by students when they begin to study transistor circuits, and I place the blame squarely on textbooks (and instructors) who donâ€™t spend enough time introducing the concept.</p>
<p>My favorite way of teaching students about load lines is to have them plot load lines for non-transistor circuits, such as voltage dividers (with one of two resistors labeled as the &quot;load,&quot; and the other resistor made variable) and diode-resistor circuits.</p>
