<p>Explain how the ground wire (connecting the metal case of the heater to earth ground) helps ensure the safety of anyone touching the case.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03436x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Also, label the three wires between the power source and the heater: <em>Hot</em>, <em>Neutral</em>, and <em>Ground</em>.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03436x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>I recommend assigning one point per correctly labeled wire, five points for correctly explaining how the ground wire helps ensure safety.</p>
