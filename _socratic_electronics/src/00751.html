<p>Suppose you were building a Class-A transistor amplifier for audio frequency use, but did not have an oscilloscope available to check the output waveform for the presence of &quot;clipping&quot; caused by improper biasing. You do, however, have a pair of audio headphones you may use to listen to the signals.</p>
<p>Explain how you would use a pair of headphones to check for the presence of severe distortion in a waveform.</p>
<p>Set the signal generator to &quot;sine-wave,&quot; and the aural difference between a pure sine wave and a distorted (&quot;clipped&quot;) sine wave will be very apparent.</p>
<p>The answer I want for this question is not just a parroting of the answer Iâ€™ve given. Anyone can say &quot;a distorted wave will sound different.&quot; I want to know <em>how</em> it sounds different, and this answer can only come by direct experimentation!</p>
