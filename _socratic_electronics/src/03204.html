<p>Explain what would happen if a wire broke as shown (at the &quot;X&quot; mark) in this motor control circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03204x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The motor would start as soon as the &quot;Start&quot; pushbutton was actuated, but it would stop immediately when that same pushbutton was de-actuated. In other words, it would not &quot;latch&quot; in the run state.</p>
