<p>An incandescent light bulb has a filament resistance of 5.7 <span class="math">Ω </span> when at room temperature (20<span class="math">$^{o}$</span> C), but draws only 225 mA when powered by a 12 volt DC source. Given that the filament is made out of tungsten metal, calculate its temperature in degrees F when powered by the 12 VDC source.</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>T</em> = </span> 3,484<span class="math">$^{o}$</span>F</p>
<p>Solving this problem requires several concepts be integrated: Ohm’s Law, converting between different temperature units, and calculating temperature from shift in resistance.</p>
