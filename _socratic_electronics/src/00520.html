<p>Draw a schematic diagram showing a DC generator charging a battery, and another schematic showing a battery discharging into a resistive load. Be sure to include arrows in your drawing showing the direction of charging current.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00520x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Follow-up question #1: how must the battery and generator voltages compare in order for the battery to have current forced &quot;backward&quot; through it?</p>
<p>Follow-up question #2: which is the <em>source</em> component, and which is the <em>load</em> component in a circuit where a generator charges a secondary-cell battery? Explain your reasoning.</p>
<p>It is very important for students to understand the direction of current through a battery, both when charging and when discharging. A helpful perspective on this topic is to think of the battery either as being a <em>source</em> of electrical energy versus being a <em>load</em>. Under which conditions (charging or discharging) is the battery playing the role of source versus load?</p>
