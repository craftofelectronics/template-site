<p>What is absolutely the best way to protect yourself from the dangers of arc blast while performing maintenance work on high energy electrical circuits?</p>
<p>Ensure that the system is de-energized (lock-out / tag-out) prior to performing the work.</p>
<p>Students have asked me on many occasions if maintenance work on high-voltage systems is dangerous. My answer to this question is that &quot;if you follow proper procedure, itâ€™s all 0 volts by the time you touch it!&quot; So, no, working on a de-energized 13.8 kV electrical system is no more dangerous than working on a de-energized 480 volt system or even a de-energized 120 volt system. All these voltages are lethal under the right conditions. The only real difference is psychological: high-voltage systems are <em>scarier</em> because the danger is more evident.</p>
