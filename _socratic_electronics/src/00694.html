<p>The <em>Superposition Theorem</em> works nicely to calculate voltages and currents in resistor circuits. But can it be used to calculate power dissipations as well? Why or why not? Be specific with your answer.</p>
<p>The Superposition Theorem cannot be directly used to calculate power.</p>
<p>In order to answer this question correctly (without just looking up the answer in a book), students will have to perform a few power calculations in simple, multiple-source circuits. It may be worthwhile to work through a couple of example problems during discussion time, to illustrate the answer.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that resistor power dissipations cannot be superimposed to obtain the answer(s), it is still possible to use the Superposition Theorem to calculate resistor power dissipations in a multiple-source circuit. Challenge your students with the task of applying this theorem for solving power dissipations in a circuit.</p>
