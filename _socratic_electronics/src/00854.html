<p>Write an equation that solves for the admittance of this parallel circuit. The equation need not solve for the phase angle between voltage and current, but merely provide a scalar figure for admittance (in siemens):</p>

<p><span class="math">$Y_{total} = \sqrt{G^2 + (B_L - B_C)^2}$</span></p>
<p>Ask your students why one of the reactance terms under the radicand is positive and the other is negative. The way this equation is written, does it matter which term is negative? Ask your students if we would obtain the same answer if the equation were written as <span class="math">$Y_{total} = \sqrt{G^2 + (B_C - B_L)^2}$</span> instead. Challenge them to answer this question without using a calculator!</p>
