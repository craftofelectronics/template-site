<p>Totem-pole TTL gates usually differ greatly in their maximum source current versus maximum sink current (<span class="math"><em>I</em><sub><em>O</em><em>H</em></sub></span> versus <span class="math"><em>I</em><sub><em>O</em><em>L</em></sub></span>). Identify which current rating is usually greater, and also explain why this is.</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>I</em><sub><em>O</em><em>L</em></sub></span> is typically much greater than <span class="math"><em>I</em><sub><em>O</em><em>H</em></sub></span> for a TTL gate with totem-pole output circuitry. The reason for this should be obvious from inspection of the internal circuitry.</p>
<p>It should be noted that totem-pole TTL gates can actually source far more current than what is advertised without sustaining damage. The severe limitation on sourcing current is more a function of staying within the permitted output voltage margins for TTL than it is a function of chip heating. Thus, you may generally use a totem-pole TTL gate to source 20 mA to an LED without harm, though the &quot;high&quot; state output voltage (when the LED is lit) will be significantly below the acceptable threshold for a TTL gate <em>input</em>.</p>
