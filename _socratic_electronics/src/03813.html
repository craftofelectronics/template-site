<p>Explain how a <em>crystal</em> microphone works. Identify how the principle of piezoelectricity is put to practical use in this device.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: characterize the typical output impedance of this microphone type. Is it generally considered a low-impedance or a high-impedance type of microphone? Why do you think this is?</p>
<p>In a crystal microphone, a small piezoelectric crystal is stressed and unstressed by sound wave pressure, generating a voltage representative of the sound wave oscillations.</p>
<p>Ask your students where they located this information. it is important for students to learn where and how to research for needed information.</p>
