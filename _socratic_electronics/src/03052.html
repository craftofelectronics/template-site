<p>When evaluating (calculating) a mathematical expression, what order should you do the various expressions in? In other words, which comes first: multiplication, division, addition, subtraction, powers, roots, parentheses, etc.; and then what comes after that, and after that?</p>
<p>Do what is inside parentheses first (the furthest &quot;inside&quot; parentheses if there are multiple layers of parentheses), powers and roots, functions (trig, log, etc.), multiplication/division, and finally addition/subtraction.</p>
<p>Order of operations is extremely important, as it becomes critical to recognize proper order of evaluation when &quot;stripping&quot; an expression down to isolate a particular variable. In essence, the normal order of operations is reversed when &quot;undoing&quot; an expression, so students must recognize what the proper order of operations is.</p>
