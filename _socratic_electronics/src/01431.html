<p>An important feature of microprocessors is the use of <em>flag</em> registers. What, exactly, is a &quot;flag&quot;, and what are they used for in microprocessor programming? Identify some common machine-language commands that set flags, and some common commands that read flags.</p>
<p><em>Flags</em> are single-bit registers in a microprocessor set according to the results of an operation. Arithmetic and logical operations are common examples of commands that set flags. Conditional operations such as &quot;Jump if Zero&quot; are based on flag status: that is, the status of certain flags dictate what a conditional operation will do.</p>
<p>When I began learning microprocessor programming, I wondered how conditional operations such as JZ &quot;knew&quot; whether to jump or not. It was apparent from inspection of various programs that these conditional operations based their &quot;decision&quot; on the command immediately preceding, but I had no idea how this communicative link was made. Once I researched flags, though, it all made sense.</p>
