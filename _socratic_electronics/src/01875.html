<p>If a coil of insulated wire is wrapped around an iron core, an inductance will be formed. Even if the wire has negligible resistance, the current through the coil from an AC source will be limited by the inductive reactance (<span class="math"><em>X</em><sub><em>L</em></sub></span>) of the coil, as the magnetic flux in the iron core oscillates back and forth to induce a counter-EMF:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01875x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Plot the instantaneous magnetic flux (<span class="math"><em>ϕ</em></span>) waveform in the iron core corresponding to the instantaneous applied voltage (<span class="math"><em>v</em></span>) shown in this graph:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01875x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01875x03.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>There is a simple formula (albeit containing a derivative term) describing the relationship between instantaneous flux (<span class="math"><em>ϕ</em></span>) and instantaneous induced voltage (<span class="math"><em>v</em></span>). Your students ought to know what it is, and that it should be applied to this question!</p>
