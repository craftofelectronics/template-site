<p>Here are two ways of showing the same addition:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02100x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Follow-up question: how would you verbally explain the process of phasor addition? If you were to describe to someone else how to add phasors together, what would you tell them?</p>
<p>Discuss with your students that phasors may also be subtracted, multiplied, and divided. Subtraction is not too difficult to visualize, but addition and multiplication defies geometric understanding for many.</p>
