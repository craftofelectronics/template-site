<p>Explain how it is possible for a fault in the biasing circuitry of a transistor amplifier to completely kill the (AC) output of that amplifier. How and why can a shift in DC bias voltage have an effect on the AC signal being amplified?</p>
<p>If the DC bias voltage shifts far enough away from the normal (quiescent) levels, the transistor may be forced into saturation or cutoff so it cannot reproduce the AC signal.</p>
<p>This question asks students to explore the possibility of complete AC signal failure due to a simple shift in DC bias, based on their understanding of how transistor amplifiers function. It may seem paradoxical that such a &quot;small&quot; fault could have such a large effect on an amplifier circuit, but it should make sense once students grasp how important bias is to class-A amplifier operation.</p>
