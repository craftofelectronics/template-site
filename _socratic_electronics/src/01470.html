<p>Explain what a <em>universal</em> shift register is. The 74194 is an example of a TTL universal shift register, so you will find that datasheet very helpful in answering this question.</p>
<p>A <em>universal</em> shift register has the ability to input data in either serial or parallel form, as well as output data in either serial or parallel form.</p>
<p>Note: this answer is purposely minimal. I expect you to provide a more detailed answer during discussion, based on research of universal shift registers!</p>
<p>Regarding the point in the answer about student research, ask your students how a single shift register chip is able to perform all the different types of input/output combinations. Ask your students, for instance, how to make the 74194 act <em>only</em> as a parallel-in/parallel-out register.</p>
