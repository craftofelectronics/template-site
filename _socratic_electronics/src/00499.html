<p>In this graph of two AC voltages, which one is <em>leading</em> and which one is <em>lagging</em>?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00499x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>If the 4-volt (peak) sine wave is denoted in phasor notation as <span class="math">$4 \hbox{ V} \angle \&gt; 0^o$</span>, how should the 3-volt (peak) waveform be denoted? Express your answer in both polar and rectangular forms.</p>
<p>If the 4-volt (peak) sine wave is denoted in phasor notation as <span class="math">$4 \hbox{ V} \angle \&gt; 90^o$</span>, how should the 3-volt (peak) waveform be denoted? Express your answer in both polar and rectangular forms.</p>
<p>The 4-volt (peak) waveform <em>leads</em> the 3-volt (peak) waveform. Conversely, the 3-volt waveform <em>lags</em> behind the 4-volt waveform.</p>
<p>If the 4-volt waveform is denoted as 4 V <span class="math">∠</span> 0<span class="math">$^o$</span>, then the 3-volt waveform should be denoted as 3 V <span class="math">∠</span> -90<span class="math">$^o$</span>, or <span class="math">0 − <em>j</em>3</span> V.</p>
<p>If the 4-volt waveform is denoted as 4 V <span class="math">∠</span> 90<span class="math">$^o$</span> (<span class="math">0 + <em>j</em>4</span> V in rectangular form), then the 3-volt waveform should be denoted as 3 V <span class="math">∠</span> 0<span class="math">$^o$</span>, or <span class="math">3 + <em>j</em>0</span> V.</p>
<p>In my years of teaching, I have been surprised at how many students struggle with identifying the &quot;leading&quot; and &quot;lagging&quot; waveforms on a time-domain graph. Be sure to discuss this topic well with your students, identifying methods for correctly distinguishing &quot;leading&quot; waves from &quot;lagging&quot; waves.</p>
<p>This question also provides students with good practice expressing leading and lagging waves in phasor notation. One of the characteristics of phasors made evident in the answer is the relative nature of angles. Be sure to point this out to your students.</p>
