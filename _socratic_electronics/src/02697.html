<p>How much current (<span class="math"><em>I</em></span>) would have to be forced through the resistor in order to generate an output voltage of 5 volts?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02697x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math"><em>I</em></span> = 2.273 mA</p>
<p>The purpose of this question, besides giving students reason to review a current-to-voltage converter opamp circuit, is to preview the behavior of an active differentiator using the same resistor and output voltage values (question #02698).</p>
