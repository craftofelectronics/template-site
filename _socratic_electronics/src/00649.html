<p>Identify the type of electronic instrument that displays the relative amplitudes of a range of signal frequencies on a graph, with amplitude on the vertical axis and frequency on the horizontal.</p>
<p>A <em>spectrum analyzer</em>.</p>
<p>Challenge questions: two similar instruments are the <em>wave analyzer</em> and the <em>Fourier analyzer</em>. Explain how both these instruments are similar in function to a spectrum analyzer, and also how both differ.</p>
<p>Spectrum analyzers capable of analyzing radio-frequency signals are very expensive, but low-cost personal computer hardware and software does a good job of analyzing complex audio signals. It would be a benefit to your class to have a low-frequency spectrum analyzer setup available for student use, and possible demonstration during discussion.</p>
