<p>Calculate the total impedance for these two 100 mH inductors at 2.3 kHz, and draw a phasor diagram showing circuit impedances (<span class="math"><em>Z</em><sub><em>t</em><em>o</em><em>t</em><em>a</em><em>l</em></sub></span>, <span class="math"><em>R</em></span>, and <span class="math"><em>X</em></span>):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02080x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Now, re-calculate impedance and re-draw the phasor impedance diagram supposing the second inductor is replaced by a 1.5 k<span class="math">Ω </span> resistor:</p>

<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02080x03.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02080x04.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Phasor diagrams are powerful analytical tools, if one knows how to draw and interpret them. With hand calculators being so powerful and readily able to handle complex numbers in either polar or rectangular form, there is temptation to avoid phasor diagrams and let the calculator handle all the angle manipulation. However, students will have a much better understanding of phasors and complex numbers in AC circuits if you hold them accountable to representing quantities in that form.</p>
