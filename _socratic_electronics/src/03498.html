<p>When engineers and physicists draw pictures illustrating the magnetic field produced by a straight current-carrying wire, they usually do so using this notation:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03498x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Explain what the circle-and-dot and circle-and-cross symbols mean, with reference to the <em>right-hand rule</em>.</p>
<p>The circles with dots show the magnetic flux vectors coming at you from out of the paper. The circles with crosses show the magnetic flux vectors going away from you into the paper. Think of these as images of arrows with points (dots) and fletchings (crosses).</p>
<p>As a follow-up to this question, you might wish to draw current-carrying wires at different angles, and with current moving in different directions, as practice problems for your students to draw the corresponding arrow points and tails.</p>
