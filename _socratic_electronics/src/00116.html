<p>How long will it take for the light bulb to receive electrical power once the battery is connected to the rest of the circuit?</p>

<p>Approximately 11 milliseconds (0.0107 seconds).</p>
<p>Electricity is fast: the effects of electron motion travel at approximately the speed of light (186,000 miles per second). Actual average electron velocity, on the other hand, is very, very slow. A convenient analogy I’ve used to illustrate how electrons may move slowly yet have rapid effect is that of a closed-loop hydraulic system. When the valve is opened, fluid motion throughout the system is immediate (actually, the motion progresses at the speed of sound through the fluid – very fast!), yet the actual velocity of fluid motion is much slower.</p>
<p>Incidentally, the double-chevron symbols indicate an electrical connector pair (plug and jack; male and female).</p>
