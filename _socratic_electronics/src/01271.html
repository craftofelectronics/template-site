<p>Suppose that a CMOS inverting buffer gate were to drive a predominantly inductive load, such as a small relay coil:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01271x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Normally, it would be considered good design practice to connect a commutating diode in parallel with the relay coil, to prevent high-voltage transients when the coil is de-energized. However, this is not necessary when a CMOS gate drives a coil. Explain why.</p>
<p>If you thought the answer to this question was, &quot;because MOSFET transistors are immune to damage from high-voltage transients,&quot; you were wrong. If anything, MOSFETs are even more susceptible to damage from high-voltage transients than BJTs, given their thinly insulated gates.</p>
<p>The correct answer has to do with the <em>bilateral</em> (non polarity-sensitive) nature of MOSFETs when conducting. Trace the direction of current through the relay coil while energized, and at the point in time when the gate output switches to a &quot;low&quot; state, and you will understand why no commutating diode is necessary in this circuit.</p>
<p>By examining one of the ancillary benefits of using CMOS instead of TTL, students get a good review of inductor and transistor theory. Ask your students to explain why a TTL gate <em>would</em> require the relay coil to have a commutating diode, lest the gate be destroyed by inductive &quot;kickback.&quot;</p>
