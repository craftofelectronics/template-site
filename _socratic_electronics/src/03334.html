<p>At your desk, choose a resistor from your parts kit with the following resistance value:</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>R</em> = </span></p>
<p>Calculate how much current will go through this resistor when connected to a voltage source with the following value:</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>V</em> = </span> <span class="math"><em>I</em></span> (predicted) =</p>
<p>Moving from your desk to the test bench, adjust the power supply to the specified voltage value (using your multimeter to verify the output voltage), connect the resistor to this power supply, and use your multimeter to measure the actual resistor current:</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>I</em></span> (measured) =</p>
<p>Use circuit simulation software to verify your predicted and measured parameter values.</p>
