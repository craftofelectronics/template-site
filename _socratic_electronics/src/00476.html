<p>Suppose this circuit was found to output a voltage of 11.0 volts, given the input voltages shown:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00476x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math"><em>V</em><sub>1</sub> = </span> 8.5 volts</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>V</em><sub>2</sub> = </span> 10.0 volts</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>V</em><sub>3</sub> = </span> 12.0 volts</p>
<p>What do suspect is wrong with this circuit? How would you verify the cause of the incorrect output voltage?</p>
<p>The upper resistor is failed open.</p>
<p>Note how even with a failed resistor, the circuit still performs the proper mathematical function (albeit, only regarding two of the input &quot;channels&quot; rather than three). Ask your students how they determined the source of the problem, and how they would verify that as being the fault, with just a single meter measurement.</p>
