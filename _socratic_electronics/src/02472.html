<p>What possible benefit is there to adding a voltage buffer to the front end of an inverting amplifier, as shown in the following schematic?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02472x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The voltage buffer raises the amplifierâ€™s input impedance without altering voltage gain.</p>
<p>Discuss with your students how this is very common: using a voltage buffer as an impedance transformation (or <em>isolation</em>) device so that a weak (high-impedance) source is able to drive an amplifier.</p>
