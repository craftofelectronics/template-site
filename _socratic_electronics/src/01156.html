<p>Find a magnet and bring it with you to class for discussion. Identify as much information as you can about your magnet prior to discussion:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Location of poles</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Which pole is North, and which pole is South</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Type (metal, ceramic, etc.)</p>
<p>Please be careful to keep any magnets away from cassette tapes, computer disks, credit cards (with magnetic information strips) or any other form of magnetic media!</p>
<p>If possible, find a manufacturer’s datasheet for your component (or at least a datasheet for a similar component) to discuss with your classmates.</p>
<p>Be prepared to explain to your classmates how you were able to determine the polarity (North and South) of your magnet!</p>
<p>The purpose of this question is to get students to kinesthetically interact with the subject matter. It may seem silly to have students engage in a &quot;show and tell&quot; exercise, but I have found that activities such as this greatly help some students. For those learners who are kinesthetic in nature, it is a great help to actually <em>touch</em> real components while they’re learning about their function.</p>
<p>Another good learning experience with this question is how your students determined the polarity of their magnet.</p>
