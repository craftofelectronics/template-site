<p>Thévenin’s theorem is a powerful tool for analyzing R-2R ladder networks. Take for instance this four-section network where the next-to-most-significant &quot;bit&quot; is activated, while all the other &quot;bits&quot; are inactive (switched to ground):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{04001x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>If we Thévenize all sections to the left of the activated section, replacing it with a single resistance to ground, we see the network becomes far simpler:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{04001x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Explain how we may apply Thévenin’s theorem once again to the shaded section of this next circuit (simplified from the previous circuit shown above) to simplify it even more, obtaining a final result for <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>o</em><em>u</em><em>t</em></sub></span>:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{04001x03.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Once you get to this point, solving for <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>o</em><em>u</em><em>t</em></sub></span> in terms of <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>r</em><em>e</em><em>f</em></sub></span> is trivial:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{04001x04.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Students might not realize it is valid to iteratively apply Thévenin’s theorem to the solution of a circuit problem. You can, and this stands as a good example of how (and why!) you should do it.</p>
