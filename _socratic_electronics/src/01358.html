<p>An <em>analog-to-digital converter</em> is a circuit that inputs a variable (analog) voltage or current, and outputs multiple bits of binary data corresponding to the magnitude of that measured voltage or current. In the circuit shown here, an ADC inputs a voltage signal from a potentiometer, and outputs an 8-bit binary &quot;word,&quot; which may then be read by a computer, transmitted digitally over a communications network, or stored on digital media:</p>

<p>As the input voltage changes, the binary number output by the ADC will change as well. Suppose, though, that we want to have <em>sample-and-hold</em> capability added to this data acquisition circuit, to allow us to &quot;freeze&quot; the output of the ADC at will. Explain how using eight D latch circuits will give us this capability:</p>

<p>When the Sample/Hold switch is in the &quot;low&quot; position, the D latches all fall into the &quot;latch&quot; state, holding that last valid input states on their Q outputs.</p>
<p>Sample-and-hold circuitry is quite common in modern data acquisition and other types of electronic systems. In this case, sample-and-hold showcases a practical use of D latch circuits. If your students have not yet heard of analog-to-digital converters, it might be a good idea to discuss some of their general principles. No knowledge of their internal workings is necessary in order to comprehend the circuit shown in the question, however.</p>
