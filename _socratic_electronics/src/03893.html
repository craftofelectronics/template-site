<p>Identify at least one component fault that would cause the final 555 timer output to always remain low:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03893x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>For each of your proposed faults, explain <em>why</em> it will cause the described problem.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> failed open.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Solder bridge past resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span>.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> No power to either 555 timer IC.</p>
<p>Be sure to discuss the reasons why each of your students’ proposed component faults would cause the final output to never go high. The possibilities range from the obvious to the obscure, and exploring them will strengthen your students’ understanding of the 555 as a monostable multivibrator.</p>
