<p>Determine what status the LED will be in (either &quot;on&quot; or &quot;off&quot;) for both switch positions in this JFET switching circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02093x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The switch is shown in the &quot;LED on&quot; position.</p>
<p>Ask your students to explain their reasoning for their switch position determinations.</p>
