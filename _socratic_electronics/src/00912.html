<p>In extrinsic semiconductors, what are <em>majority carriers</em> and how do they differ from <em>minority carriers</em>?</p>
<p>&quot;Majority carriers&quot; are those charge carriers existing by the purposeful addition of doping elements to the material. &quot;Minority carriers&quot; are the opposite type of charge carrier, inhabiting a semiconductor only because it is impossible to completely eliminate the impurities generating them.</p>
<p>We speak of pure semiconductor materials, and of &quot;doping&quot; pieces of semiconductor material with just the right quantity and type(s) of dopants, but the reality is it is impossible to assure perfect quality control, and thus there <em>will</em> be other impurities in any semiconductor sample.</p>
<p>Ask your students to specifically identify the majority and minority charge carriers for &quot;P&quot; and &quot;N&quot; type extrinsic semiconductors. In each case, are they electrons, or holes?</p>
