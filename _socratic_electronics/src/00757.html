<p>It is very important that the secondary winding of a <em>current transformer</em> (CT) never be open-circuited while in operation! Explain why this is an important safety consideration.</p>
<p>An open-circuited secondary winding on a current transformer is capable of generating <em>extremely</em> high voltages.</p>
<p>There are a couple of different ways to explain <em>why</em> current transformers pose this safety hazard. One could explain it in terms of the winding ratio, or perhaps in terms of its function as an AC &quot;current source&quot;. Do not be surprised if your students present multiple explanations for this behavior.</p>
