<p>In this circuit, three common AC loads are represented as resistances, combined with reactive components in two out of the three cases. Calculate the amount of true power (<span class="math"><em>P</em></span>), apparent power (<span class="math"><em>S</em></span>), reactive power (<span class="math"><em>Q</em></span>), and power factor (<span class="math"><em>P</em><em>F</em></span>) for each of the loads:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00772x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Also, draw power triangle diagrams for each circuit, showing how the true, apparent, and reactive powers trigonometrically relate.</p>
<p>Fluorescent lamp: <span class="math"><em>P</em> = </span> 60 W ; <span class="math"><em>Q</em> = </span> 54.3 VAR ; <span class="math"><em>S</em> = </span> 80.9 VA ; <span class="math"><em>P</em><em>F</em> = </span> 0.74, leading</p>
<p>Incandescent lamp: <span class="math"><em>P</em> = </span> 60 W ; <span class="math"><em>Q</em> = </span> 0 VAR ; <span class="math"><em>S</em> = </span> 60 VA ; <span class="math"><em>P</em><em>F</em> = </span> 1.0</p>
<p>Induction motor: <span class="math"><em>P</em> = </span> 52.0 W ; <span class="math"><em>Q</em> = </span> 20.4 VAR ; <span class="math"><em>S</em> = </span> 55.8 VA ; <span class="math"><em>P</em><em>F</em> = </span> 0.93, lagging</p>
<p>Your students should realize that the only dissipative element in each load is the resistor. Inductors and capacitors, being reactive components, do not actually dissipate power.</p>
<p>Ask your students how the &quot;excess&quot; current drawn by each load potentially influences the size of wire needed to carry power to that load. Suppose the impedance of each load were 100 times less, resulting in 100 times as much current for each load. Would the &quot;extra&quot; current be significant then?</p>
<p>Being that most heavy AC loads happen to be strongly inductive in nature (large electric motors, electromagnets, and the &quot;leakage&quot; inductance intrinsic to large transformers), what does this mean for AC power systems in general?</p>
