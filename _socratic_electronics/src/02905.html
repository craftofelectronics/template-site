<p>What purpose do resistors <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span> serve, and why are they so large (1,000,000 ohms each)?</p>
<p>If they were not in the circuit, the logic probe would indicate a &quot;high&quot; condition with the probe floating. In place, the resistors force an &quot;indeterminate&quot; state with a floating probe.</p>
<p>A less obvious feature of these resistors is that they force the circuit under test to drive a bit of current to (or from) the probe. This is good, as it may help to show a gate with a &quot;weak&quot; output, such as one that is mildly overloaded. Lower values for <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span> would accentuate this feature, but would also make it trickier to set the high/low threshold potentiometers (<span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>p</em><em>o</em><em>t</em>1</sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>p</em><em>o</em><em>t</em>2</sub></span>).</p>
<p>Another not-so-obvious design feature is that resistors <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span> establish a default input voltage level that is between the two threshold settings established by the potentiometers. In my first design, I connected <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span> to the power supply rails, respectively. This set the default (floating) input voltage at <span class="math">${1 \over 2} V$</span>, which worked fine for CMOS logic levels but not for TTL. By having the resistors set a default input voltage between the two threshold adjustments, a floating probe is guaranteed to indicate &quot;indeterminate&quot; no matter where the threshold potentiometers are set.</p>
