<p>By visual inspection, determine which of the following waveforms contain even-numbered harmonics:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01894x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Note that only one cycle is shown for each waveform. Remember that we’re dealing with continuous waveforms, endlessly repeating, and not single cycles as you see here.</p>
<p>The following waveforms contain even-numbered harmonics: <strong>B</strong>, <strong>C</strong>, <strong>D</strong>, <strong>F</strong>, and <strong>I</strong>. The rest only contain odd harmonics of the fundamental.</p>
<p>Ask your students how they were able to discern the presence of even-numbered harmonics by visual inspection. This typically proves difficult for some of my students whose spatial-relations skills are weak. These students need some sort of algorithmic (step-by-step) procedure to see what other students see immediately, and discussion time is a great opportunity for students to share technique.</p>
<p>Mathematically, this symmetry is defined as such:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$f(t) = -f \left(t + {T \over 2} \right)$</span><br /></p>
<p>Where,</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>f</em>(<em>t</em>) = </span> Function of waveform with time as the independent variable</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>t</em> = </span> Time</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>T</em> = </span> Period of waveform, in same units of time as <span class="math"><em>t</em></span></p>
