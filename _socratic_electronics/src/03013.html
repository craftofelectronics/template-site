<p>The 74HC137 and 74HC237 decoder/demultiplexer integrated circuits have a feature that some other decoder/demultiplexers do not: <em>address latching</em>. Explain what this additional feature is, how it works, and how you would disable the feature if you needed to use one of these integrated circuits in an application not requiring address latching.</p>
<p>I’ll let you figure out the answers to this question. The manufacturers’ datasheet, of course, is probably your best source of information!</p>
<p>Follow-up question: what is the functional difference between the 74HC137 and the 74HC237? How would the respective schematic symbols for these two decoder/demux ICs differ?</p>
<p>Challenge question: think of a practical application where you might need the feature of address latching.</p>
<p>The feature of address latching is not hard to understand if students have already studied D-type latches (and/or parallel-in/parallel-out shift registers).</p>
