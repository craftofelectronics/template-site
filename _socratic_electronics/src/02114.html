<p>A technician needs to know the value of a capacitor, but does not have a capacitance meter nearby. In lieu of this, the technician sets up the following circuit to measure capacitance:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02114x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>You happen to walk by this technician’s workbench and ask, &quot;How does this measurement setup work?&quot; The technician responds, &quot;You connect a resistor of known value (<span class="math"><em>R</em></span>) in series with the capacitor of unknown value (<span class="math"><em>C</em><sub><em>x</em></sub></span>), then adjust the generator frequency until the oscilloscope shows the two voltage drops to be equal, and then you calculate <span class="math"><em>C</em><sub><em>x</em></sub></span>.&quot;</p>
<p>Explain how this system works, in your own words. Also, write the formula you would use to calculate the value of <span class="math"><em>C</em><sub><em>x</em></sub></span> given <span class="math"><em>f</em></span> and <span class="math"><em>R</em></span>.</p>
<p>I’ll let you figure out how to explain the operation of this test setup. The formula you would use looks like this:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$C_x = {1 \over {2 \pi f R}}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Follow-up question: could you use a similar setup to measure the inductance of an unknown inductor <span class="math"><em>L</em><sub><em>x</em></sub></span>? Why or why not?</p>
<p>Challenge question: astute observers will note that this setup might not work in real life because the ground connection of the oscilloscope is <em>not</em> common with one of the function generator’s leads. Explain why this might be a problem, and suggest a practical solution for it.</p>
<p>This method of measuring capacitance (or inductance for that matter) is fairly old, and works well if the unknown component has a high <span class="math"><em>Q</em></span> value.</p>
