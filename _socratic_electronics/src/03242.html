<p>Use Thévenin’s Theorem to determine a simple equivalent circuit for the 3 mA source, the 8 k<span class="math">Ω </span> resistor, and the 3.3 k<span class="math">Ω </span> resistor; then calculate the voltage across the 1 k<span class="math">Ω </span> load:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03242x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>l</em><em>o</em><em>a</em><em>d</em></sub></span> = 2.756 volts</p>
<p>Follow-up question: although analyzing this circuit by series-parallel analysis is probably easier than using Thévenin’s Theorem, there is definite value to doing it the way this question instructs when considering many different load resistance possibilities. Explain why this is.</p>
<p>Ask your students to show how (step-by-step) they arrived at the equivalent circuit, prior to calculating load voltage.</p>
<p>In case students are unfamiliar with the &quot;double-chevron&quot; symbols in the schematic diagram, let them know that these represent male/female connector pairs.</p>
