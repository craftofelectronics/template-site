<p>Many resistors have their electrical resistance shown by a set of color codes, or &quot;bands,&quot; imprinted around their circumference. A standard color code associates each color with a specific decimal digit (0 through 9). Associate each of the following digits with its respective color:</p>
<p>0 =</p>
<p>1 =</p>
<p>2 =</p>
<p>3 =</p>
<p>4 =</p>
<p>5 =</p>
<p>6 =</p>
<p>7 =</p>
<p>8 =</p>
<p>9 =</p>
<p>0 = Black</p>
<p>1 = Brown</p>
<p>2 = Red</p>
<p>3 = Orange</p>
<p>4 = Yellow</p>
<p>5 = Green</p>
<p>6 = Blue</p>
<p>7 = Violet</p>
<p>8 = Grey</p>
<p>9 = White</p>
<p>Several limericks have been invented to remember this color code, most of them &quot;politically incorrect.&quot; I often challenge students to invent their own limericks for remembering this color code, and screen the inappropriate creations from general class discussion.</p>
