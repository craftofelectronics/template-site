<p>What is <em>specific resistance</em>, symbolized by the Greek letter &quot;rho&quot; (<span class="math"><em>ρ</em></span>)?</p>
<p>Specific resistance is a measure of how resistive any particular substance is, relative to its length and cross-sectional area.</p>
<p>Ask your students, &quot;Why is it important to have a quantity called <em>specific</em> resistance? Why don’t we just compare the &quot;resistivity&quot; of different substances in regular units of ohms?</p>
