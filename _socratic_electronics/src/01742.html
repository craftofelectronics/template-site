<p>In this circuit there is at least one ammeter that is not reading correctly:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01742x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Apply Kirchhoff’s Current Law to this circuit to prove why all three current measurements shown here cannot be correct.</p>
<p>Kirchhoff’s Current Law renders this scenario impossible: &quot;the algebraic sum of all currents at a node <em>must</em> be zero.&quot;</p>
<p>Another way of stating KCL is to say, &quot;What goes in must come out.&quot; When continuous DC currents are involved, this law is really nothing more than a restatement of the Conservation of Charge. Of course, there are transient exceptions to this law (static electric charge and discharge, for example) as well as interesting AC exceptions (current &quot;through&quot; a capacitor), so a hard-literal interpretation of KCL may cause confusion later one. However, it is a fairly intuitive Law to grasp, and consequently I seldom find students experiencing difficulty with it.</p>
