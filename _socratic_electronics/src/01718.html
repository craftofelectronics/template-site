<p>Identify which of these circuits is a <em>parallel</em> circuit (there may be more than one shown!):</p>

<p>Circuits <strong>D</strong> and <strong>E</strong> are <em>parallel</em> circuits.</p>
<p>The purpose of this question is to get students to identify what distinguishing characteristic uniquely identifies a circuit as being &quot;parallel.&quot; Once this has been identified, there are several conclusions which may be deduced (regarding voltage drops, currents, resistances, etc.).</p>
<p>Some students may have difficulty distinguishing that circuit <strong>E</strong> is a parallel circuit, but it is!</p>
