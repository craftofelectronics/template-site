<p>We know that an opamp connected to a voltage divider with a voltage division ratio of <span class="math">$1 \over 2$</span> will have an overall voltage gain of 2, and that the same circuit with a voltage division ratio of <span class="math">$2 \over 3$</span> will have an overall voltage gain of 1.5, or <span class="math">$3 \over 2$</span>:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02464x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>There is definitely a mathematical pattern at work in these noninverting opamp circuits: the overall voltage gain of the circuit is the <em>mathematical inverse</em> of the feedback network’s voltage gain.</p>
<p>Building on this concept, what do you think would be the overall function of the following opamp circuits?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02464x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\hbox{For the left-hand circuit: \hskip 20pt} V_{out} = V_{in} - 4$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\hbox{For the right-hand circuit: \hskip 20pt} V_{out} = \sqrt{V_{in}}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The result of placing a mathematical function in the feedback loop of a noninverting opamp circuit is that the output becomes the inverse function of the input: it literally becomes the value of <span class="math"><em>x</em></span> needed to solve for the input value of <span class="math"><em>y</em></span>:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02464x03.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>What is shown in this question and answer is a stark example of the power of negative feedback in a mathematical system. Here, we see the opamp’s ability to solve for the input variable in an equation which we know the output value of. To state this in simpler terms, the opamp &quot;does algebra&quot; for us by &quot;manipulating&quot; the feedback network’s equation to solve for <span class="math"><em>x</em></span> given an input signal of <span class="math"><em>y</em></span>.</p>
