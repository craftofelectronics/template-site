<p>What would happen if a wire having no resistance at all (0 <span class="math">Ω </span>) were connected directly across the terminals of a 6-volt battery? How much current would result, according to Ohm’s Law?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00106x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Suppose we were to short-circuit a 6-volt battery in the manner just described and measure 8 amps of current. Why don’t the calculated figures from the previous paragraph agree with the actual measurement?</p>
<p>Ohm’s Law would suggest an infinite current (current = voltage divided by zero resistance). Yet, the experiment described yields only a modest amount of current.</p>
<p>If you think that the wire used in the experiment is not resistance-less (i.e. it <em>does</em> have resistance), and that this accounts for the disparity between the predicted and measured amounts of current, you are partially correct. Realistically, a small piece of wire such as that used in the experiment will have a few tenths of an ohm of resistance. However, if you re-calculate current with a wire resistance of 0.1 <span class="math">Ω </span>, you will still find a large disparity between your prediction and the actual measured current in this short-circuit.</p>
<p>Follow-up question #1: explain why wire resistance alone does not explain the modest short-circuit current.</p>
<p>Follow-up question #2: identify at least one safety hazard associated with a real experiment such as this.</p>
<p>Remind students that short-circuit testing of electrical power sources can be dangerous. A student of mine once stuffed a 6-volt &quot;lantern&quot; battery in his tool pouch, only to have it discharge smoke an hour later, after the battery terminals had been shorted together by a wrench handle!</p>
<p>No, Ohm’s Law is not being cheated here: shorting a voltage source with a 0 <span class="math">Ω </span> conductor will not result in infinite current, because there are <em>other</em> sources of resistance in such a circuit. The task here is to determine where those sources might be, and how they could be located.</p>
