<p>Suppose that an electric heater, which is nothing more than a large resistor, dissipates 500 watts of power when directly connected to a 110 volt source:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03252x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Now suppose that exact same heater is connected to one end of a long two-wire cable, which is then connected to the same 110 volt source. Assuming that each conductor within the cable has an end-to-end resistance of 3 ohms, how much power will the heater dissipate?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03252x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math"><em>P</em></span> = 321.1 watts</p>
<p>The purpose of this question, besides providing a good problem-solving exercise for students, is to get them to realize one of the practical implications of power-line resistance.</p>
