<p>Potentiometers are manufactured in two different &quot;tapers&quot;: <em>linear</em> and <em>audio</em>. Linear taper potentiometers provide a direct, linear relationship between wiper position and resistance division, so that equal changes in wiper position result in equal changes in resistance. Audio taper potentiometers provide a non-linear (logarithmic, to be exact) relationship between wiper position and resistance division, so that the same amount of wiper motion at one end of its range gives a much greater change in resistance than at the other end of its range.</p>

<p>Suppose you have a potentiometer, but do not know whether it has a linear or audio taper. How could you determine this, using a meter?</p>
<p>A linear taper potentiometer will exhibit resistance measurements between the wiper and the other two terminals, proportional to the wiper position.</p>
<p>Discuss with your students the purpose of an audio taper potentiometer: to provide logarithmically proportioned increases in audio power for volume control applications. This is necessary for a &quot;proportional&quot; response when turning the volume knob on an audio amplifier, since human hearing is not linear, but logarithmic in its detection of loudness. In order to generate a sound that the human ear perceives as twice as loud, ten times as much sound power is necessary.</p>
<p>A challenging question to ask your students is <em>which way</em> an audio taper potentiometer should be connected as a voltage divider in an audio amplifier circuit. Being that audio taper potentiometers are non-symmetrical, it truly matters which way they are connected!</p>
