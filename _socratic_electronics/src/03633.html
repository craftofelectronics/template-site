<p>There are many ways to make a resonant LC circuit &quot;tunable&quot; so that its resonant frequency may be varied. One way is to provide the inductor with a movable core:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03633x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Determine which way the core needs to move (<em>up</em> or <em>down</em>) to <em>decrease</em> the resonant frequency of this LC circuit, and explain why this is so. Be sure to include the concept of <em>magnetic permeability</em> in your explanation.</p>
<p>Moving the core material <em>down</em> (closer to the wire coil) increases the <em>magnetic permeability</em> of the inductor, thus increasing the magnetic flux generated for any given amount of current through the coil, thus increasing its inductance, thus decreasing the resonant frequency of the LC circuit.</p>
