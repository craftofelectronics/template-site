<p>Explain the principle of operation in this <em>astable multivibrator</em> circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01079x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Also, identify where you would connect to this circuit to obtain an output signal. What type of signal would it be (sine wave, square wave, ramp or triangle wave, etc.)?</p>
<p>A square-wave output signal may be obtained at the collector of either transistor. I’ll let you research this circuit’s principle of operation.</p>
<p>Ask your students to explain how the frequency of this circuit could be altered. After that, ask them what they would have to do to alter the <em>duty cycle</em> of this circuit’s oscillation.</p>
