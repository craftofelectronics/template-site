<p>Real inductors and capacitors are never purely reactive. There will inevitably be some resistance intrinsic to these devices as well.</p>
<p>Suppose an inductor has 57 <span class="math">Ω </span> of winding resistance, and 1500 <span class="math">Ω </span> of reactance at a particular frequency. How would this combination be expressed as a single impedance? State your answer in both polar and rectangular forms.</p>
<p><span class="math">${\bf Z_L} =$</span> 1501 <span class="math">Ω </span> <span class="math">∠</span> 87.8<span class="math">$^{o}$</span> = 57 + j1500 <span class="math">Ω </span></p>
<p>Mention to your students that &quot;real&quot; components such as this may be modeled in a diagram as a combination of two &quot;pure&quot; components, in this case a resistor and an inductor. Discuss with them the benefits of &quot;modeling&quot; component characteristics in this manner, since it is a very common practice in engineering.</p>
<p>This is a very important concept to understand: that reactive components are never <em>purely</em> reactive. Parasitic resistance is impossible to avoid short of using superconductors. Even then, inductors are bound to have some parasitic capacitance, and capacitors are bound to have some parasitic inductance!</p>
