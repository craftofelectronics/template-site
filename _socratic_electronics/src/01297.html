<p><em>Boolean algebra</em> is a strange sort of math. For example, the complete set of rules for Boolean addition is as follows:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">0 + 0 = 0</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">0 + 1 = 1</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">1 + 0 = 1</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">1 + 1 = 1</span><br /></p>
<p>Suppose a student saw this for the very first time, and was quite puzzled by it. What would you say to him or her as an explanation for this? How in the world can <span class="math">1 + 1 = 1</span> and not 2? And why are there no more rules for Boolean addition? Where is the rule for <span class="math">1 + 2</span> or <span class="math">2 + 2</span>?</p>
<p>Boolean quantities can only have one out of two possible values: either 0 or 1. There is no such thing as &quot;2&quot; in the set of Boolean numbers.</p>
<p>Boolean algebra is a strange math, indeed. However, once students understand the limited scope of Boolean quantities, the rationale for Boolean rules of arithmetic make sense. 1 + 1 <em>must</em> equal 1, because there is no such thing as &quot;2&quot; in the Boolean world, and the answer certainly can’t be 0.</p>
