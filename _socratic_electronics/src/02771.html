<p>Calculate the necessary values of <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span> to limit the minimum and maximum voltage gain of this opamp circuit to 10 and 85, respectively:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02771x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> = 2 k<span class="math">Ω </span></p>
<p><span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span> = 153 k<span class="math">Ω </span></p>
<p>This is a very practical example of using simultaneous equations in analog circuit design. A common mistake students make while setting up the equations is forgetting that a noninverting amplifier’s gain is the ratio of the feedback and grounding resistors, <em>plus one!</em></p>
