<p>The Fourier series for a square wave is as follows:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$v_{square} = {4 \over \pi}V_m \left(\sin \omega t + {1 \over 3}\sin 3 \omega t + {1 \over 5}\sin 5 \omega t + {1 \over 7} \sin 7 \omega t + \cdots + {1 \over n} \sin n \omega t \right)$</span><br /></p>
<p>Where,</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>m</em></sub></span> = Peak amplitude of square wave</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>ω</em></span> = Angular velocity of square wave (equal to <span class="math">2<em>π</em><em>f</em></span>, where <span class="math"><em>f</em></span> is the fundamental frequency)</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>n</em></span> = An odd integer</p>
<p>Electrically, we might represent a square-wave voltage source as a circle with a square-wave symbol inside, like this:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02260x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Knowing the Fourier series of this voltage, however, allows us to represent the same voltage source as a set of series-connected voltage sources, each with its own (sinusoidal) frequency. Draw the equivalent schematic for a 10 volt (peak), 200 Hz square-wave source in this manner showing only the first four harmonics, labeling each sinusoidal voltage source with its own RMS voltage value and frequency:</p>
<p>Hint: <span class="math"><em>ω</em> = 2<em>π</em><em>f</em></span></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02260x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>To be honest, the four-harmonic equivalent circuit is a rather poor approximation for a square wave. The real purpose of this question, though, is to have students relate the sinusoidal terms of a common Fourier series (for a square wave) to a schematic diagram, translating between angular velocity and frequency, peak values and RMS values.</p>
<p>Please note that the voltage magnitudes shown in the answer are <em>RMS</em> and not peak! If you were to calculate peak sinusoid source values, you would obtain these results:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> 1st harmonic: <span class="math">${40 \over \pi}$</span> volts peak = 12.73 volts peak</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> 3rd harmonic: <span class="math">${40 \over {3 \pi}}$</span> volts peak = 4.244 volts peak</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> 5th harmonic: <span class="math">${40 \over {5 \pi}}$</span> volts peak = 2.546 volts peak</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> 7th harmonic: <span class="math">${40 \over {7 \pi}}$</span> volts peak = 1.819 volts peak</p>
