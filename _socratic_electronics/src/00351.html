<p>Determine the current through battery #2 in this power system, if the generator is outputting 50 amps, battery #1 is charging at a rate of 22 amps, and the light bulbs draw 5 amps of current each. Be sure to indicate whether battery #2 is charging or discharging:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00351x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Battery #2 is charging at a rate of 13 amps.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most difficult portion of this question for students to figure out is which way current goes when a battery is charging, versus when it is discharging. Thus, it is a good review for students on secondary battery theory!</p>
<p>Another challenge for students might be where to label a &quot;node&quot; for the algebraic summation of currents. Do not simply tell them, but rather let them choose the node.</p>
