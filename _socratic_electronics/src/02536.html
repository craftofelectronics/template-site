<p>In this circuit, one amplifier feeds into an <em>attenuator</em> circuit, which then feeds into a second amplifier stage. Calculate the &quot;gain&quot; of the attenuator, and then calculate the overall voltage gain of this three-stage circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02536x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Also, convert the voltage gains of each stage into units of decibels, then convert the overall voltage gain ratio into units of decibels as well.</p>
<p>What do you notice about the overall gain of this circuit in relation to the individual amplifier gains, compared as ratios versus compared as decibel figures?</p>
<p>Cascaded voltage gains expressed as ratios:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$A_{V} = 5 \times \left( {1 \over 2} \right) \times 4 = 10$</span><br /></p>
<p>Cascaded voltage gains expressed a decibel figures:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$A_{V} = 13.98 \hbox{ dB} + (-6.02 \hbox{ dB}) + 12.04 = 20 \hbox{ dB}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Besides providing practice with ratio-to-decibel conversions, the purpose of this question is for students to realize that gains multiply as ratios but add as decibels.</p>
