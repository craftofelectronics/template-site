<p>A <em>strain gauge</em> is a device used to measure the strain (compression or expansion) of a solid object by producing a resistance change proportional to the amount of strain. As the gauge is strained, its electrical resistance alters slightly due to changes in wire cross-section and length.</p>
<p>The following strain gauge is shown connected in a &quot;quarter-bridge&quot; circuit (meaning only one-quarter of the bridge actively senses strain, while the other three-quarters of the bridge are fixed in resistance):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00547x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Explain what would happen to the voltage measured across this bridge circuit (<span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>A</em><em>B</em></sub></span>) if the strain gauge were to be <em>compressed</em>, assuming that the bridge begins in a balanced condition with no strain on the gauge.</p>
<p>The bridge circuit will become more unbalanced, with more strain experienced by the strain gauge. I will not tell you what the voltmeterâ€™s <em>polarity</em> will be, however!</p>
<p>Be sure to have your students explain how they arrived at their answers for polarity across the voltmeter terminals. This is the most important part of the question!</p>
