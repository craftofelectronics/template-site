<p>Write the Boolean expression for each of these logic gates, showing how the output (<span class="math"><em>Q</em></span>) algebraically relates to the inputs (<span class="math"><em>A</em></span> and <span class="math"><em>B</em></span>):</p>

<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02778x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>In order to familiarize students with Boolean algebra and how it relates to logic gate circuitry, I like to give them daily practice with questions such as this. Students need to be able to recognize these logic gate types at a glance, and also be able to associate the proper Boolean expression with each one, or else they will have difficulty analyzing logic circuits later on.</p>
