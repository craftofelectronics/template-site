<p>Use circuit simulation software to verify your predicted and measured parameter values.</p>
<p>Use an audio frequency impedance matching (1000:8 ohms) transformer for this exercise, using a load resistance great enough not to overload the signal generator powering it. I recommend using a 100 k<span class="math">Ω </span> resistor for the load. With the audio transformer’s impedance ratio, this should appear as an 800 <span class="math">Ω </span> load to the signal generator. Avoid frequencies below 1 kHz – power line frequency is much too low for this type of transformer.</p>
<p>An extension of this exercise is to incorporate troubleshooting questions. Whether using this exercise as a performance assessment or simply as a concept-building lab, you might want to follow up your students’ results by asking them to predict the consequences of certain circuit faults.</p>
