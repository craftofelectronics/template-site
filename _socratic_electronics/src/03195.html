<p>What shape of voltage waveform would you expect to measure (using an oscilloscope) across capacitor <span class="math"><em>C</em><sub>1</sub></span>? How does this waveform interact with the DC reference voltage at the wiper of <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>p</em><em>o</em><em>t</em>2</sub></span> to produce a pulse-width modulated square wave output?</p>
<p>The waveform will be a &quot;sawtooth&quot; shape. When compared against the DC reference voltage at <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>p</em><em>o</em><em>t</em>2</sub></span>’s wiper by the LM339 comparator IC, the result is a square wave of varying duty cycle.</p>
<p>Many students will initially be puzzled by the operating principle of this circuit. The best way I have found to answer their questions, I have found, is with a multi-trace oscilloscope (preferably one that can show three traces simultaneously). Connect one channel to the top of <span class="math"><em>C</em><sub>1</sub></span>, the next channel to <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>p</em><em>o</em><em>t</em>2</sub></span>’s wiper, and the third to the comparator’s output terminal. A picture, as they say, is worth a thousand words.</p>
