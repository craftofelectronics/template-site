<p>Some students find it quite difficult to grasp why the DC output voltage of a common-emitter amplifier <em>decreases</em> as the DC input voltage level increases. Step-by-step DC analysis of the circuit is the only remedy I have found to this conceptual block: getting students to carefully analyze what happens as voltages increase and decrease.</p>
<p>Crossover distortion is always a concern with class B amplifiers, because there is that point where one transistor &quot;hands off&quot; to the other near the zero-crossing point of the waveform. Ideally, the &quot;hand off&quot; is seamless, with one transistor beginning to conduct just as the other one cuts off, but this is difficult to achieve. One way to grasp the nature of the problem is to imagine a class-B amplifier with little or no bias trying to amplify a <em>very</em> small DC input voltage. Unless the input signal is enough to get one of the transistors conducting, there will be no resulting output! This is not good, as an amplifier should at least do <em>something</em> with any input signal, no matter how small.</p>
