<p>If an AC voltage has a frequency of 350 Hz, how long (in time) is its period?</p>
<p>Period = 2.8571 milliseconds</p>
<p>It is important for students to realize the reciprocal relationship between frequency and period. One is <em>cycles per second</em> while the other is <em>seconds per cycle</em>.</p>
