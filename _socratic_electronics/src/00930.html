<p>For all practical purposes, how much voltage exists between the inverting and noninverting input terminals of an op-amp in a functioning negative-feedback circuit?</p>
<p>Zero volts</p>
<p>Ask your students to explain why there will be (practically) no voltage between the input terminals of an operational amplifier when it is used in a negative feedback circuit.</p>
