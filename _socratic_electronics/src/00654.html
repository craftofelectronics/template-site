<p>Radio communication functions on the general principle of high-frequency AC power being <em>modulated</em> by low-frequency data. Two common forms of modulation are <em>Amplitude Modulation</em> (AM) and <em>Frequency Modulation</em> (FM). In both cases, the modulation of a high frequency waveform by a lower-frequency waveform produces something called <em>sidebands</em>.</p>
<p>Describe what &quot;sidebands&quot; are, to the best of your ability.</p>
<p>&quot;Sidebands&quot; are sinusoidal frequencies just above and just below the carrier frequency, produced as a result of the modulation process. On a spectrum analyzer, they show up as peaks to either side of the main (carrier) peak. Their quantity, frequencies, and amplitudes are all a function of the data signals modulating the carrier.</p>
<p>Be sure to ask your students what &quot;AM&quot; and &quot;FM&quot; mean, before they present their answers on sidebands.</p>
<p>The answer makes frequent use of the word <em>carrier</em> without defining it. This is another intentional &quot;omission&quot; designed to make students do their research. If they have taken the time to find information on sidebands, they will surely discover what the word &quot;carrier&quot; means. Ask them to define this word, in addition to their description of sidebands.</p>
