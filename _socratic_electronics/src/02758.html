<p>A <em>logic probe</em> is a very useful tool for working with digital logic circuits. It indicates &quot;high&quot; and &quot;low&quot; logic states by means of LED’s, giving visual indication only if the voltage levels are appropriate for each state.</p>
<p>Here is a schematic diagram for a logic probe built using comparators. Each comparator has a threshold adjustment potentiometer, so that it may be set to indicate its respective logic state only if the signal voltage is well within the range stated by the logic manufacturer:</p>

<p>Explain how this circuit functions.</p>
<p>I’ll let you and your classmates figure out how this circuit functions!</p>
<p>Follow-up question #1: explain how you could use a voltmeter as a logic probe to do troubleshooting in a digital circuit.</p>
<p>Follow-up question #2: write a formula for calculating appropriate current-limiting resistor sizes for the two LEDs in this circuit, given the value of <span class="math"> + <em>V</em></span> and the LED forward voltage and current values.</p>
<p>It is important for students to understand that there is a certain range of voltage between a guaranteed &quot;high&quot; state and a guaranteed &quot;low&quot; state that is indeterminate, and that this logic probe circuit is designed to indicate this range of voltage by turning neither LED on.</p>
<p>If time permits, discuss some of the benefits and drawbacks to using a voltmeter as a logic probe (especially a <em>digital</em> voltmeter where the display update time may be relatively long).</p>
