<p>It is relatively easy to design and build an electronic circuit to make square-wave voltage signals. More difficult to engineer is a circuit that directly generates triangle-wave signals. A common approach in electronic design when triangle waves are needed for an application is to connect a <em>passive integrator</em> circuit to the output of a square-wave oscillator, like this:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01896x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Anyone familiar with RC circuits will realize, however, that a passive integrator will not output a true triangle wave, but rather it will output a waveshape with &quot;rounded&quot; leading and trailing edges:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01896x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>What can be done with the values of <span class="math"><em>R</em></span> and <span class="math"><em>C</em></span> to best approximate a true triangle wave? What variable must be compromised to achieve the most linear edges on the integrator output waveform? Explain why this is so.</p>
<p>Maximum values of <span class="math"><em>R</em></span> and <span class="math"><em>C</em></span> will best approximate a true triangle wave. The consequences of choosing extremely large values for <span class="math"><em>R</em></span> and/or <span class="math"><em>C</em></span> are not difficult to determine â€“ I leave that for you to explain!</p>
<p>This question asks students to recognize conflicting design needs, and to balance one need against another. Very practical skills here, as real-life applications almost always demand some form of practical compromise in the design stage.</p>
<p>If students cannot figure out what must be sacrificed to achieve waveshape linearity, tell them to build such a circuit and see for themselves!</p>
