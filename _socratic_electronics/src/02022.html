<p>Note: when testing the frequency response of the tone control circuit, you may need to replace the headphones with a non-inductive resistor of equivalent impedance, and measure <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>o</em><em>u</em><em>t</em></sub></span> across it.</p>
<p>Use circuit simulation software to verify your predicted and measured parameter values.</p>
<p>A good source of audio signal is the headphone output jack of almost any radio, media player, or other portable audio device. Students like being able to do a lab exercise that directly relates to technology they’re already familiar with.</p>
<p>The higher-impedance the headphones are, the better this circuit works, since the combination of potentiometers and mixing resistors tends to result in a relatively high output impedance. I have used cheap headphones (32 ohm) with some success, given the following component values:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math"><em>C</em><sub>1</sub></span> = 0.1 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>F</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math"><em>L</em><sub>1</sub></span> = 200 mH (actually two 100 mH inductors in series)</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> = <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span> = 1 k<span class="math">Ω </span></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>p</em><em>o</em><em>t</em>1</sub></span> = <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>p</em><em>o</em><em>t</em>2</sub></span> = 10 k<span class="math">Ω </span></p>
<p>Some students with limited hearing range have difficulty detecting the changes in tone using 10 k<span class="math">Ω </span> potentiometers. You may wish to use 100 k<span class="math">Ω </span> potentiometers instead for added attenuation. Operating such a circuit is akin to operating a water faucet with &quot;hot&quot; and &quot;cold&quot; water valves: the two settings together determine temperature <em>and</em> flow (tone and volume, respectively, for the metaphorically challenged).</p>
<p>An extension of this exercise is to incorporate troubleshooting questions. Whether using this exercise as a performance assessment or simply as a concept-building lab, you might want to follow up your students’ results by asking them to predict the consequences of certain circuit faults.</p>
<p>If you plan to use this exercise as a troubleshooting assessment, I recommend <em>against</em> inducing the following component failures, as they are difficult to detect when the signal source is music rather than a constant tone of known frequency and amplitude:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Shorted capacitor (<span class="math"><em>C</em><sub>1</sub></span>)</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Shorted inductor (<span class="math"><em>L</em><sub>1</sub></span>)</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Shorted fixed-value resistors (<span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> or <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span>)</p>
