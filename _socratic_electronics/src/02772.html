<p>Identify each of these logic gates by name, and complete their respective truth tables:</p>

<p>In order to familiarize students with the standard logic gate types, I like to given them practice with identification and truth tables each day. Students need to be able to recognize these logic gate types at a glance, or else they will have difficulty analyzing circuits that use them.</p>
