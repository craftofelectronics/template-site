<p>An important parameter when specifying traces on printed circuit boards is the <em>ounce</em> rating of the copper used. &quot;1 ounce&quot; copper is very common for general-purpose work. Explain how this &quot;ounce&quot; rating is defined, and why you might want to use &quot;2 ounce&quot; or &quot;4 ounce&quot; copper instead of &quot;1 ounce&quot; for certain traces on your board designs.</p>
<p>The &quot;ounce&quot; rating of PCB copper is defined as weight of that thickness of copper trace, for one square foot of trace area. Heavier ounce ratings are used for high-current and/or high-reliability traces.</p>
<p>Ask your students to compare and contrast the &quot;ounce&quot; rating of PCB traces to wire &quot;gauge.&quot;</p>
