<p>If we were to analyze the magnetic flux lines of a current-carrying conductor, oriented perpendicularly to a magnetic field between two bar magnets, the interaction would look something like this:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00396x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>This interaction of magnetic flux lines (the bar magnets’ straight lines versus the wire’s circles) will produce a mechanical force on the wire (called the <em>Lorentz</em> force). Which direction will this force act? Also, determine the direction of current through the conductor (seen from an end-view in the above illustration) necessary to produce the circular magnetic flux shown.</p>

<p>This question serves as a good application of the right-hand rule (or left-hand rule, if you follow electron flow notation).</p>
