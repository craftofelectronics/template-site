<p>The equation for voltage gain (<span class="math"><em>A</em><sub><em>V</em></sub></span>) in a typical inverting, single-ended opamp circuit is as follows:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$A_V = {R_{1} \over R_{2}}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Where,</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> is the feedback resistor (connecting the output to the inverting input)</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span> is the other resistor (connecting the inverting input to voltage signal input terminal)</p>
<p>Suppose we wished to change the voltage gain in the following circuit from 3.5 to 4.9, but only had the freedom to alter the resistance of <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span>:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02708x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Algebraically manipulate the gain equation to solve for <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span>, then determine the necessary value of <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span> in this circuit to give it a voltage gain of 4.9.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$R_2 = {R_1 \over A_V}$</span><br /></p>
<p>For the circuit shown, <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span> would have to be set equal to 1.571 k<span class="math">Ω </span>.</p>
<p>Nothing more than a little algebra to obtain the answers for this question!</p>
