<p>A student is pondering the behavior of a simple series RC circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02176x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>It is clear by now that the 4 k<span class="math">Ω </span> capacitive reactance does not directly add to the 3 k<span class="math">Ω </span> resistance to make 7 k<span class="math">Ω </span> total. Instead, the addition of impedances is <em>vectorial</em>:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\sqrt{{X_C}^2 + R^2}= Z_{total}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">${\bf Z_C} + {\bf Z_R} = {\bf Z_{total}}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$(4 \hbox{k}\Omega \&gt; \angle -90^o) + (3 \hbox{k}\Omega \&gt; \angle \&gt; 0^o) = (5 \hbox{k}\Omega \&gt; \angle -53.13^o)$</span><br /></p>
<p>It is also clear to this student that the component voltage drops form a vectorial sum as well, so that 4 volts dropped across the capacitor in series with 3 volts dropped across the resistor really does add up to 5 volts total source voltage:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">${\bf V_C} + {\bf V_R} = {\bf V_{total}}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$(4 \hbox{V} \&gt; \angle -90^o) + (3 \hbox{V} \&gt; \angle \&gt; 0^o) = (5 \hbox{V} \&gt; \angle -53.13^o)$</span><br /></p>
<p>What surprises the student, though, is power. In calculating power for each component, the student arrives at 4 mW for the capacitor (4 volts times 1 milliamp) and 3 mW for the resistor (3 volts times 1 milliamp), but only 5 mW for the total circuit power (5 volts times 1 milliamp). In DC circuits, component power dissipations <em>always</em> added, no matter how strangely their voltages and currents might be related. The student honestly expected the total power to be 7 mW, but that doesn’t make sense with 5 volts total voltage and 1 mA total current.</p>
<p>Then it occurs to the student that power might add vectorially just like impedances and voltage drops. In fact, this seems to be the only way the numbers make any sense:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02176x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>However, after plotting this triangle the student is once again beset with doubt. According to the Law of Energy Conservation, total power in must equal total power out. If the source is inputting 5 mW of power total to this circuit, there should be no possible way that the resistor is dissipating 3 mW <em>and</em> the capacitor is dissipating 4 mW. That would constitute more energy leaving the circuit than what is entering!</p>
<p>What is wrong with this student’s power triangle diagram? How may we make sense of the figures obtained by multiplying voltage by current for each component, and for the total circuit?</p>
<p>Only the resistor actually dissipates power. The capacitor only absorbs and releases power, so its &quot;4 mW&quot; figure does not actually represent power in the same sense as the resistor. To make this sensible, we must think of all the non-resistive &quot;powers&quot; as something other than actual work being done over time:</p>

<p>Follow-up question: when making the leap from DC circuit analysis to AC circuit analysis, we needed to expand on our understanding of &quot;opposition&quot; from just resistance (<span class="math"><em>R</em></span>) to include reactance (<span class="math"><em>X</em></span>) and (ultimately) impedance (<span class="math"><em>Z</em></span>). Comment on how this expansion of terms and quantities is similar when dealing with &quot;power&quot; in an AC circuit.</p>
<p>The point of this question is to ease the pain of learning about power factor by relating it to a parallel concept: opposition to electric current (<span class="math"><em>R</em></span> expanding into <span class="math"><em>X</em></span> and <span class="math"><em>Z</em></span>). This makes the follow-up question very significant.</p>
