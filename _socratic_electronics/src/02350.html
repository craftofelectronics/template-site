<p>Identify two different ways that an SCR or a TRIAC may be forced into its &quot;off&quot; (non-conducting) state:</p>
<p><span class="math">1. </span></p>
<p><span class="math">2. </span></p>
<p><span class="math">1. </span> Low current dropout (interrupting current with some other switching device)</p>
<p><span class="math">2. </span> &quot;Reverse-firing&quot; the gate with a voltage pulse of the &quot;wrong&quot; polarity</p>
<p>Although low-current dropout is the most common method of terminating conduction through SCRs and TRIACs, it is important that students realize it is not the only way. The other method, though, is often very difficult to achieve with ordinary SCRs or TRIACs.</p>
