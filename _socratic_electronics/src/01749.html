<p>Calculate the proper value of resistance <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span> needs to be in order to draw 40% of the total current in this circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01749x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span> = 1.5 k<span class="math">Ω </span></p>
<p>Follow-up question: explain how you could arrive at a rough estimate of <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span>’s necessary value without doing any algebra. In other words, show how you could at least set limits on <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span>’s value (i.e. &quot;We know it has to be less than . . .&quot; or &quot;We know it has to be greater than . . .&quot;).</p>
<p>This is an interesting problem to solve algebraically from the current divider formula. I recommend using the product-over-sum formula for parallel resistance if you plan on doing this algebraically. The estimation question (in the follow-up) is also very good to discuss with your students. It is possible to at least &quot;bracket&quot; the value of <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span> between two different resistance values without doing any math more complex than simple (fractional) arithmetic.</p>
<p>Of course, a less refined approach to solving this problem would be to assume a certain battery voltage and work with numerical figures – but what fun is that?</p>
