<p>Match the following field-effect transistor illustrations to their respective schematic symbols:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00986x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00986x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Be sure to ask your students to identify which symbol is the &quot;P-channel&quot; and which is the &quot;N-channel&quot; transistor!</p>
<p>It might help to review diode symbols, if some students experience difficulty in matching the designations (P-channel versus N-channel) with the schematic symbols.</p>
