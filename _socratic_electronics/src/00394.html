<p>A DC motor may be thought of as a series of electromagnets, radially spaced around a common shaft:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00394x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>This particular motor is of the &quot;permanent magnet&quot; type, with wire windings only on the armature.</p>
<p>Write the necessary magnetic polarities (&quot;N&quot; for north and &quot;S&quot; for south) on the armature’s electromagnet pole tips, in order to sustain a <em>clockwise</em> rotation.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00394x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Follow-up question: suppose this motor did not rotate like it was supposed to when energized. Identify some possible (specific) failures that could result in the motor not moving upon energization.</p>
<p>The illustration shown in both the question and the answer provides a good medium for discussing commutation. Discuss with your students how, in order for the motor’s rotation to be continuous, the electromagnets radially spaced around the shaft must energize and de-energize at the right times to always be &quot;pulling&quot; and &quot;pushing&quot; in the correct direction.</p>
<p>Be sure to spend time on the follow-up question with your students, considering non-electrical as well as electrical fault possibilities.</p>
