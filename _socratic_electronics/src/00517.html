<p>A battery has an advertised capacity of 600 amp-hours, taken from tests performed over an 8-hour period (where capacity in amp-hours = <span class="math"><em>I</em><em>t</em></span>). According to Peukert’s formula, what rate of current discharge will result in the battery fully discharging in 3 hours (assume an <span class="math"><em>n</em></span> value of 1.35)?</p>
<p>155 amps</p>
<p>Ask your students to calculate the amount of current predicted by the &quot;simple&quot; amp-hour equation for a discharge time of 3 hours. In your students’ estimation, which is a more realistic prediction, Peukert’s formula or the amp-hour (<span class="math"><em>I</em><em>t</em></span>) formula?</p>
