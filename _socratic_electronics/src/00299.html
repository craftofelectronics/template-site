<p>What is the difference between the following potentiometers, as indicated by their respective symbols?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00299x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The symbol on the left belongs to a standard, knob-adjustable potentiometer. The symbol on the right belongs to a &quot;trimpot,&quot; which is a potentiometer adjustable only by a screwdriver, intended for non-routine adjustments.</p>
<p>Ahhh, the joy of symbols! Do not be surprised if students are able to dredge up all kinds of electronic component symbols from symbol libraries youâ€™ve never seen before.</p>
