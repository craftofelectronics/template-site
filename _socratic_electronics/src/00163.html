<p>In calculating the thickness of insulators for high-voltage AC power lines, which type of measurement is the best to use for voltage: peak, average, or RMS? Explain why.</p>
<p>Peak voltage is the most appropriate type of measurement for calculating insulator thickness. The reason why has to do with the time required for an insulator to &quot;flash over.&quot;</p>
<p>A closely related subject is <em>insulator breakdown</em>, or <em>dielectric strength</em>. What actually happens when the dielectric strength rating of an insulator is exceeded?</p>
