<p>The output of the following gate circuit is always high, no matter what states the input switches are in. Assume that CMOS logic gates are being used here:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02894x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Identify which of these possibilities could account for the output always being high:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Output of <span class="math"><em>U</em><sub>1</sub></span> stuck in a high state</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Output of <span class="math"><em>U</em><sub>2</sub></span> stuck in a high state</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> failed open</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span> failed shorted</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>3</sub></span> failed shorted</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Switch A failed open</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Switch B failed shorted</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Switch C failed shorted</p>
<p>Only these three possibilities could account for the output always being high:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> failed open</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>3</sub></span> failed shorted</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Switch B failed shorted</p>
<p>Questions like this help students hone their troubleshooting skills by forcing them to think through the consequences of each possibility. This is an essential step in troubleshooting, and it requires a firm understanding of circuit function.</p>
