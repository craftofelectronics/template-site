<p>Calculate the total impedance (<span class="math"><em>Z</em></span>) of a series inductor-resistor circuit where the inductance is 200 mH, the resistance is 7.1 k<span class="math">Ω </span>, and the AC frequency is 15 kHz. Express your answer in both polar and rectangular forms.</p>
<p><span class="math">${\bf Z}$</span> (polar form) =</p>
<p><span class="math">${\bf Z}$</span> (rectangular form) =</p>
<p><span class="math">${\bf Z}$</span> (polar form) = 20.14 k<span class="math">Ω </span> <span class="math">∠</span> 69.36<span class="math">$^{o}$</span></p>
<p><span class="math">${\bf Z}$</span> (rectangular form) = 7100 + j18849.6 <span class="math">Ω </span></p>
