<p>When testing this circuit for the first time, the student connects a 1 k<span class="math">Ω </span> resistor to the two test leads and gets this result from the oscilloscope display:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01928x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The student was actually expecting something that looked like this:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01928x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Upon inspection, nothing appears to be wrong with the wiring of the curve tracer circuit. Explain what the problem is so the student is able to achieve the expected results.</p>
<p>One of the oscilloscope’s two input channels must be <em>inverted</em> for the curve tracer to work as expected. Most oscilloscopes come equipped with an &quot;invert&quot; control on the second input channel that is used for this purpose.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: is the curve tracer circuit configured for an AC test or a DC test, based on the appearance of the oscilloscope trace?</p>
<p>This circuit provides an excellent opportunity for students to discuss and review the common grounds of oscilloscope inputs, and why one of the oscilloscope’s inputs must be wired &quot;backward&quot; in order to yield the expected trace from lower-left to upper-right.</p>
