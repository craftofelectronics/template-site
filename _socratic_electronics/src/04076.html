<p>In metallic conductors, the dominant carriers of electric charge are <em>free electrons</em>, which of course are negatively charged. Are there any examples of electric conduction where electric charge is carried by positively-charged particles?</p>
<p>One example is conduction in a fluid electrolyte solution, where you often have both positively-charged ions and negatively-charged ions (moving in opposite directions!) constituting the motion of electric charge.</p>
<p>Other examples exist, so do not accept the given answer as the only answer!</p>
<p>Note: some students may suggest holes in semiconductors as an example of positive charge-carriers. This is technically not true, though. A &quot;hole&quot; does not exist as a real particle of matter. It is an abstraction, used by solid-state physicists and engineers to differentiate conduction-band electron motion (&quot;electrons&quot;) from valence-band electron motion (&quot;holes&quot;).</p>
