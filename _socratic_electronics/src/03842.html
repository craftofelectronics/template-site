<p>Identify which transistor terminal functions as the <em>source</em> and which transistor terminal functions as the <em>drain</em> in both of these JFET circuits:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03842x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Most importantly, explain <em>why</em> we define the terminals as such, given the fact that is usually no physical difference between these two terminals of a JFET.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03842x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The &quot;why&quot; answer is related to the type of majority charge carrier within the channel of each JFET.</p>
<p>The distinction between source and drain for any kind of FET (JFET or MOSFET) is important because the controlling voltage (<span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>G</em><em>S</em></sub></span>) must be applied between gate and <em>source</em>, not between gate and <em>drain</em>.</p>
