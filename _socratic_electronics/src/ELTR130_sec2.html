<p>Few concepts are as fundamentally important in electronics as negative feedback, and so it is essential for the electronics student to learn well. However, it is not an easy concept for many to grasp. The notion that a portion of the output signal may be &quot;fed back&quot; into the input in a degenerative manner to stabilize gain is far from obvious. One of the most powerfully illustrative examples I know of is the use of negative feedback in a voltage regulator circuit to compensate for the base-emitter voltage drop of 0.7 volts (see question file #02286).</p>
<p>This is a misconception that seems to have an amazing resistance to correction. There seem to always be a few students who think that there is a direct path for current from the input terminals of an opamp to its output terminal. It is very important to realize that <em>for most practical purposes, an opamp draws negligible current through its input terminals!</em> What current does go through the output terminal is <em>always</em> supplied by the terminals and from the power supply, never by the input signal(s). To put this into colloquial terms, the input terminals on an opamp tell the output what to do, but they do not give the output its &quot;muscle&quot; (current) to do it.</p>
<p>I think the reason for this misconception is the fact that power terminals are often omitted from opamp symbols for brevity, and after a while of seeing this it is easy to forget they are really still there performing a useful function!</p>
<p>Many students have the unfortunate tendency to memorize rather than think. When approaching all the different types of operational amplifier circuits, this tendency is a recipe for failure. Instead of learning how to effectively apply Kirchhoff’s Laws to the analysis of different opamp circuits, many students simply try to rote-memorize what all the different circuits do. Not only will these students experience difficulty remembering all the variations in circuit behavior, but they will also be helpless in troubleshooting opamp circuits, as a faulted circuit will not behave as it should! There is only one correct approach here, and that is to the application of Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law and Kirchhoff’s Current Law. Difficult? Perhaps, but necessary. Remember: <em>there are no shortcuts to learning!</em></p>
