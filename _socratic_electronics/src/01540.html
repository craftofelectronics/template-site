<p>Determine an equivalent <em>parallel</em> RC network for the series RC network shown on the left:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01540x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Note that I have already provided a value for the capacitor’s reactance (<span class="math"><em>X</em><sub><em>C</em></sub></span>), which of course will be valid only for a particular frequency. Determine what values of resistance (<span class="math"><em>R</em></span>) and reactance (<span class="math"><em>X</em><sub><em>C</em></sub></span>) in the parallel network will yield the exact same total impedance (<span class="math"><em>Z</em><sub><em>T</em></sub></span>) at the same signal frequency.</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>R</em> = </span> 150 <span class="math">Ω </span></p>
<p><span class="math"><em>X</em><sub><em>C</em></sub> = </span> 200 <span class="math">Ω </span></p>
<p>Follow-up question: explain how you could check your conversion calculations, to ensure both networks are truly equivalent to each other.</p>
<p>This problem just happens to work out with whole numbers. Believe it or not, I chose these numbers entirely by accident one day, when setting up an example problem to show a student how to convert between series and parallel equivalent networks!</p>
