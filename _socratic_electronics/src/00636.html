<p>Calculate the total impedance of this series network of impedances, in complex form:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00636x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math">${\bf Z_{total}} =$</span> 1.526 k<span class="math">Ω </span> <span class="math">∠</span> 9.336<span class="math">$^{o}$</span></p>
<p>Follow-up question: overall, does this network behave more like a capacitor, an inductor, or a resistor? Explain your answer.</p>
<p>Students should find series impedance calculations very similar to series (DC) resistance calculations, the only significant difference being the use of complex instead of scalar numbers.</p>
