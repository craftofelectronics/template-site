<hr />
<p>Your project is to design and build a signal generator, using an integrated circuit dedicated to this purpose. I recommend using either the Harris 8038 or the Maxim MAX038CPP. Complete schematic diagrams for signal generator circuits may be found on the respective datasheets for these devices.</p>
<p>The signal generator must be powered by AC from the line, so it needs to have its own regulated AC-DC power supply! Signal frequency and amplitude must be independently adjustable, ideally with &quot;coarse&quot; and &quot;fine&quot; adjustments for frequency. Your circuit must be able to output sine, square, and triangle wave signals, either selectable or simultaneous outputs.</p>
