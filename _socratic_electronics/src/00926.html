<p>An op-amp has +3 volts applied to the inverting input and +3.002 volts applied to the noninverting input. Its open-loop voltage gain is 220,000. Calculate the output voltage as predicted by the following formula:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>o</em><em>u</em><em>t</em></sub> = <em>A</em><sub><em>V</em></sub>(<em>V</em><sub><em>i</em><em>n</em>( + )</sub> − <em>V</em><sub><em>i</em><em>n</em>( − )</sub>)</span><br /></p>
<p>How much differential voltage (input) is necessary to drive the output of the op-amp to a voltage of -4.5 volts?</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>o</em><em>u</em><em>t</em></sub> = </span> 440 volts</p>
<p>Follow-up question: is this voltage figure realistic? Is it possible for an op-amp such as the model 741 to output 440 volts? Why or why not?</p>
<p>The differential input voltage necessary to drive the output of this op-amp to -4.5 volts is -20.455 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>V.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: what does it mean for the input voltage differential to be <em>negative</em> 20.455 microvolts? Provide an example of two input voltages (<span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>i</em><em>n</em>( + )</sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>i</em><em>n</em>( − )</sub></span>) that would generate this much differential voltage.</p>
<p>Obviously, there are limitations to the op-amp formula for calculating output voltage, given input voltages and open-loop voltage gain. Students need to realize the practical limits of an op-amp’s output voltage range, and what sets those limits.</p>
