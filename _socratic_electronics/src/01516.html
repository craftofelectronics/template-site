<p>Your circuit will no doubt use a zener diode to establish the reference voltage. The zener diode circuit itself (including the series &quot;dropping&quot; resistor) is incapable of supplying high current to a load. How, then, does your circuit manage to supply at least <em>2 amps</em> to the load, when using a zener voltage reference?</p>
<p>The zener reference circuit will have to be &quot;followed&quot; by a transistor amplifier of some sort.</p>
<p>Student designs will vary on this point, exactly how they boost the zenerâ€™s low current output up to 2 amps. Indeed, this is the real challenge of the design, to make a good amplifier for the task.</p>
