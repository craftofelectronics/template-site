<p>If a junction field-effect transistor is subjected to several different gate-to-source voltages (<span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>g</em><em>s</em></sub></span>), and the drain-to-source voltage (<span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>d</em><em>s</em></sub></span>) &quot;swept&quot; through the full range for each of these gate voltage values, data for an entire &quot;family&quot; of characteristic curves may be obtained and graphed for the transistor:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00993x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Identify the <em>saturation</em>, <em>active</em>, and <em>breakdown</em> regions on this graph.</p>
<p>What do these characteristic curves indicate about the gate voltageâ€™s control over drain current? How are the two signals related to each other?</p>
<p>The <em>saturation</em>, <em>active</em>, and <em>breakdown</em> regions on this graph are equivalent to the same regions in bipolar junction transistor characteristic curves.</p>
<p>The drain current regulation point is established by the gate voltage while in the &quot;active&quot; region.</p>
<p>Ask your students what the characteristic curves would look like for a <em>perfect</em> transistor: one that was a perfect regulator of drain current over the full range of drain-source voltage.</p>
