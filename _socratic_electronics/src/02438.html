<p>Calculate the approximate amount of AC voltage output by this common-collector amplifier circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02438x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Also, explain why the reactance of each capacitor is a negligible factor in the operation of this amplifier circuit, assuming a signal frequency of 5 kHz.</p>
<p>I’ll let you figure out the output voltage on your own! As for the capacitive reactances, they are just over <em>1 ohm each</em> at this frequency: practically a &quot;direct connection&quot; for the AC signal compared to the resistance values throughout the circuit.</p>
<p>Challenge question: calculate the approximate (average) DC voltage dropped across the 1 k<span class="math">Ω </span> emitter resistor.</p>
<p>Students should know the AC voltage gain of this amplifier configuration to be approximately 1, so the output voltage calculation should be trivial. This question is really a test to see whether or not students are able to apply their knowledge of voltage gain to a specific application.</p>
