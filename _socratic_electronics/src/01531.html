<p>How is the frequency of your transmitterâ€™s oscillator circuit established? What would you have to do to change that frequency?</p>
<p>The answer to this question, of course, will vary according to the design of oscillator used in your transmitter circuit. Note that there is likely more than one way to change the frequency of your circuit, so be prepared to give multiple answers during discussion!</p>
<p>This question helps students research and understand their particular oscillator circuit(s). Be it Hartley, Colpitts, or some crystal-controlled topology, students need to know how and why the oscillation frequency is fixed.</p>
