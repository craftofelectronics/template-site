<p>In many ways Boolean algebra is simpler than regular algebra (e.g., there is no such thing as subtraction or division to worry about), but it is still algebra, and because of this fact many students struggle with it. Working with algebraic expressions means precisely following a specific set of absolute rules. This requires a reliable knowledge of those rules and an ability to think rigorously. These are not easy requirements for most human beings, which is why so many people dislike mathematics. There is but one solution to this problem: practice, practice, and practice again. If you find yourself making algebraic mistakes, don’t give up – that would be exactly the wrong thing to do. Learn from your mistakes, pick yourself back up, and try again. It <em>can</em> be done!</p>
<p>Many Boolean rules such as <span class="math"><em>A</em> + <em>A</em><em>B</em> = <em>A</em></span> are easy enough to learn in their canonical form, but more difficult to apply when seen in a form such as <span class="math">$CF\overline{G} + C \overline{G} = C \overline{G}$</span>. Fundamentally, this is a problem with the algebraic principle of <em>substitution</em>: replacing one variable with a different variable or a whole expression. The key to substitution is the ability to perform visual pattern-matching, which some people have a much easier time with than others. Once again, the only solution to this problem is practice, practice, and more practice. Remember that no one comes out of the womb knowing how to do this stuff! Everyone who has any knowledge of algebra at all once started knowing nothing about it. People <em>can</em> learn and succeed at this material, yourself included. Your personal journey through algebra may be more difficult than it is for others, for any number of reasons, but it is not an impossible journey.</p>
