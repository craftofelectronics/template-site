<p>A student builds a four-bit asynchronous counter circuit using CMOS J-K flip-flops. It seems to work . . . most of the time. Every once in a while, the count suddenly and mysteriously &quot;jumps&quot; out of sequence, to a value that is completely wrong. Even stranger than this is the fact that it seems to happen every time the student waves their hand next to the circuit.</p>
<p>What do you suspect the problem to be?</p>
<p>This is a mistake I see students making all the time. The fact that the circuit is built with CMOS components, and fails whenever an object comes near it, is a strong hint that the problem is related to stray static electric charges. It is an easily corrected problem, caused by the student not taking time to connect <em>all</em> the pins of their flip-flops properly.</p>
<p>I didn’t exactly reveal the source of trouble in the answer, but I gave enough hints that anyone familiar with CMOS should be able to tell what it is! This truly is a problem I’ve seen many times with my students!</p>
