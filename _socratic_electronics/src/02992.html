<p>If your event sensing switch is mechanical in nature, you will likely have to deal with <em>contact bounce</em>. Explain what contact &quot;bounce&quot; is and how you can mitigate the problem.</p>
<p>Contact &quot;bounce&quot; is the physical bouncing and interference of metal switch contacts as they come to a closed state, causing spurious pulses which will be interpreted by the counter as multiple events. Perhaps the simplest way to mitigate the effects of contact bounce is to use a passive low-pass filter (RC integrator) circuit followed by a Schmitt trigger gate. Using a serial-in/serial-out shift register is a more sophisticated approach, but requires more components (including a clock signal generator).</p>
<p>Contact bounce can be a big problem in counter circuits getting their input from mechanical switches. Learning how to detect and eliminate this problem is a very practical exercise for electronics technicians.</p>
