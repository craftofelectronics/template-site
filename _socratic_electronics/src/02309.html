<p>What mode does the oscilloscope have to be set in, in order to use with this curve tracer circuit?</p>
<p>The oscilloscope needs to be set in the &quot;X-Y&quot; mode.</p>
<p>It is important for students to realize that the oscilloscope will not produce the desired display if configured for the normal &quot;time-domain&quot; display. For the circuit to be able to work, the curve tracer must provide the horizontal sweep, hence the dual inputs to the oscilloscope.</p>
