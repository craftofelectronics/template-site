<p>The circuit shown here is a four-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC). Specifically, it is a <em>flash</em> converter, so named because of its high speed:</p>

<p>Explain why we must use a <em>priority</em> encoder to encode the comparator outputs into a four-bit binary code, and not a regular encoder. What problem(s) would we have if we were to use a non-priority encoder in this ADC circuit?</p>
<p>I wonâ€™t directly answer this question, but instead pose a &quot;thought experiment.&quot; Suppose the analog input voltage (<span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>i</em><em>n</em></sub></span>) were slowly increased from 0 volts to the reference voltage (<span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>r</em><em>e</em><em>f</em></sub></span>). What do the outputs of the comparators do, one at a time, as the analog input voltage increases? What input conditions does the encoder see? How would a primitive &quot;diode network&quot; type of encoder (which we know does <em>not</em> encode based on priority) interpret the comparator outputs?</p>
<p>Here, I show students a very practical application of a priority encoder, in which the necessity of priority encoding should be apparent after some analysis of the circuit.</p>
