<p>What would have to be altered in this circuit to increase its overall voltage gain?</p>

<p>The voltage divider would have to altered so as to send a smaller proportion of the output voltage to the inverting input.</p>
<p>Ask your students to explain how they would modify the voltage divider in this circuit to achieve the goal of a smaller voltage division ratio. This should be trivial, but it is always good to review basic principles of electricity even when &quot;deep&quot; into a more advanced topic.</p>
