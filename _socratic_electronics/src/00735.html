<p>If a closed-circuit wire coil is brought closer to the end of a permanent magnet, a repulsive force will develop between the magnet and the coil. This force will cease, however, when the coil stops moving. What is this effect called?</p>

<p>Also, describe what will happen if the wire coil fails open. Does the same effect persist? Why or why not?</p>
<p>The phenomenon is known as <em>Lenz’ Law</em>, and it exists only when there is a continuous path for current (i.e. a complete circuit) in the wire coil.</p>
<p>The phenomenon of Lenz’s Law is usually showcased using a metal solid such as a disk or ring, rather than a wire coil, but the phenomenon is the same.</p>
