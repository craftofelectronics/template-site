<p>Shown here is an ammeter circuit with a special type of selector switch, called a <em>make-before-break</em> selector:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01794x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>This special kind of selector switch is important to have in an ammeter circuit such as the one shown above. If we were to build such a similar ammeter using a normal (<em>break-before-make</em>) selector switch, the meter would be susceptible to damage during normal use:</p>

<p>Explain why the first circuit design is superior to the second, and what form of use would prove damaging to the second design (but not to the first).</p>
<p>The type of use that would damage the second meter but not the first is changing ranges while measuring current.</p>
<p>Another solution to the break-before-make problem is to use a <em>ring shunt</em> circuit rather than have an independent range resistor for each current measurement range.</p>
