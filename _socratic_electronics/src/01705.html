<p>As in all technician tasks, safety must be your first priority. Soldering harbors specific dangers of its own that you need to be aware of. Explain what precautions you need to take with regard to the following aspects of soldering:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Safe handling of soldering iron/gun</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Safe handling of solder and flux</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Personal protective equipment</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> What to do (and not do) after soldering</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Never hold it by the metal end – always by the handle!</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Place iron on a stand when idle, and be careful that no flammable materials contact it.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Never leave the iron on, unattended.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Never hold solder in your mouth, as it contains heavy metals that are not healthy for your body.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Avoid breathing fumes – use a ventilation hood if available.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Do not eat food while soldering.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Wash your hands after soldering.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Safety glasses or goggles – an absolute <em>must!</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> If soldering large wires, use heat-resistant gloves.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Clean up worksite.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Give the soldering iron enough time to cool down before putting it away.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Put soldering equipment away where it belongs, and where others can find it.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Never leave the iron on, unattended.</p>
<p>Much of this is common sense, but some of it is not. Students must realize that even though soldering is a relatively low-temperature process, it is still hot enough to start fires and burn skin. Also, molten droplets of solder can cause major damage to the eyes, so safety glasses/goggles are imperative.</p>
