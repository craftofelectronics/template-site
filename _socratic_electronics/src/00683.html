<p>When a steel manufacturer publishes the magnetic characteristics of their latest alloy, they do so in the form of a &quot;B/H&quot; graph, where flux density (<span class="math"><em>B</em></span>) is plotted as a function of magnetizing force (<span class="math"><em>H</em></span>):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00683x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Rarely will you see a plot of flux (<span class="math">Φ </span>) shown as as a function of MMF (<span class="math">${\cal F}$</span>), even though such a plot would appear very similar to the &quot;B/H curve&quot; for that same material. Why is this? Why would a &quot;B/H&quot; curve be preferable to an engineer rather than a &quot;Flux/MMF&quot; curve?</p>
<p>Hint: if a copper manufacturer were to publish the electrical characteristics of their latest alloy, they would specify its resistivity in terms of specific resistance (<span class="math"><em>ρ</em></span>), rather than plain resistance (<span class="math"><em>R</em></span>), for the exact same reason!</p>
<p>A &quot;B/H curve&quot; is independent of the specimen’s physical dimensions, communicating the magnetic characteristics of the <em>substance</em> itself, rather than the characteristics of any one particular <em>piece</em> of that substance.</p>
<p>This concept may confuse some students, so discussion on it is helpful. Ask your students what &quot;flux density&quot; and &quot;magnetizing force&quot; really mean: they are expressions of flux and MMF <em>per unit dimension</em>. So, if a manufacturer states that their new steel alloy will permit a flux density of 0.6 Tesla for an applied magnetizing force of 100 amp-turns/meter, this figure holds true for <em>any</em> size chunk of that alloy.</p>
<p>To prove this concept via the rhetorical technique of <em>reductio ad absurdum</em>, ask your students what it would be like if copper manufacturers specified the resistivity of their copper alloys in ohms: &quot;Alloy 123XYZ has a resistivity of 17 ohms.&quot; Of what usefulness is this statement? What does it mean to us? How is the statement, &quot;Alloy 123XYZ has a resistivity of 10.5 ohm-cmil per foot,&quot; superior?</p>
