<p>Suppose a magnet is moved toward a coil of wire, which is in turn connected to a variable resistance (potentiometer connected as a rheostat):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03473x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Determine the following:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> The polarity of the induced voltage (+ and -)</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> The direction of current through the resistance (conventional flow notation assumed)</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> The direction of physical force exerted on the <em>coil</em> as a result of Lenz’s Law.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Whether the resistance needs to <em>increase</em> or <em>decrease</em> to maximize this force on the coil; or whether the amount of resistance is <em>irrelevant</em> to force.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03473x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The resistance needs to <em>decrease</em> to maximize the force on the coil.</p>
