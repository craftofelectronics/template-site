<p>In many types of digital systems, a set of square-wave signals are phase-shifted from each other by 90<span class="math">$^{o}$</span>. Such a phase relationship is called <em>quadrature</em>.</p>
<p>Determine the output of a D-type latch for this pair of quadrature signals, applied to the D and E inputs over time:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01360x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Then, determine the output of a D-type latch when the phase relationship is reversed, (D leading E by 90<span class="math">$^{o}$</span>, instead of E leading D by 90<span class="math">$^{o}$</span>):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01360x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01360x03.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01360x04.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Students need to be proficient in analyzing pulse diagrams, especially with latch circuits (and later, with flip-flops), because these types of circuits often find application in pulse-driven systems.</p>
