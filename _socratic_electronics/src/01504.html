<p>You will notice that a very important factor in your motor’s performance is the <em>brush angle</em>: the points of contact that the brushes make with the commutator bars, as compared to the axis of the field magnets. What brush angle results in maximum unloaded motor speed? Why can’t we just have the brushes contact the commutator bars at any arbitrary angle?</p>
<p>There are certain brush angles for which the motor simply will not run at all. This relates back to basic DC motor theory, and the interaction between the armature’s magnetic field and the permanent magnets.</p>
<p>I cannot provide an &quot;optimum&quot; brush angle as an answer here, because that will vary with the specific design of your motor.</p>
<p>Students are often fascinated with the effect that different brush contact angles have on motor performance, often spending hours of time experimenting to find the &quot;sweet spot&quot; for their particular motors.</p>
