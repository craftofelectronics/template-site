<p>Explain how you would use a voltmeter to identify the &quot;hot,&quot; &quot;neutral,&quot; and &quot;ground&quot; conductors on a three-prong power receptacle:</p>

<p>Iâ€™ll give you this hint: no more than two voltage measurements are necessary to identify all three jacks in a properly connected three-prong power receptacle!</p>
<p>Knowing how to check for proper wiring in power receptacles is a very practical skill for homeowners. Sure, there are simple neon-lamp testers available that you can simply plug in to a receptacle to test it, but using a voltmeter requires knowledge.</p>
<p>Incidentally, this test is very easy to perform during class discussion time, as multiple power receptacles should be available in any classroom. Be sure to review certain basic safety rules (use one hand only, etc.) when performing this test!</p>
