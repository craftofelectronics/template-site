<p>Suppose we had a long length of electrical <em>cable</em> (flexible tubing containing multiple wires) that we suspected had some broken wires in it. Design a simple testing circuit that could be used to check each of the cableâ€™s wires individually.</p>

<p>A significant portion of electrical/electronic circuit problems are caused by nothing more complex than broken wire connections, or faults along the length of wires. Testing cables for wire breaks is a very practical exercise.</p>
<p>The same technique may be used to &quot;map&quot; wires from one end of a cable to the other, in the event that the wires are not color-coded or otherwise made identifiable.</p>
