<p>Assume that all five-band resistors listed here use the <em>precision</em> color code as opposed to the military 5-band code where the fifth band indicates resistor reliability.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> (Org, Org, Red, Blk, Blu) Measured resistance = 332.5 <span class="math">Ω </span> <em>Within tolerance</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> (Brn, Blk, Blk, Gld, Red) Measured resistance = 9.7 <span class="math">Ω </span> <strong>Out of tolerance!</strong></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> (Blu, Vio, Brn, Red, Grn) Measured resistance = 67.43 k<span class="math">Ω </span> <em>Within tolerance</em></p>

<p>This question serves as a great review for the mathematical concepts of scientific notation and percentages. They will have to calculate the allowable range of resistance values for each resistor in order to determine whether or not the measured value falls within that range.</p>
