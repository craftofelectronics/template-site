<p>If we were to &quot;model&quot; a neon lamp with a standard passive component (resistor, voltage source, current source, capacitor, or inductor) for the sake of mathematically analyzing a circuit containing a neon lamp, what component would best represent the characteristics of the lamp within its &quot;glow&quot; region?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00432x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>A neon lamp within its &quot;glow&quot; region would be best modeled by a <em>voltage source</em>.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: what component best models a neon lamp within the vertical (dashed-line) regions on the graph?</p>
<p>If your students are perplexed at the method of determining the answer, ask them this question: &quot;For the neon lamp, what variable remains <em>constant</em> despite a wide variation in the other variable?&quot;</p>
