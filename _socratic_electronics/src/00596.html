<p>After a period of use, the tip of a soldering iron (or a soldering gun) becomes dark and &quot;encrusted&quot; with oxidation and flux residue. Describe why this accumulation impedes the soldering process, and how it may be removed.</p>
<p>Any oxidation or foreign material on the soldering tool tip will impede heat flow to the item being soldered. Routine cleaning is easy: just touch the hot tip to a water-soaked sponge or rag.</p>
<p>Discuss with your students why a wet sponge or rag works to clean the end of a heated soldering tool. Also, discuss what to do to the tip of a soldering tool that has been abused by lack of periodic cleaning.</p>
