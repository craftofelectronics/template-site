<p>Capacitors tend to oppose change in voltage, and so they may be considered &quot;temporary voltage sources.&quot; That is, they tend to hold a constant voltage over time, but they cannot do so indefinitely. Any motion of charge (current) will change the voltage of a capacitor.</p>
<p>Likewise, inductors may be considered &quot;temporary current sources&quot; because while they tend to hold current constant over time, they cannot do so indefinitely. Any application of voltage across a (perfect) inductor will alter the amount of current going through it.</p>
<p>Given the above characterizations, determine what resistance levels will result in the <em>fastest</em> discharge of energy for both the capacitive circuit and the inductive circuit. Considering each of the reactive components (<span class="math"><em>C</em></span> and <span class="math"><em>L</em></span>, respectively) as &quot;temporary&quot; power sources whose store of energy will drain over time, determine what value of <span class="math"><em>R</em></span> in each circuit will result in the quickest depletion of energy by making each source &quot;work hardest:&quot;</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03526x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Based on your answer to this question, explain how circuit resistance (<span class="math"><em>R</em></span>) affects the time constants (<span class="math"><em>Ï„</em></span>) of RC and of LR circuits.</p>
<p>I will answer this question with another question: what value of <span class="math"><em>R</em></span> in each of these circuits will result in the greatest power dissipation at the load, large <span class="math"><em>R</em></span> or small <span class="math"><em>R</em></span>?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03526x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Large <span class="math"><em>R</em></span> values slow down RC circuits and speed up LR circuits, while small <span class="math"><em>R</em></span> values speed up RC circuits and slow down LR circuits.</p>
<p>The leap I expect students to make here is to think about the exchange of energy for both capacitors and inductors as they deliver power to a resistive load. Which ever values of <span class="math"><em>R</em></span> make the respective sources work the hardest (dissipate the most power at the load) will be the values that make the reactive components discharge quickest.</p>
