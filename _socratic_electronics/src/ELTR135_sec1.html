<p>AC circuit calculations tend to be difficult, if only because of all the math involved. There is no way around this problem except to strengthen one’s math competence, hence the review questions at the end of this worksheet.</p>
<p>Many students have a predisposition to memorization (as opposed to comprehension of concepts), and so when approaching filter circuits they try to identify the various types by memorizing the positions of reactive components. As I like to tell my students, <em>memory will fail you</em>, and so a better approach is to develop analytical techniques by which you may determine circuit function based on &quot;first principles&quot; of circuits. The approach I recommend begins by identifying component impedance (open or short) for very low and very high frequencies, respectively, then qualitatively analyzing voltage drops under those extreme conditions. If a filter circuit outputs a strong voltage at low frequencies and a weak voltage at high frequencies then it must be a low-pass filter. If it outputs a weak voltage at both low and high frequencies then it must be a band-pass filter, etc.</p>
