<p>The real circuit you build will validate your circuit design.</p>
<p>Use a four-pole, unipolar stepper motor for this assessment, with a power supply capable of sourcing the required current.</p>
<p>An extension of this exercise is to incorporate troubleshooting questions. Whether using this exercise as a performance assessment or simply as a concept-building lab, you might want to follow up your studentsâ€™ results by asking them to predict the consequences of certain circuit faults.</p>
