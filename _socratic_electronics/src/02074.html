<p>Metal Oxide Field-Effect Transistors (MOSFETs) differ in some regards from Junction Field-Effect Transistors (JFETs). Explain in your own words what the difference(s) is/are.</p>
<p>Iâ€™ll let you do your own research here.</p>
<p>Despite their many similarities, MOSFETs and JFETs are not identical. Ask your students to explain <em>why</em> the two types of transistor behave differently, not just recite differences read from a textbook or other reference.</p>
