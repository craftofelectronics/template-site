<p>What is <em>polyphase</em> electric power, and how does it differ from <em>single-phase</em> power?</p>
<p>In polyphase systems, there are multiple voltages phase-shifted apart from each other so as to be intentionally &quot;out of step.&quot;</p>
<p>Although the rationale for polyphase electrical power may not be apparent from either the question or the given answer, your students need to be aware of its existence.</p>
