<p>Challenge question: from the simple-parallel equivalent circuit shown here, can you generate an equivalent circuit that is simple-series? In other words, can you calculate the proper values of <span class="math"><em>R</em></span> and <span class="math"><em>L</em></span>, that when connected in series, will have the same total impedance as this circuit?</p>
<p>Fundamentally, this question asks students to generate an equivalent parallel R-X circuit from a given series R-X circuit. In this particular circuit, there are two series-connected R-X branches, resulting in an equivalent parallel circuit with four branches.</p>
<p>Calculating the circuit’s total impedance as a scalar figure involves simplifying the circuit once more into two components: a resistance and a reactance.</p>
