<p>An electric motor is used to power a large conveyor belt. Before the motor actually starts, a warning siren activates to alert workers of the conveyor’s forthcoming action. The following relay circuit accomplishes both tasks (motor control plus siren alert):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{04028x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>However, this circuit is poorly designed. Although it works just fine under normal conditions, it may not do what it should in the event of an overload heater trip (if the normally-closed &quot;OL&quot; contact opens). Explain what is wrong with this circuit.</p>
<p>I’ll give you a hint: suppose someone pushes <em>and holds</em> the start button long enough that time delay relay TD1 completes its timing cycle?</p>
<p>This circuit provides students an opportunity to analyze the workings of a delayed-start motor control circuit, where some other action (a siren in this case) takes place during the motor’s delay. Have your students present both their analyses and the methods behind the analyses as you work through this question with them.</p>
