<p><em>Flash</em> analog-to-digital converters are easy to understand, but are not practical for many applications. Identify some of the drawbacks of the &quot;flash&quot; circuit design.</p>
<p>Flash converter circuits have too many components! Actually, the answer is a bit more detailed than this, but easy enough to find on your own that Iâ€™ll leave the task of research to you.</p>
<p>It is a shame that flash converter circuits suffer the disadvantage(s) that they do. They are so simple to understand and have such an inherent speed advantage over other circuit designs! Discuss with your students why the weaknesses of the flash design make the other ADC types necessary, and even preferable in most applications.</p>
