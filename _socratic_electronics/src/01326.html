<p>Although it is seldom done, it is possible to express a truth table in verbal form, by describing what conditions must be met in order to generate a &quot;high&quot; output.</p>
<p>Take for example this simple truth table, for an inverter circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01326x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>For this truth table, we could say that the output goes high when <span class="math"><em>A</em></span> is low. A different way of saying this would be to state that &quot;the output is <em>true</em> when <span class="math">$\overline{A}$</span> is <em>true</em>.&quot;</p>
<p>Letâ€™s look at another example, this time of an AND gate:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01326x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>For this truth table, we could say that the output goes high when <span class="math"><em>A</em></span> and <span class="math"><em>B</em></span> are both high. A different way of saying this would be to state that &quot;the output is true when <span class="math"><em>A</em></span> is true and <span class="math"><em>B</em></span> is true.&quot; To use a half-Boolean, half-verbal description:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$A \hbox{ AND } B$</span><br /></p>
<p>Examine this logic gate circuit and corresponding truth table:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01326x03.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Express the functionality of this truth table in words. What Boolean conditions must be satisfied (&quot;true&quot;) in order for the output to assume a high state?</p>
<p>The output of this circuit is high when <span class="math">$\overline{A}$</span> is true and <span class="math">$\overline{B}$</span> is true, or when <span class="math"><em>A</em></span> is true and <span class="math"><em>B</em></span> is true:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$(\overline{A} \hbox{ AND } \overline{B}) \hbox{ OR } (A \hbox{ AND } B)$</span><br /></p>
<p>Expressing truth table conditions &quot;verbally&quot; is a way to introduce students to the concept of deriving Boolean expression from them.</p>
