<p>What kind of filtering action (high-pass, low-pass, band-pass, band-stop) does this resonant circuit provide?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01392x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>This circuit is a <em>band-pass</em> filter.</p>
<p>As usual, ask your students to explain <em>why</em> the answer is correct, not just repeat the answer that is given!</p>
