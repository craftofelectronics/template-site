<p>An electronics technician connects the input of a spectrum analyzer to the secondary winding of an AC power transformer, plugged into a power receptacle. He sets the spectrum analyzer to show 60 Hz as the fundamental frequency, expecting to see the following display:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03695x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Instead, however, the spectrum analyzer shows more than just a single peak at the fundamental:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03695x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Explain what this pattern means, in practical terms. Why is this power systemâ€™s harmonic signature different from what the technician expected to see?</p>
<p>What this pattern means is the power-line voltage waveform is distorted from what should be a perfect sine-wave shape.</p>
<p>Note to your students that this is quite typical for modern power systems, due to the prevalence of switching power supply circuits and other &quot;non-linear&quot; electrical loads. The presence of harmonic frequencies in significant quantity can cause severe problems for power systems, including transformer overheating, motor overheating, overloaded neutral conductors (especially in three-phase, four-wire &quot;Wye&quot; systems), and excessive currents through power-factor correction capacitors.</p>
