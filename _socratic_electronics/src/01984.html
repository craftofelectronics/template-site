<p>How many turns of wire must a coil have in order to induce a voltage of 10.5 volts when exposed to a changing magnetic flux with a rate of 0.0075 Wb/s?</p>
<p>1400 turns</p>
<p>This is nothing but a quantitative application of Faradayâ€™s Law, after algebraic manipulation to solve for <span class="math"><em>N</em></span>.</p>
