<p>Explain the difference between a <em>synchronous</em> counter and an <em>asynchronous</em> counter circuit.</p>
<p>A &quot;synchronous&quot; counter circuit’s flip-flops are clocked simultaneously, while each of the &quot;asynchronous&quot; counter circuit’s flip-flops is clocked by the output of the preceding flip-flop.</p>
<p>Ask your students to discuss what advantages, if any, one of these counter circuit types may have over the other.</p>
