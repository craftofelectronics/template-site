<p>Design a voltage divider circuit that splits the power supply voltage into the following percentages:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00357x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>There are many different sets of resistor values that will achieve this design goal!</p>
<p>Different students will likely arrive at different solutions for this design task. Have your students share their differing solutions, emphasizing that there is often more than one acceptable solution to a problem!</p>
