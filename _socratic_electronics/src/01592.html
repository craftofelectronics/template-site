<p>When inserting a signal coupling capacitor into the bias network for this transistor amplifier, which way should the (polarized) capacitor go? (Hint: the AC signal source outputs pure AC, with a time-averaged DC value of 0 volts).</p>

<p>Explain why the orientation of this capacitor matters, and what might happen if it is connected the wrong way.</p>

<p>It is easy to miss the detail of the power supplyâ€™s polarity being &quot;backward&quot; from what is typically seen (negative instead of positive). Actually, I am surprised to see how many introductory textbooks have the coupling capacitor drawn the wrong way, so expect that some students may become confused by researching their texts for the answer!</p>
