<p>This &quot;flash&quot; ADC circuit has a problem. The output code jumps from 0000 to 1111 with just the slightest amount of input voltage (<span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>i</em><em>n</em></sub></span>). In fact, the only time it outputs 0000 is when the input terminal is slightly negative with reference to ground:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03913x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Identify at least two possible component faults that could cause this problem, and explain your reasoning in how you made the identifications.</p>
<p>One possible fault is that resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>16</sub></span> has failed open, but this is not the only possibility.</p>
<p>Have your students explain their reasoning in class to you, so that you may observe their diagnostic thought processes.</p>
