<p>According to Ohmâ€™s Law, how much current goes through each of the two resistors in this circuit?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01963x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Draw the paths of all currents in this circuit.</p>
<p><span class="math">$I_{R(2.2k)} = 10.91 \hbox{ mA}$</span></p>
<p><span class="math">$I_{R(4.7k)} = 5.11 \hbox{ mA}$</span></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01963x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Follow-up question: how much <em>total</em> current does the battery supply to the circuit, given these individual resistor currents?</p>
<p>A key element to this question is the plotting of currents. Students need to see how individual resistor currents graphically relate to the total source current in a parallel circuit, because this has direct bearing on the calculation of total current, and also to an understanding of total resistance in parallel circuits.</p>
