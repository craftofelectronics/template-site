<p>A technician is troubleshooting a power supply circuit that outputs substantially less DC voltage than it should. The output voltage is supposed to be 15 volts DC, but instead it is actually outputting less than 8 volts DC:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02318x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The technician measures approximately 18 volts AC (RMS) across the secondary winding of the transformer. Based on this voltage measurement and the knowledge that there is reduced DC output voltage, identify two possible faults that could account for the problem and all measured values in this circuit, and also identify two circuit elements that could not possibly be to blame (i.e. two things that you know <em>must</em> be functioning properly, no matter what else may be faulted). The circuit elements you identify as either possibly faulted or properly functioning can be wires, traces, and connections as well as components. Be as specific as you can in your answers, identifying both the circuit element and the type of fault.</p>

<p>Troubleshooting scenarios are always good for stimulating class discussion. Be sure to spend plenty of time in class with your students developing efficient and logical diagnostic procedures, as this will assist them greatly in their careers.</p>
