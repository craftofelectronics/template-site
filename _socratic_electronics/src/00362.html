<p>Suppose a technician attempted to measure the resistance of resistor R5 on this printed circuit board:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00362x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>What is wrong with doing this?</p>
<p>R5 is not the only component whose resistance is being measured!</p>
<p>Follow-up question: what components on this printed circuit board <em>may</em> be measured with the ohmmeter without error?</p>
<p>This is very important for students to understand: the fact that the resistance of an individual component cannot be measured in a circuit, unless it is guaranteed that the ohmmeterâ€™s measuring current passes through that component only.</p>
