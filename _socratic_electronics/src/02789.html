<p>Use circuit simulation software to verify your predicted and actual truth tables.</p>
<p>The purpose of this exercise is for students to research what type of IC this is (from the given part number for <span class="math"><em>U</em><sub>1</sub></span>), its pinout, and then predict and prove its operation using truth tables to document the results. You, as the instructor, may select any 14-pin CMOS or TTL logic IC that you wish. Students are to draw the logic gate symbol within the rectangle of <span class="math"><em>U</em><sub>1</sub></span>, then connect that symbol to the input switches and output LED.</p>
<p>It needs to be understood that the &quot;0&quot; and &quot;1&quot; states are defined by voltage levels with respect to ground, and not by switch actuation. Many students assume an actuated (pushed) switch is a &quot;1&quot; input and a de-actuated (unpushed) switch is a &quot;0&quot; input. Not necessarily so! In this circuit, the switches are connecting inputs to <em>ground</em>. This means a closed (actuated) switch provides a low (0) input state, while an open (unactuated) switch provides a high (1) input state.</p>
