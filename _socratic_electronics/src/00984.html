<p>What will an ammeter (with an input resistance of 0.5 <span class="math">Ω </span>) register when connected in <em>parallel</em> with the diode in this circuit?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00984x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Usually, ammeters are connected in <em>series</em> with the component whose current is to be measured. However, in this case a parallel connection is acceptable. Explain why, and determine the ammeter’s current reading in this circuit.</p>
<p>The ammeter will register a current of 4 mA.</p>
<p>A very important point to ask your students is how they figured out the meter’s indication. What circuit analysis technique did they use, and why?</p>
<p>Emphasize solving this problem without using a calculator to do the math. Are your students able to determine the result by estimation alone? Does the input resistance factor into the calculation significantly?</p>
