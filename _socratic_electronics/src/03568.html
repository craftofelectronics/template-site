<p>Calculate the total impedance (<span class="math"><em>Z</em></span>) of a series inductor-resistor circuit where the inductance is 47 mH, the resistance is 1.9 k<span class="math">Ω </span>, and the AC frequency is 3.5 kHz. Express your answer in both polar and rectangular forms.</p>
<p><span class="math">${\bf Z}$</span> (polar form) =</p>
<p><span class="math">${\bf Z}$</span> (rectangular form) =</p>
<p><span class="math">${\bf Z}$</span> (polar form) = 2.163 k<span class="math">Ω </span> <span class="math">∠</span> 28.55<span class="math">$^{o}$</span></p>
<p><span class="math">${\bf Z}$</span> (rectangular form) = 1900 + j1033.6 <span class="math">Ω </span></p>
