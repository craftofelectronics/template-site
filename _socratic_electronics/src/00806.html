<p>If this wire (between the magnet poles) is moved in an upward direction, what polarity of voltage will the meter indicate?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00806x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Describe the factors influencing the magnitude of the voltage induced by motion, and determine whether this is an example of an electric <em>motor</em> or an electric <em>generator</em>.</p>
<p>The voltmeter will indicate a negative voltage in this <em>generator</em> example.</p>
<p>Ask your students to explain their answers regarding factors that influence voltage magnitude. Where did they obtain their information? Are there any mathematical formulae relating these factors to induced voltage?</p>
