<p>Calculate the overall voltage gain of this amplifier circuit (<span class="math"><em>A</em><sub><em>V</em></sub></span>), both as a ratio and as a figure in units of decibels (dB). Also, write a general equation for calculating the voltage gain of such an amplifier, given the resistor values of <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span>:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02458x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math"><em>A</em><sub><em>V</em></sub> = 1 = 0</span> dB</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$A_V = {R_1 \over R_2} \hbox{\hskip 20pt (expressed as a ratio, not dB)}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Follow-up question #1: sometimes the voltage gain equation for an amplifier of this type is given in the following form:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$A_V = -{R_1 \over R_2}$</span><br /></p>
<p>What is the significance of the negative sign in this equation? Is it really necessary, or does it communicate an important concept?</p>
<p>Follow-up question #2: manipulate the gain equation for this amplifier circuit to solve for the value of resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span>.</p>
<p>Whether inverting amplifier gains are expressed as negative or positive quantities seems to be a matter of taste, from surveying introductory textbooks on the subject. I prefer to stick with absolute (positive) gain values and consider signal inversion separately.</p>
