<p>As the armature coils in a DC motor rotate through the magnetic flux lines produced by the stationary field poles, voltage will be induced in those coils. Describe how this phenomenon relates to Faraday’s Law of electromagnetic induction, specifically in regard to what variables influence the magnitude of the induced voltage:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$e = N{d\phi \over dt}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The self-induced voltage produced by a rotating armature is often called the <em>counter-voltage</em>, or <em>counter-EMF</em>. Why would it be called &quot;counter&quot;? What is implied by this terminology, and what electromagnetic principle is illustrated by the &quot;counter&quot; nature of this induced voltage?</p>
<p>Counter-EMF varies directly with armature speed, with the number of turns in the armature windings, and also with field strength. It is called &quot;counter-&quot; EMF because of Lenz’ Law: the induced effect opposes the cause.</p>
<p>The principle I wish to communicate most with this problem is that every motor, when operating, also acts as a generator (producing counter-EMF). This concept is essential to understanding electric motor behavior, especially torque/speed curves.</p>
