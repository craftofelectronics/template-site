<p>Identify what each type of transistor is (MOSFET, JFET, or BJT; N-channel, P-channel, NPN, or PNP, E-type or D-type), and what must be connected to the controlling terminal of each transistor (base or gate) to turn each one <em>on</em> so that the light bulb energizes:</p>

<p>Follow-up question: for the JFET, which is already &quot;on&quot; with zero voltage applied to the gate, describe what would be necessary to force it into the &quot;off&quot; state.</p>
<p>It is very important for students to understand what conditions are necessary to drive any of these transistor types into their &quot;on&quot; states, as a precursor to understanding their function in linear (analog) circuitry.</p>
