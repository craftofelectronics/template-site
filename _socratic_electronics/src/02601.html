<p>A common problem encountered in the development of transistor amplifier circuits is unwanted oscillation resulting from parasitic capacitance and inductance forming a positive feedback loop from output to input. Often, these parasitic parameters are quite small (nanohenrys and picofarads), resulting in very high oscillation frequencies.</p>
<p>Another parasitic effect in transistor amplifier circuits is <em>Miller-effect</em> capacitance between the transistor terminals. For common-emitter circuits, the base-collector capacitance (<span class="math"><em>C</em><sub><em>B</em><em>C</em></sub></span>) is especially troublesome because it introduces a feedback path for AC signals to travel directly from the output (collector terminal) to the input (base terminal).</p>
<p>Does this parasitic base-to-collector capacitance encourage or discourage high-frequency oscillations in a common-emitter amplifier circuit? Explain your answer.</p>
<p>The presence of <span class="math"><em>C</em><sub><em>B</em><em>C</em></sub></span> in a common-emitter circuit mitigates high-frequency oscillations.</p>
<p>Note that I chose to use a the word &quot;mitigate&quot; instead of give the answer in more plain English. Part of my reasoning here is to veil the given answer from immediate comprehension so that students must <em>think</em> a bit more. Another part of my reasoning is to force studentsâ€™ vocabularies to expand.</p>
