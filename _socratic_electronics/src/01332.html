<p>While the &quot;Useful life&quot; and &quot;Wear-out&quot; phases of the system life-cycle are easy to understand, the initial &quot;Infant mortality&quot; phase is not so intuitive. Explain what factors might lead to premature component failure during this initial phase of a systemâ€™s lifespan.</p>
<p>Gross manufacturing defects, incorrect installation, and design flaws, to name a few.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: is it important to know which phase of the life-cycle a system is in before you begin to troubleshoot a problem in it? Explain your answer.</p>
<p>The follow-up question is especially important to discuss with your students. Knowing what portion of the life-cycle a system is in can make a huge difference in your troubleshooting effectiveness. Ask your students why this is. If possible, enlighten the discussion with examples from your own professional experience.</p>
