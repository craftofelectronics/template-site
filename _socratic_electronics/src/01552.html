<p>Explain all the steps necessary to calculate the amount of current in this inductive AC circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01552x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math"><em>I</em> = 15. 6</span> mA</p>
<p>The current is not difficult to calculate, so obviously the most important aspect of this question is not the math. Rather, it is the <em>procedure</em> of calculation: what to do first, second, third, etc., in obtaining the final answer.</p>
