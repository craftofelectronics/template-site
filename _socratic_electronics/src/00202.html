<p>Capacitors may pose an electric shock hazard, even in unpowered circuits. Explain why.</p>
<p>Capacitors have the ability to store dangerous voltage and charge levels even when external energy sources have been disconnected.</p>
<p>An interesting follow-up question to pose would be: how do we safely discharge a capacitor charged with dangerous levels of voltage?</p>
