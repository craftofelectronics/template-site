<p>When the vertical (&quot;Y&quot;) axis of an oscilloscope is shorted, the result should be a straight line in the middle of the screen:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00531x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Determine the DC polarity of the voltage source, based on this illustration:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00531x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00531x03.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>This question challenges students to figure out both the polarization of the probe (and ground clip), as well as the orientation of the Y axis. It is very important, of course, that the coupling control be set on &quot;DC&quot; in order to successfully measure a DC signal.</p>
