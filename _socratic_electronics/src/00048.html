<p>Electric motors of the <em>permanent magnet</em> design are very simple to reverse: just switch the polarity of the DC power to the motor, and it will spin the other direction:</p>

<p>Complete this schematic diagram, showing how a DPDT switch may be placed in this circuit to reverse the motorâ€™s direction of rotation without the need to disconnect and re-connect wires:</p>

<p>DPDT switches are often used as polarity-reversal devices. No doubt your students will see (or build!) this switch arrangement some time in their careers.</p>
