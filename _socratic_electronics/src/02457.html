<p>Calculate the overall voltage gain of this amplifier circuit (<span class="math"><em>A</em><sub><em>V</em></sub></span>), both as a ratio and as a figure in units of decibels (dB). Also, write a general equation for calculating the voltage gain of such an amplifier, given the resistor values of <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span>:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02457x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math"><em>A</em><sub><em>V</em></sub> = 2 = 6. 02</span> dB</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$A_V = {R_1 \over R_2} + 1 \hbox{\hskip 20pt (expressed as a ratio, not dB)}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Follow-up question: explain how you could modify this particular circuit to have a voltage gain (ratio) of 3 instead of 2.</p>
<p>Nothing special here – just some practice with voltage gain calculations.</p>
