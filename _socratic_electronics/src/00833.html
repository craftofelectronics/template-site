<p>Perhaps the most challenging aspect of interpreting ladder diagrams, for people more familiar with electronic schematic diagrams, is how electromechanical relays are represented. Compare these two equivalent diagrams:</p>
<p>First, the ladder diagram:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00833x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Next, the schematic diagram:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00833x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Based on your observations of these two diagrams, explain how electromechanical relays are represented differently between ladder and schematic diagrams.</p>
<p>One of the most significant differences is that in ladder diagrams, relay coils and relay contacts (the normally-open contact in this diagram shown as a capacitor-like symbol) need not be drawn near each other.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: what do the two labels &quot;L1&quot; and &quot;L2&quot; represent?</p>
<p>Discuss these diagrams with your students, noting any significant advantages and disadvantages of each convention.</p>
<p>In reference to the challenge question, the symbols &quot;L1&quot; and &quot;L2&quot; are very common designations for AC power conductors. Be sure your students have researched this and know what these labels mean!</p>
