<p>Calculate one possible set of resistor values that would produce the following percentage splits in current:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00366x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>There are many different sets of resistor values that will achieve this design goal! Iâ€™ll let you try to determine one of your own.</p>
<p>Different students will likely arrive at different solutions for this design task. Have your students share their differing solutions, emphasizing that there is often more than one acceptable solution to a problem!</p>
