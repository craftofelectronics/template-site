<p>RC phase-shift oscillator circuits may be constructed with different numbers of RC sections. Shown here are schematic diagrams for three- and four-section RC oscillators:</p>

<p>What difference will the number of sections in the oscillator circuit make? Be as specific as you can in your answer.</p>
<p>The amount of phase shift per RC section will be different in each circuit, as well as the operating frequency (given the same <span class="math"><em>R</em></span> and <span class="math"><em>C</em></span> component values).</p>
<p>In either case, the point of the RC stages is to phase-shift the feedback signal by 180<span class="math">$^{o}$</span>. It is an over-simplification, though, to say that each stage in the three-section circuit shifts the signal by 60<span class="math">$^{}$</span>, and/or that each stage in the four-section circuit shifts the signal by 45<span class="math">$^{o}$</span>. The amount of phase-shift in each section will not be equal (with equal <span class="math"><em>R</em></span> and <span class="math"><em>C</em></span> values) due to the loading of each section by the previous section(s).</p>
