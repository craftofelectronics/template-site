<p>The following circuit is a three-channel audio <em>mixer</em> circuit, used to blend and amplify three different audio signals (coming from microphones or other signal sources):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00825x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Suppose we measured a 9 kHz sinusoidal voltage of 0.5 volts (peak) at point &quot;A&quot; in the diagram, using an oscilloscope. Determine the voltage at point &quot;B&quot; in the circuit, after this AC signal voltage &quot;passes through&quot; the voltage divider biasing network.</p>
<p>The voltage at point &quot;B&quot; will be a mix of AC and DC, so be sure to express both quantities! Ignore any &quot;loading&quot; effects of the transistor’s base current on the voltage divider.</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>B</em></sub> = </span> 1.318 VDC + 0.5 VAC (peak)</p>
<p>Ask your students what purpose the 47 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>F capacitor serves. Since its presence does not noticeably attenuate the AC signal at point &quot;A&quot; (the whole 0.5 volts AC getting to point B), why not just replace it with a straight piece of wire?</p>
