<p>Suppose you needed a two-input AND gate, but happened to have an unused 3-input AND gate in one of the integrated circuits (&quot;chips&quot;) already in the system you were building. Of course, you could just add another IC containing 2-input AND gates, but it seems a shame to waste the 3-input gate already there.</p>
<p>Explain what you would need to do with the third input terminal on this gate in order to use it as a 2-input AND gate:</p>

<p>Now, explain what to do with each of the following gates’ third inputs, in order to use each of them as 2-input gates:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02948x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>In each case, describe why your solution works.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02948x03.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>A helpful way for students to think about this question is to consider gates in terms of what input state <em>forces</em> the output to go to a particular state. For example, AND gate outputs are forced low by any low input, therefore the unused input had better not be tied to ground – the only remaining option is to tie it high.</p>
