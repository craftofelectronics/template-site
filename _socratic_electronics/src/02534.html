<p>Calculate the overall voltage gain of this cascaded amplifier circuit, where the output of one voltage amplifier feeds into the input of another:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02534x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Also, convert the voltage gains of each amplifier into units of decibels, then convert the overall voltage gain ratio into units of decibels as well.</p>
<p>What do you notice about the overall gain of this circuit in relation to the individual amplifier gains, compared as ratios versus compared as decibel figures?</p>
<p>Cascaded voltage gains expressed as ratios:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math"><em>A</em><sub><em>V</em></sub> = 3 × 2 = 6</span><br /></p>
<p>Cascaded voltage gains expressed a decibel figures:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$A_{V} = 9.54 \hbox{ dB} + 6.02 \hbox{ dB} = 15.56 \hbox{ dB}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Besides providing practice with ratio-to-decibel conversions, the purpose of this question is for students to realize that gains multiply as ratios but add as decibels.</p>
