<p>You are hired to work on a design team, building an electric car. While the electrical engineers work out the details of the motor control circuitry, you are asked to size the battery pack for this car. Assuming a nominal battery pack voltage of 375 volts and an average motor power output of 15 horsepower while driving at 65 miles per hour, calculate the necessary amp-hour capacity to travel 150 miles without recharging. Use 746 watts per horsepower for your power conversion factor, and size the battery pack according to the simple amp-hour formula where capacity equals amps times hours (<span class="math"><em>K</em> = <em>I</em><em>t</em></span>).</p>
<p>Battery capacity (amp-hours) =</p>
<p>Minimum capacity = 68.87 amp-hours.</p>
