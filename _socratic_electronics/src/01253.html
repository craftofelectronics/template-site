<p>A student builds the following digital circuit on a solderless breadboard (a &quot;proto-board&quot;):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01253x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The DIP circuit is a hex inverter (it contains <em>six</em> &quot;inverter&quot; or &quot;NOT&quot; logic gates), but only one of these gates is being used in this circuit. The student’s intent was to build a logic circuit that energized the LED when the pushbutton switch was unactuated, and de-energized the LED when the switch was pressed: so that the LED indicates the reverse state of the switch itself. The student builds this circuit, and it is found to function perfectly well.</p>
<p>Explain the purpose of the resistor on the input of the inverter. What is it there for? What might happen if it were to be removed from the circuit?</p>
<p>Also, explain why the inputs of all the unused inverter gates in this IC have been either connected to ground or to <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>D</em><em>D</em></sub></span>. Is this necessary for the circuit to work properly, or is it just a precautionary measure?</p>
<p>The resistor on the input side of the gate functions as a <em>pulldown</em>, to provide a solid &quot;low&quot; state to the gate’s input when the switch contacts open.</p>
<p>Shorting all unused gate inputs to either ground or <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>D</em><em>D</em></sub></span> is merely a precautionary measure. It prevents unnecessary power draw from the supply, and possible IC overheating.</p>
<p>Discuss the problem of &quot;floating&quot; or &quot;high-Z&quot; states with your students, especially in the context of CMOS. What is it about the nature of a CMOS circuit that makes floating inputs especially troublesome? Ask your students to contrast this against floating TTL inputs.</p>
