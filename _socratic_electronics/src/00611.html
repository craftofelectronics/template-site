<p>The following schematic shows the workings of a simple AM radio receiver, with transistor amplifier:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00611x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The &quot;tank circuit&quot; formed of a parallel-connected inductor and capacitor network performs a very important filtering function in this circuit. Describe what this filtering function is.</p>
<p>The &quot;tank circuit&quot; filters out all the unwanted radio frequencies, so that the listener hears only one radio station broadcast at a time.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: how might a variable capacitor be constructed, to suit the needs of a circuit such as this? Note that the capacitance range for a tuning capacitor such as this is typically in the pico-Farad range.</p>
<p>Challenge your students to describe how to change stations on this radio receiver. For example, if we are listening to a station broadcasting at 1000 kHz and we want to change to a station broadcasting at 1150 kHz, what do we have to do to the circuit?</p>
<p>Be sure to discuss with them the construction of an adjustable capacitor (air dielectric).</p>
