<p>Phasors may be symbolically described in two different ways: <em>polar notation</em> and <em>rectangular notation</em>. Explain what each of these notations means, and why either one may adequately describe a phasor.</p>
<p>Polar notation describes a phasor in terms of magnitude (length) and angle:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02101x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Rectangular notation describes a phasor in terms of horizontal and vertical displacement:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02101x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Follow-up question: why do we need the letter <span class="math"><em>j</em></span> in rectangular notation? What purpose does it serve, and what does it mean?</p>
<p>When discussing the meaning of <span class="math"><em>j</em></span>, it might be good to explain what <em>imaginary numbers</em> are. Whether or not you choose to do this depends on the mathematical aptitude and background of your students.</p>
