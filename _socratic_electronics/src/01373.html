<p>Count from zero to fifteen, in binary, keeping the bits lined up in vertical columns like this:</p>
<p>0000</p>
<p>0001</p>
<p>0010</p>
<p>. . .</p>
<p>Now, reading from top to bottom, notice the alternating patterns of 0’s and 1’s in each place (i.e. one’s place, two’s place, four’s place, eight’s place) of the four-bit binary numbers. Note how the least significant bit alternates more rapidly than the most significant bit. Draw a timing diagram showing the respective bits as waveforms, alternating between &quot;low&quot; and &quot;high&quot; states, and comment on the <em>frequency</em> of each of the bits.</p>

<p>The purpose of this question is to get students to relate the well-known binary counting sequence to electrical events: in this case, square-wave signals of different frequency.</p>
