<p>Interpret this AC motor control circuit diagram, explaining the meaning of each symbol:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00834x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Also, explain the operation of this motor control circuit. What happens when someone actuates the &quot;Run&quot; switch? What happens when they let go of the &quot;Run&quot; switch?</p>
<p>The &quot;Run&quot; switch is a normally-open pushbutton. Relay coil &quot;M1&quot; is energized by this switch, and actuates three normally-open contacts (also labeled &quot;M1&quot;) to send three-phase power to the motor. Note that the details of the power supply are not shown in these diagrams. This is a common omission, done for the sake of simplicity.</p>
<p>Discuss with your students the sources of electrical power for both circuits here: the relay control circuit and the motor itself. Challenge your students to explore this concept by asking them the following questions:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Are the two sources necessarily the same?</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> How does the convention of linking relay coils with contacts by name (rather than by dashed lines and proximity) in ladder diagrams benefit multiple-source circuits such as this one?</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Do these circuits even have to be drawn on the same page?</p>
