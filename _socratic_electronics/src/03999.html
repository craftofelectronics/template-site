<p>A type of resistor network known as an <em>R-2R ladder</em> is often used in digital-to-analog conversion circuits:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03999x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>When all switches in the R-2R ladder are in the &quot;ground&quot; position, the network has a very interesting property regardless of its size. Analyze the Thévenin equivalent resistance (as seen from the output terminal) of the following R-2R ladder networks, then comment on the results you obtain:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03999x06.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03999x05.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03999x04.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03999x03.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03999x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Did you honestly think I’d do all the work for you and just give you the answer?</p>
<p>The answer is not difficult to obtain if you use each Thévenin equivalent resistance to model the left-hand portion of each successive R-2R ladder network as they become more complex! Those students who do not take this problem-solving step are doomed to perform a <em>lot</em> of series-parallel calculations!</p>
