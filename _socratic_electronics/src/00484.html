<p>A <em>strain gauge</em> is a type of sensing device widely used in the aerospace industry, for testing of vehicles and mechanical components. Explain what a strain gauge does, and how it functions.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00484x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>A strain gauge converts micro-mechanical motions (&quot;strain&quot;) into electrical resistance changes. Typically, strain gauges are used to measure the stretching, compressing, and twisting of metal components under stress.</p>
<p>Ask your students to relate their answers to the illustration shown in the question. How does that strange-looking device actually measure strain? How does its resistance change, and why?</p>
