<p>NAME: <strong>Project Grading Criteria</strong> PROJECT:</p>
<p>You will receive the highest score for which <em>all</em> criteria are met.</p>
<p><em>(Must meet or exceed all criteria listed)</em></p>
<p>A. Impeccable craftsmanship, comparable to that of a professional assembly</p>
<p>B. No spelling or grammatical errors anywhere in <em>any</em> document, upon first submission to instructor</p>
<p><em>(Must meet or exceed these criteria in addition to all criteria for 90% and below)</em></p>
<p>A. Technical explanation sufficiently detailed to teach from, inclusive of every component (supersedes 75.B)</p>
<p>B. Itemized parts list complete with part numbers, manufacturers, and (equivalent) prices for <em>all</em> components, including recycled components and parts kit components (supersedes 90.A)</p>
<p><em>(Must meet or exceed these criteria in addition to all criteria for 85% and below)</em></p>
<p>A. Itemized parts list complete with prices of components purchased for the project, plus total price</p>
<p>B. No spelling or grammatical errors anywhere in <em>any</em> document upon final submission</p>
<p><em>(Must meet or exceed these criteria in addition to all criteria for 80% and below)</em></p>
<p>A. “User’s guide” to project function (in addition to 75.B)</p>
<p>B. Troubleshooting log describing all obstacles overcome during development and construction</p>
<p><em>(Must meet or exceed these criteria in addition to all criteria for 75% and below)</em></p>
<p>A. All controls (switches, knobs, etc.) clearly and neatly labeled</p>
<p>B. All documentation created on computer, not hand-written (including the schematic diagram)</p>
<p><em>(Must meet or exceed these criteria in addition to all criteria for 70% and below)</em></p>
<p>A. Stranded wire used wherever wires are subject to vibration or bending</p>
<p>B. Basic technical explanation of all major circuit sections</p>
<p>C. Deadline met for working prototype of circuit (Date/Time = / )</p>
<p><em>(Must meet or exceed these criteria in addition to all criteria for 65%)</em></p>
<p>A. All wire connections sound (solder joints, wire-wrap, terminal strips, and lugs are all connected properly)</p>
<p>B. No use of glue where a fastener would be more appropriate</p>
<p>C. Deadline met for submission of fully-functional project (Date/Time = / ) – supersedes 75.C if final project submitted by that (earlier) deadline</p>
<p><em>(Must meet or exceed these criteria in addition to all criteria for 60%)</em></p>
<p>A. Project fully functional</p>
<p>B. All components securely fastened so nothing is “loose” inside the enclosure</p>
<p>C. Schematic diagram of circuit</p>
<p><em>(Must meet or exceed these criteria in addition to being safe and legal)</em></p>
<p>A. Project minimally functional, with all components located inside an enclosure (if applicable)</p>
<p>B. Passes final safety inspection (proper case grounding, line power fusing, power cords strain-relieved)</p>
<p><em>(If of the following conditions are true)</em></p>
<p>A. Fails final safety inspection (improper grounding, fusing, and/or power cord strain relieving)</p>
<p>B. Intended project function poses a safety hazard</p>
<p>C. Project function violates any law, ordinance, or school policy</p>
<p>Be sure you meet with your instructor if you have any questions about what is expected for your project!</p>
<p>The purpose of this assessment rubric is to act as a sort of “contract” between you (the instructor) and your student. This way, the expectations are all clearly known in advance, which goes a long way toward disarming problems later when it is time to grade.</p>
