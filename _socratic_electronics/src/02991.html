<p>Research datasheets for the 74LS184 and 74LS185 integrated circuits, and then explain how read-only memory technology is used to perform the BCD/binary conversion functions.</p>
<p>These integrated circuits are really just read-only memory chips programmed with <em>look-up tables</em> for converting BCD to binary (74LS184) and binary to BCD (74LS185).</p>
<p>Discuss with your students why someone would choose to implement these functions in a look-up table instead of using combinational logic or a microprocessor/microcontroller. What advantage(s) might be realized with the look-up table approach?</p>
