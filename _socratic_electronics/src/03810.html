<p>Identify which direction each potentiometer wiper must move in this circuit to provide more volume at the headphone.</p>
<p>Moving each wiper to the <em>left</em> will increase volume.</p>
<p>This question simply asks students to interpret potentiometer action in the context of a negative-feedback opamp circuit. Many students seem to experience confusion on the subject of three-terminal potentiometer operation (when <em>not</em> used as a rheostat), so be sure to spend adequate time discussing this with them.</p>
