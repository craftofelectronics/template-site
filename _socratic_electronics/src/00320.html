<p>I once watched a television advertisement for an electric drill, in which one of the people selling this product claimed it was &quot;double-insulated,&quot; to which the other person replied, &quot;So it doesnâ€™t get hot in your hand, right?&quot;</p>
<p>What do you think of this comment? Is this what &quot;double-insulated&quot; means?</p>
<p>While this advertisement was amusing, it was not very informative. No, the term &quot;double-insulated&quot; does <em>not</em> refer to thermal insulation, but rather electrical insulation.</p>
<p>One fact of interest here is that double-insulated tools usually do not have three-prong power plugs. In other words, they do not need a &quot;ground&quot; wire to ensure operator safety.</p>
