<p>This circuit generates a pulse of DC voltage sufficient to energize the neon lamp, every time the switch is opened:</p>

<p>Describe the principle of operation for this simple circuit, and also how it could be modified to produce <em>continuous high-voltage</em> DC power.</p>
<p>Hint: how does a common AC-DC power supply circuit convert <em>pulses</em> of rectified DC into a relatively &quot;smooth&quot; DC output?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01100x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Follow-up question: how would you recommend we &quot;automate&quot; this circuit so that a person does not have to keep pressing and releasing the switch for it to generate a continuous DC output voltage?</p>
<p>Ask your students to explain their solutions for &quot;automating&quot; the switchâ€™s action. Prepare yourself for some creative answers!</p>
