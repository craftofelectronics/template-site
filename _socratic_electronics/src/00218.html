<p>What physical effects of electricity are manifest in a lightning strike?</p>
<p>Heat, light, sound, magnetism (compass needles deflecting), radio (&quot;static&quot; heard on AM radios), and chemical reactions (fixation of nitrogen, and the production of ozone).</p>
<p>Lightning is a universally recognized phenomenon, and one that inspires no small amount of awe. In other words, it is a perfect discussion topic in a science-oriented class! There is much to be learned about lightning from a variety of sources, and it serves as a vivid illustration of electricityâ€™s varied effects.</p>
<p>Having discussed several effects of electricity manifest in lightning strikes, it is an interesting class exercise to discuss possible <em>applications</em> of these effects. What can we do with such phenomenon? Knowing that electricity has the ability to produce heat, light, sound, magnetism, electromagnetic waves, and chemical reactions, what interesting and useful things may we employ electricity for?</p>
