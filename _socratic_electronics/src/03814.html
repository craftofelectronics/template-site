<p>The basic circuit for an unamplified <em>capacitor microphone</em> looks like this:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03814x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Vibrations in the air cause one metal plate to vibrate next to a stationary metal plate, rapidly changing the capacitance between the two plates. Explain how this simple circuit generates an AC voltage from this rapidly-varying capacitance, employing the mathematical relationship between charge (<span class="math"><em>Q</em></span>), capacitance (<span class="math"><em>C</em></span>) and voltage (<span class="math"><em>V</em></span>).</p>
<p>Given the equation <span class="math"><em>Q</em> = <em>C</em><em>V</em></span>, we can see that changes in capacitance will either result in changes of stored charge for a given voltage (<span class="math"><em>Q</em></span> changes with <span class="math"><em>V</em></span> constant), changes in voltage for a given charge (<span class="math"><em>V</em></span> changes with <span class="math"><em>Q</em></span> constant), or changes in both <span class="math"><em>Q</em></span> and <span class="math"><em>V</em></span>. Remember that changes in electric charge over time (<span class="math">$dQ \over dt$</span>) is the mathematical definition of electric current (<span class="math"><em>I</em></span>).</p>
<p>Follow-up question: capacitor microphones are almost never used without some form of amplification. The voltage signal generated by the circuit shown in the question is simply too weak to use on its own. Explain why the signal is so weak.</p>
