<p>Electromechanical relays are essentially digital devices, as logic gates are. Identify at least two ways in which relays differ from gates. These may be differences in construction or in function.</p>
<p>Some differences between relays and gates:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Relays have moving parts, gates don’t.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Relays are slower than gates.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Relay contacts bounce, gate outputs don’t.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Relays require more power to operate.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Relays generally can handle more output power than gates.</p>
