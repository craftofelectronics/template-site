<p>High-power circuits containing SCRs and TRIACs often contain <em>snubber</em> networks comprised of resistors and capacitors connected close to the thyristor devices to shield them from transient voltage &quot;spikes.&quot; Explain why it is important to guard a thyristor device from seeing a fast-rising voltage, even if that voltage is not large enough to directly cause any damage to the thyristor or other components.</p>
<p>A fast rate of voltage rise over time (<span class="math">${dv \over dt}$</span>) is capable of prematurely triggering the thyristor, which could consequently damage the circuit or just cause imprecise control.</p>
