<p>An important performance parameter for amplifier circuits is <em>bandwidth</em>. Explain what &quot;bandwidth&quot; means, and what factor(s) limit the bandwidth for electronic amplifiers.</p>
<p>Bandwidth is the measure of the signal frequency <em>range</em> that an amplifier can effectively handle while maintaining usable gain:</p>

<p>Rolloff at the high-frequency end is largely due to the Miller effect, while rolloff at the low-frequency end is usually due to coupling capacitors in the circuit.</p>
<p>If the graph given in the answer reminds students of a band-pass filter, then they have been paying attention!</p>
