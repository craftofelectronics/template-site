<p>Something has failed in this circuit, because the light bulb does not light up when the switch is closed:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00249x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>What type(s) of transformer fault(s) would cause a problem like this, and how might you verify using a multimeter?</p>
<p>The most common type of transformer fault causing a problem like this is an <em>open</em> winding. This is very easy to check using a multimeter (Iâ€™ll let you answer this part of the question!).</p>
<p>Of course, faults in this circuit having nothing to do with the transformer could also prevent the light bulb from lighting. If time permits, it would be good to analyze a few failure scenarios with your students, challenging them to locate the source of the trouble as efficiently as possible.</p>
