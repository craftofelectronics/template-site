<p>Trace the complete path of current through the fault (shown as a small resistor bridging the wire and the metal case of the heater) when the heaterâ€™s switch is turned on, including the path of this current through the AC voltage source:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03435x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Also, label the three wires between the power source and the heater: <em>Hot</em>, <em>Neutral</em>, and <em>Ground</em>.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03435x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>I recommend assigning one point per correctly labeled wire, and five points for correct tracing of the ground fault current path.</p>
