<p>What would happen to the impedance transformation ratio if a short-circuit developed between some of the turns in the 300-turn winding of this transformer? Explain your answer.</p>

<p>The impedance ratio would increase.</p>
<p>This is somewhat of a &quot;trick&quot; question, because students are accustomed to equating a &quot;short&quot; with a decrease in impedance. While this is generally true, what weâ€™re talking about here is an impedance <em>ratio</em>, rather than any one impedance in particular.</p>
