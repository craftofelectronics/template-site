<p>How could we possibly determine the phasing of the windings in this step-down transformer (120 VAC, 60 Hz primary) so we would know how to connect them for either boosting or bucking service?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00244x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Connect one of the secondary wires to one of the primary wires. Then, measure voltage with a voltmeter between the other two secondary and primary winding wires (the two that are not electrically common). The voltage reading obtained by this test will indicate the phasing.</p>
<p>Note that the answer given to this question leaves the particular details of how to interpret the voltmeter readings unanswered. Challenge your students to figure this out on their own.</p>
<p>Given that autotransformer connections are so practical, it is important for students to know how to test a transformer to see how its (unmarked) windings are phased.</p>
