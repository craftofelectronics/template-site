<p>How much water <em>must</em> flow out of the pipe with the question-mark symbols next to it?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00350x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Explain how this hydraulic example relates to Kirchhoffâ€™s Current Law (KCL) in an electric circuit.</p>
<p>550 gallons per minute (&quot;GPM&quot;), assuming no leaks in the pipe.</p>
<p>Ask your students to draw an electric circuit schematic showing how the same principle illustrated in the hydraulic system would apply to electric current, with &quot;flow rates&quot; of 700 amps, 150 amps, and 550 amps, respectively.</p>
