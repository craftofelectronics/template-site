<p>Identify the &quot;normal&quot; status of each switch, whether it is <em>normally-open</em> (N.O.) or <em>normally-closed</em> (N.C.):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02365x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Based on the symbols shown, describe what physical condition results in the switch contacts being open, and what condition results in the switch contacts being closed, for each switch.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02365x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Limit switch: <em>untouched</em> = contacts open, <em>mechanical force</em> = contacts closed</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Flow switch: <em>no fluid flow</em> = contacts open, <em>fluid flow</em> = contacts closed</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Level switch: <em>dry (hanging in air)</em> = contacts closed, <em>submerged</em> = contacts open</p>
<p>Discuss with your students the different types of switches shown in this question (not just their normal status, but what physical event actuates each type of switch). There are many, many different types of switches – far more than just the types actuated by a human hand!</p>
