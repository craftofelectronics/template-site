<p>Special integrated circuits called <em>delay elements</em> or <em>delay gates</em> are manufactured to provide nanoseconds’ worth of intentional time delays in digital circuits. Identify a part number for such an IC, research its datasheet, and describe an application where one might be needed.</p>
<p>One part number for you to research is 74LS31. Such delay elements might be used to provide ample set-up and/or hold times for signals entering flip-flop.</p>
<p>Discuss with your students why such devices exist, in light of the existence of 555 timers. Why couldn’t a 555 timer be used for the same purpose as the 74LS31?</p>
