<p>A very important parameter of operational amplifier performance is <em>slew rate</em>. Describe what &quot;slew rate&quot; is, and why it is important for us to consider in choosing an op-amp for a particular application.</p>
<p>&quot;Slew rate&quot; is the maximum rate of voltage change over time (<span class="math">$dv \over dt$</span>) that an op-amp can output.</p>
<p>Ask your students why <span class="math">$dv \over dt$</span> might be an important parameter in a circuit? In what application(s) might we need the op-amp to &quot;swing&quot; its output voltage rapidly? In what application(s) might we not care about the op-ampâ€™s slew rate?</p>
