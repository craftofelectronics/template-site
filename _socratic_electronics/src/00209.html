<p>Suppose an inductor is connected directly to an adjustable-current source, and the current of that source is steadily <em>increased</em> over time. We know that an increasing current through an inductor will produce a magnetic field of increasing strength. Does this increase in magnetic field constitute an <em>accumulation</em> of energy in the inductor, or a <em>release</em> of energy from the inductor? In this scenario, does the inductor act as a <em>load</em> or as a <em>source</em> of electrical energy?</p>

<p>Now, suppose the adjustable current source is steadily <em>decreased</em> over time. We know this will result in a magnetic field of decreasing strength in the inductor. Does this decrease in magnetic field constitute an <em>accumulation</em> of energy in the inductor, or a <em>release</em> of energy from the inductor? In this scenario, does the inductor act as a <em>load</em> or as a <em>source</em> of electrical energy?</p>

<p>For each of these scenarios, label the inductor’s voltage drop polarity.</p>
<p>As the applied current increases, the inductor acts as a load, accumulating additional energy from the current source. Acting as a load, the voltage dropped by the inductor will be in the same polarity as across a resistor.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00209x03.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>As the applied current decreases, the inductor acts as a source, releasing accumulated energy to the rest of the circuit, as though it were a current source itself of superior current. Acting as a source, the voltage dropped by the inductor will be in the same polarity as across a battery, powering a load.</p>

<p>Relating the polarity of voltage across an inductor to a change of applied current over time is a complex concept for many students. Since it involves rates of change over time, it is an excellent opportunity to introduce calculus concepts (<span class="math">${d \over dt}$</span>).</p>
<p>Vitally important to students’ conceptual understanding of an inductor exposed to increasing or decreasing currents is the distinction between an electrical energy <em>source</em> versus a <em>load</em>. Students need to think &quot;battery&quot; and &quot;resistor,&quot; respectively when determining the relationship between direction of current and voltage drop. The complicated aspect of inductors (and capacitors!) is that they may switch character in an instant, from being a source of energy to being a load, and visa-versa. The relationship is not fixed as it is for resistors, which are always energy <em>loads</em>.</p>
