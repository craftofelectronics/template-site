<p>An extra feature you could add to the logic probe circuit is a <em>pulse indication</em> LED. This LED momentarily turns on whenever there is a transition from high-to-low or from low-to-high:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02912x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Actually, what the pulse indicator circuit detects is a transition to the &quot;indeterminate&quot; state, which always lies between &quot;high&quot; and &quot;low.&quot; A pulse indication feature is nice to have in some circumstances, since it shows the presence of pulses which may be too brief to light up either the &quot;high&quot; or &quot;low&quot; LED. The two additional NAND gates &quot;stretch&quot; the pulse time so that the &quot;pulse&quot; LED’s blink is long enough to see. The duration of the LED’s blink is set by resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>7</sub></span> and capacitor <span class="math"><em>C</em><sub>2</sub></span>.</p>
<p>Explain how the pulse indication circuitry works.</p>
<p>NAND gates <span class="math"><em>U</em><sub>4</sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>U</em><sub>5</sub></span> form a monostable multivibrator circuit. A low input sensed by <span class="math"><em>U</em><sub>4</sub></span> at the output of <span class="math"><em>U</em><sub>3</sub></span> (indicating an indeterminate state) forces <span class="math"><em>U</em><sub>4</sub></span> to output a high signal, which is inverted by <span class="math"><em>U</em><sub>5</sub></span> to energize the &quot;Pulse&quot; LED and also hold <span class="math"><em>U</em><sub>4</sub></span> in that state even when the output of <span class="math"><em>U</em><sub>3</sub></span> goes high again. This state cannot last indefinitely, though, because the RC network of <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>7</sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>C</em><sub>2</sub></span> brings the input of <span class="math"><em>U</em><sub>5</sub></span> to a low state over time, thus &quot;resetting&quot; the pulse indication circuit.</p>
<p>I recommend a 0.47 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>F capacitor for <span class="math"><em>C</em><sub>2</sub></span> and a 100 k<span class="math">Ω </span> resistor for <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>7</sub></span>. The added feature of a pulse indicator LED is particularly nice because it makes use of what would otherwise be unused gates in a 4011 CMOS NAND gate IC. The only added componentry is the fourth LED, current limiting resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>6</sub></span>, capacitor <span class="math"><em>C</em><sub>2</sub></span>, and resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>7</sub></span>.</p>
