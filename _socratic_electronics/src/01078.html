<p>This circuit shown here is for a <em>timing light</em>: a device that uses a pulsed strobe lamp to &quot;freeze&quot; the motion of a rotating object.</p>

<p>Which component(s) in this circuit form the oscillator section? What type of oscillator is used in this circuit? Which component values have a direct influence on the frequency of the flash tube’s output?</p>
<p>The heart of the oscillator circuit is unijunction transistor <span class="math"><em>Q</em><sub>1</sub></span>. Together with some other components (I’ll let you figure out which!), this transistor forms a <em>relaxation oscillator</em> circuit. <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span>, <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span>, and <span class="math"><em>C</em><sub>1</sub></span> have direct influence over the oscillation frequency.</p>
<p>Challenge question: what purpose does resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span> serve? It would seem at first glance that it serves no useful purpose, as potentiometer <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> is capable of providing any desired amount of resistance for the RC time constant circuit on its own – <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span>’s resistance is simply added to it. However, there is an important, practical reason for including <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span> in the circuit. Explain what that reason is.</p>
<p>Ask your students to explain what the other transistors do in this circuit. If time permits, explore the operation of the entire circuit with your students, asking them to explain the purpose and function of all components in it.</p>
<p>After they identify which components control the frequency of oscillation, ask them to specifically identify which direction each of those component values would need to be changed in order to increase (or decrease) the flash rate.</p>
