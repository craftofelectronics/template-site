<p>Calculate the total impedances (complete with phase angles) for each of the following capacitor-resistor circuits:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02109x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02109x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Have your students explain how they solved for each impedance, step by step. You may find different approaches to solving the same problem(s), and your students will benefit from seeing the diversity of solution techniques.</p>
