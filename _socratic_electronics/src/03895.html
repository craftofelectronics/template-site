<p>Identify at least one component fault that would cause the flip-flop to indicate &quot;clockwise&quot; all the time, regardless of encoder motion:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03895x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>For each of your proposed faults, explain <em>why</em> it will cause the described problem.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Phototransistor <span class="math"><em>Q</em><sub>1</sub></span> failed shorted.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span> failed open.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Flipflop <span class="math"><em>U</em><sub>1</sub></span> output failed high.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: explain why the presence of ambient light near the phototransistors could also cause this problem to occur.</p>
<p>Be sure to discuss with your students the reasons why their proposed faults would cause the stated problem.</p>
