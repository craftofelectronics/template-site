<p>A very important concept to understand in digital circuitry is the difference between <em>current sourcing</em> and <em>current sinking</em>. For instance, examine this open-collector TTL inverter gate circuit, connected to a load:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01258x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Open-collector gates are specially designated in their schematic symbols by a marker within the gate shape:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01258x03.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Is this gate circuit able to <em>source</em> load current, <em>sink</em> load current, or do both?</p>
<p>Open-collector gate circuits are only able to <em>sink</em> load current. They cannot &quot;source&quot; any load current at all.</p>
<p>Follow-up question #1: what would need to be added to the gate circuit shown, in order for it to have the ability to source load current as well as sink load current?</p>
<p>Follow-up question #2: explain how you would calculate current sinking ability of this logic gate circuit, if you were given the internal component values and parameters.</p>
<p>The very important concept of sourcing versus sinking is best understood from the perspective of <em>conventional</em> current flow notation. The terms seem backward when electron flow notation is used to track current through the output transistor.</p>
<p>One point of confusion I’ve experienced among students is that current may go either direction (in or out) of a gate with totem-pole output transistors (able to sink or source current). Some students seem to have a conceptual difficulty with current going <em>in</em> to the <em>output</em> terminal of a gate circuit, because they mistakenly associate the &quot;out&quot; in <em>out</em>put as being a reference to direction of current, rather than direction of information or data.</p>
<p>An analogy I’ve used to help students overcome this problem is that of two people carrying a long pole:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01258x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Suppose these people are in a dark, noisy room, and they use the pole as a means of simple communication between them. For example, one person could tug on the pole to get the other person’s attention. Perhaps they could even develop a simple code system for communicating thoughts (1 tug = hello ; 2 tugs = good-bye ; 3 tugs = I think this is a silly way to communicate ; 4 tugs = let’s leave this room ; etc.). If one of the persons <em>pushes</em> on the pole rather than <em>pulls</em> on the pole to get the other person’s attention, does the direction of the pole’s motion change the direction of the communication between the two persons? Of course not. Well, then, does the direction of current through the output terminal of a gate change the direction that <em>information</em> flows between two interconnected gates? Whether a gate sources current or sinks current to a load has no bearing on the &quot;output&quot; designation of that gate terminal. Either way, the gate is still &quot;telling the load what to do&quot; by exercising control over the load current.</p>
<p>Ask your students to explain what the term &quot;open-collector&quot; means with reference to a TTL logic gate. How does this type of gate compare with normal (&quot;totem pole&quot; output) TTL gates?</p>
