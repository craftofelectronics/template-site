<p>What causes harmonics to form in the output of a transistor amplifier circuit, if the input waveform is perfectly sinusoidal (free from harmonics)? Be as specific as you can in your answer.</p>
<p>Any feature (or fault) of the circuit causing imperfect signal reproduction will necessarily create harmonics, for it will turn a perfectly sinusoidal input signal into a distorted (non-perfect-sinusoidal) signal.</p>
<p>Discuss with your students the nature of harmonics: how <em>multiple</em> sinusoidal waveforms are necessarily contained in any periodic waveform that is not perfectly sinusoidal itself.</p>
