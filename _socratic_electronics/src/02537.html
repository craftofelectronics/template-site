<p>Calculate the necessary gain of the second-stage amplifier to give the whole circuit a voltage gain of 25 decibels, then translate all decibel figures into gain ratios:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02537x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Stage 1 gain = 18 dB = 7.94</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Stage 2 gain = 7 dB = 2.24</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Overall gain = 25 dB = 17.8</p>
<p>This question is nothing more than &quot;drill&quot; for students to practice decibel/ratio conversions.</p>
