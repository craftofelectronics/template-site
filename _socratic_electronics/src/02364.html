<p>Identify the &quot;normal&quot; status of each switch, whether it is <em>normally-open</em> (N.O.) or <em>normally-closed</em> (N.C.):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02364x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Based on the symbols shown, describe what physical condition results in the switch contacts being open, and what condition results in the switch contacts being closed, for each switch.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02364x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Temperature switch: <em>cold</em> = contacts closed, <em>hot</em> = contacts open</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Pushbutton switch: <em>unpressed</em> = contacts closed, <em>pressed</em> = contacts open</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Pressure switch: <em>no applied pressure</em> = contacts open, <em>pressure applied</em> = contacts closed</p>
<p>Discuss with your students the different types of switches shown in this question (not just their normal status, but what physical event actuates each type of switch). There are many, many different types of switches – far more than just the types actuated by a human hand!</p>
