<p>Calculate the end-to-end resistance of a 20 meter length of copper wire with a diameter of 0.05 cm. Use <span class="math">$1.678 \times 10^{-6} \&gt; \Omega \cdot \hbox{cm}$</span> for the specific resistance of copper.</p>
<p>1.709 <span class="math">Ω </span></p>
<p>Nothing to comment on here – just a straight-forward calculation of resistance. Students need to be careful of the <em>centimeter</em> dimension, though!</p>
