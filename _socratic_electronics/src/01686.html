<p>Use circuit simulation software to verify your predicted and measured parameter values.</p>
<p>Here, students must calculate values for <span class="math"><em>C</em><sub>1</sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> that will produce the <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>o</em><em>u</em><em>t</em></sub></span> waveshape specified in the &quot;Given conditions&quot; oscilloscope plot. The input signal, of course, is a square wave. Students must calculate the time constant of the circuit (<span class="math"><em>τ</em></span>) such that the pulse fully decays within the pulse width (half-period) of the square wave. With <span class="math">5<em>τ</em></span> being the accepted standard for full charge/discharge of a time-constant circuit, this is an easy calculation.</p>
<p>There are many different combinations of values for <span class="math"><em>C</em><sub>1</sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> possible for any given square-wave signal frequencies. The purpose of this exercise is for students to be able to predict and select practical component values from their parts kits.</p>
<p>An extension of this exercise is to incorporate troubleshooting questions. Whether using this exercise as a performance assessment or simply as a concept-building lab, you might want to follow up your students’ results by asking them to predict the consequences of certain circuit faults.</p>
