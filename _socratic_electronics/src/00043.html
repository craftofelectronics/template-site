<p>Define the following terms:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Frequency</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Wavelength</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Cycle</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Hertz</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Amplitude</p>
<p>These terms are very easy to find definitions for, from a wide variety of sources. I’ll let you discover what they mean for yourself!</p>
<p>The unit &quot;Hertz&quot; is an example of how an implicitly defined label like &quot;cycles per second&quot; (CPS) came to be replaced by one having no objective meaning at all. Similar to how &quot;Celsius&quot; replaced &quot;Centigrade&quot; as the official metric name for a unit of temperature measurement. Pardon me for stepping up on my soapbox here, but changes such as these really irritate me.</p>
<p>It is important to understand that these terms apply to non-electrical phenomena as well as electrical. The wide applicability of such terms allows for easier comprehension. Ask your students to give common examples of these terms in everyday life. Hint: music is an excellent context for this question!</p>
