<p>Students often mix up the identities of encoders, decoders, multiplexers, and demultiplexers. It is important for them to realize that while multiplexers and demultiplexers <em>contain</em> decoders, they are not the same as decoders (or encoders). In essence, muxes and demuxes &quot;steer&quot; signals to/from different locations, while encoders and decoders convert data from one format to another.</p>
