<p>Define the following noise types, according to how each one is generated in electronic circuits:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Shot noise</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Thermal (&quot;Johnson&quot;) noise</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Flicker (or 1/f) noise</p>
<p>Also, identify the major factor responsible for the amplitude of each noise type.</p>
<p><em>Shot noise</em> is generated by individual electrons &quot;jumping&quot; across some sort of barrier potential as they travel through a conducting substance. Shot noise is proportional to the amount of electric <em>current</em> going through a conductor.</p>
<p><em>Thermal noise</em>, also known as <em>Johnson noise</em>, is caused by the random motion of electrons due to thermal energy. As one might guess, this type of noise is proportional to conductor <em>temperature</em>.</p>
<p><em>Flicker noise</em>, or <em>1/f noise</em>, is characterized by a magnitude that is inversely proportional to frequency. Little is known about the origins of this type of noise, but it is proportional to the amount of DC <em>current</em>, just like shot noise, and so may be mitigated using the same controls.</p>
<p>Noise is a very complex subject in electrical engineering, and most likely beyond the scope of your students’ coursework. This question is really just scratching the surface of noise theory.</p>
<p>For a good overview of electrical noise, consult Texas Instruments’ online manual, <em>Op Amps For Everyone</em>, sections 10-1 through 10-12.</p>
