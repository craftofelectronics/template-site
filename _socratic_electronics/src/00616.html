<p>In very simple, qualitative terms, rate the impedance of capacitors and inductors as &quot;seen&quot; by low-frequency and high-frequency signals alike:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Capacitor as it &quot;appears&quot; to a low frequency signal: ( or ) impedance?</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Capacitor as it &quot;appears&quot; to a high frequency signal: ( or ) impedance?</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Inductor as it &quot;appears&quot; to a low frequency signal: ( or ) impedance?</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Inductor as it &quot;appears&quot; to a high frequency signal: ( or ) impedance?</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Capacitor as it &quot;appears&quot; to a low frequency signal: <em>high</em> impedance.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Capacitor as it &quot;appears&quot; to a high frequency signal: <em>low</em> impedance.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Inductor as it &quot;appears&quot; to a low frequency signal: <em>low</em> impedance.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Inductor as it &quot;appears&quot; to a high frequency signal: <em>high</em> impedance.</p>
<p>Challenge question: what does a capacitor &quot;appear&quot; as to a <em>DC</em> signal?</p>
<p>Ask your students how they arrived at their answers for these qualitative assessments. If they found difficulty understanding the relationship of frequency to impedance for reactive components, I suggest you work through the reactance equations qualitatively with them. In other words, evaluate each of the reactance formulae (<span class="math"><em>X</em><sub><em>L</em></sub> = 2<em>π</em><em>f</em><em>L</em></span> and <span class="math">$X_C = {1 \over {2 \pi f C}}$</span>) in terms of <span class="math"><em>f</em></span> increasing and decreasing, to understand how each of these components reacts to low- and high-frequency signals.</p>
