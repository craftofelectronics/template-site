<p>Operational amplifier circuits employing negative feedback are sometimes referred to as &quot;electronic levers,&quot; because their voltage gains may be understood through the mechanical analogy of a lever. Explain this analogy in your own words, identifying how the lengths and fulcrum location of a lever relate to the component values of an op-amp circuit:</p>

<p>The analogy of a lever works well to explain how the output voltage of an op-amp circuit relates to the input voltage, in terms of both magnitude and polarity. Resistor values correspond to <em>moment arm</em> lengths, while direction of lever motion (up versus down) corresponds to polarity. The position of the fulcrum represents the location of ground potential in the feedback network.</p>
<p>I found this analogy in one of the best books I’ve ever read on op-amp circuits: John I. Smith’s . Unfortunately, this book is out of print, but if you can possibly obtain a copy for your library, I highly recommend it!</p>
