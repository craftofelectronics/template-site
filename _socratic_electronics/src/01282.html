<p>Explain why it is generally a <em>very bad</em> design practice to connect the outputs of different logic gates together, like this:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01282x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>However, there are certain specific circumstances in which &quot;paralleling&quot; gate outputs is acceptable. For instance, it is okay to parallel two or more inverters, like this:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01282x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>No damage will be done if open-collector gate outputs are paralleled, either (although the resulting logic function may be strange):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01282x03.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>And finally, gates that have <em>tri-state</em> outputs may also have their outputs paralleled if certain precautions are taken:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01282x04.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>What, specifically, causes gates to be damaged by &quot;paralleling&quot; their outputs? Generally speaking, what principle must be followed in order to &quot;parallel&quot; logic gate outputs without risk of damage? Explain how each of the three acceptable &quot;paralleled&quot; scenarios shown here meet this criterion.</p>
<p>Suggestion: the issue of multiple gates having to output logic voltage signals onto common conductors (&quot;busses&quot;) is called <em>bus contention</em>. Try looking for this term in your research to see what useful information you find on paralleled gates!</p>
<p>Logic gates will be damaged if one tries to sink the output current sourced by another.</p>
<p>The given answer cuts to the heart of the matter, but I want students to elaborate on the details. Specifically, why each of the three acceptable paralleled circuits avoids risk of damage. Make sure you spend adequate time discussing &quot;tri-state&quot; outputs as well. Ask your students to explain what the three output states of a &quot;tri-state&quot; gate are.</p>
