<p>A very old but highly accurate technique for measuring voltage is to use a sensitive meter (a <em>galvanometer</em>) as a &quot;balance&quot; indicator between two voltage sources: the unknown source and a calibrated, adjustable source called the <em>standard</em>:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01730x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The technique is to adjust the standard voltage source until the galvanometer registers exactly zero. When this condition is met, the system is said to be &quot;balanced,&quot; indicating that the two voltage sources are equal in magnitude to each other. This voltage magnitude is then read from the calibrated adjustment dial on the standard source.</p>
<p>Explain how this voltage measurement technique exploits Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law, which states that the algebraic sum of all voltages in a loop must equal zero:</p>

<p>I’ll leave the answer for you to demonstrate!</p>
<p>Potentiometric voltage measurement is not only practical, but for quite a while in the early field of electrical measurements it was the <em>only</em> way to accurately measure voltage from &quot;weak&quot; (high-impedance) sources. It is still used today in electrical metrology, and serves as a simple application of KVL for students to examine.</p>
