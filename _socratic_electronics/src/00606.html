<p>If a capacitor and an inductor are connected in series, and energized by an AC voltage source with such a frequency that the reactances of each component are 125 <span class="math">Ω </span> and 170 <span class="math">Ω </span>, respectively, what is the total impedance of the series combination?</p>
<p>45 <span class="math">Ω </span> <span class="math">∠</span> 90<span class="math">$^{o}$</span></p>
<p>Now, of course, you are wondering: &quot;how can two series-connected components have a total impedance that is <em>less</em> than either of their individual impedances?&quot; Don’t series impedances add to equal the total impedance, just like series resistances? Be prepared to explain what is happening in this circuit, during discussion time with your classmates.</p>
<p>This question is an exercise in complex number arithmetic, and it is quite counter-intuitive at first. Discuss this problem in depth with your students, so that they are sure to comprehend the phenomenon of series-canceling impedances.</p>
