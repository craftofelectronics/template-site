<p>When you measure the low-voltage AC output of your transformer and compare that measurement to the rectified and filtered DC output voltage, you will notice something very counter-intuitive. The DC output voltage reading is substantially <em>greater</em> than the unrectified AC voltage from the transformer’s secondary winding!</p>
<p>Explain why this is, and then show mathematical calculations that relate the two voltage measurements together with reasonable accuracy.</p>
<p>This is something that catches almost all students by surprise when they first measure the voltages. I’ll give you a big hint why the rectified and filtered (DC) output voltage is so much greater than the unrectified (AC) secondary voltage: the AC voltage measurement you make with your voltmeter is most likely an <em>RMS</em> measurement, not a <em>peak</em> measurement.</p>
<p>Let students figure out this mystery on their own: it is one of those phenomena that really reveals the nature of RMS measurements in contrast to peak measurements.</p>
