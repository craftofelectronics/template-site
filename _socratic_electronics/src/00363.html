<p>Size the resistor in this voltage divider circuit to provide 5 volts to the load, assuming that the load will draw 75 mA of current at this voltage:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00363x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>As part of your design, include the power dissipation ratings of both resistors.</p>
<p>R = 264 <span class="math">Ω </span>. The 330 <span class="math">Ω </span> resistor must have a power dissipation rating of at least 3 watts, while the 264 <span class="math">Ω </span> resistor will fare well even with a (low) power dissipation rating of <span class="math">${1 \over 8}$</span> watt.</p>
<p>Ask your students what would change in this divider circuit if the load were to suddenly draw more, or less, current.</p>
