<p>The lines of a three-phase power system may be connected to the terminals of a three-phase motor in several different ways. Which of these altered motor connections will result in the motor reversing direction?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00419x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Examples #1 and #3 will reverse the motorâ€™s rotation (as compared to the original wiring). Example #2 will not.</p>
<p>It is helpful to review the concept of phase rotation sequences as a string of letters: A-B-C, or C-B-A. Although these two letter sequences are the most common for denoting the two different rotation directions, they are not the only sequences possible using three letters. For example, A-C-B, B-A-C, C-A-B, and B-C-A are also possibilities. Discuss with your students which of these letter sequences represents the same <em>direction</em> of rotation as A-B-C, and which represent the same direction of rotation as C-B-A. Then, ask your students how they might apply these letter sequences to the different wiring diagrams shown in the question.</p>
