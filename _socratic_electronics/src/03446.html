<p>Determine which way the movable iron piece needs to go in order to <em>brighten</em> the light bulb in this circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03446x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The movable piece needs to move to the <em>left</em>, creating a larger air gap between the poles of the U-shaped inductor core.</p>
<p>This question is an exercise in applying practical electromagnetic theory (namely, reluctance of an iron/air flux path) to inductance and inductive reactance. Ask your students to explain their reasoning step-by-step as they give their answers to this question.</p>
