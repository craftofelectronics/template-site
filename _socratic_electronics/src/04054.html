<p>The truth table shown here is for a 4-line to 16-line <em>binary decoder</em> circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{04054x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>For each of the sixteen output lines, there is a Boolean SOP expression describing its function. Just for example, write the Boolean expressions for output lines 2, 11, and 14.</p>
<p>Output line 2: <span class="math">$\overline{A}B \overline{C} \&gt; \overline{D}$</span></p>
<p>Output line 11: <span class="math">$A B \overline{C} D$</span></p>
<p>Output line 14: <span class="math">$\overline{A} B C D$</span></p>
<p>Follow-up question: based on what you see here, what kind of logic gate circuitry is a decoder such as this comprised of? You donâ€™t have to actually draw a schematic diagram, but just generally describe the circuitry necessary to implement sixteen different SOP expressions.</p>
<p>Nothing really complex or tricky here. Just a straightforward application of Boolean SOP expressions.</p>
