<p>Use Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law to calculate the magnitude and polarity of the voltage across resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>4</sub></span> in this resistor network:</p>

<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01728x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>In your discussion, be sure to explore more than one &quot;loop&quot; when using KVL. Not only does this demonstrate the arbitrary nature of your loop choice, but it also serves as a double-check for your work!</p>
<p>It is not necessary to know anything about series-parallel or even parallel circuits in order to solve the <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>4</sub></span>’s voltage – all one needs to know is how to use Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law.</p>
