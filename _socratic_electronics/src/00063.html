<p>Think of a way to re-wire the electrical system of this old automobile (with 6-volt light bulbs) so as to not require resistors between the loads and the generator/battery portion of the circuit (operating at 12 volts each).</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00063x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Connect the light bulb pairs in series instead of parallel. This way, each light bulb will receive 6 volts, with a total system voltage of 12 volts.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: there is a disadvantage of this strategy, though, and it concerns the safety of operating the automobile. Explain what this disadvantage is.</p>
<p>This solution works only because the load sets are in pairs, and because 6 + 6 = 12. One benefit of this solution is greater efficiency, as there are no resistors in the circuit to &quot;waste&quot; power by dissipating it in the form of heat. However, there is a disadvantage to doing things this way, as indicated by the follow-up question. Discuss this disadvantage with your students, reinforcing the idea that the most efficient engineering solutions may not be the best when assessed from other perspectives, such as safety!</p>
