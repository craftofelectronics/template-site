<p>Predict how the operation of this relaxation oscillator circuit will be affected as a result of the following faults. Consider each fault independently (i.e. one at a time, no multiple faults):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03749x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Capacitor <span class="math"><em>C</em><sub>1</sub></span> fails open:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Capacitor <span class="math"><em>C</em><sub>1</sub></span> fails shorted:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> fails open:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Solder bridge (short) past resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span>:</p>
<p>For each of these conditions, explain <em>why</em> the resulting effects will occur.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Capacitor <span class="math"><em>C</em><sub>1</sub></span> fails open: <em>Constant (unblinking) light from the neon bulb.</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Capacitor <span class="math"><em>C</em><sub>1</sub></span> fails shorted: <em>No light from the bulb at all.</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> fails open: <em>No light from the bulb at all.</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Solder bridge (short) past resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span>: <em>Very bright, constant (unblinking) light from the bulb, possible bulb failure resulting from excessive current.</em></p>
<p>The purpose of this question is to approach the domain of circuit troubleshooting from a perspective of knowing what the fault is, rather than only knowing what the symptoms are. Although this is not necessarily a realistic perspective, it helps students build the foundational knowledge necessary to diagnose a faulted circuit from empirical data. Questions such as this should be followed (eventually) by other questions asking students to identify likely faults based on measurements.</p>
