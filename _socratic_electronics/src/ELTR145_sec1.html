<p>The very wording of this &quot;difficult concept&quot; may seem difficult to the reader! What I am saying here is that latches and flip-flops are difficult to figure out because their outputs not only depend on the logic levels of the inputs, but also on the <em>previous</em> output states. For this reason, these devices fall into the category of &quot;state machines:&quot; they &quot;remember&quot; what logic state they were last in.</p>
<p>I have but one tool for you to use in understanding state machine circuits: the lowly timing diagram. Truth tables fail to fully capture the essence of state machines unless they are expanded to include column(s) showing the last output(s) as well as the inputs. Timing diagrams keep a record of a circuit’s last output states as you check to see what will happen for each new input condition. Learn how to draw and interpret timing diagrams, and you will have a powerful tool to apply toward the study of latches and flip-flop circuits!</p>
<p>Many students find the time-constant equation difficult because it involves exponents, particularly exponents of Euler’s constant <span class="math"><em>e</em></span>. This exponent is often expressed as a negative quantity, making it even more difficult to understand. The single most popular mathematical mistake I see students make with this equation is failing to properly follow algebraic order of operations. Some students try to overcome this weakness by using calculators which allow parenthetical entries, nesting parentheses in such a way that the calculator performs the proper order of operations. However, if you don’t understand order of operations yourself, you will not know where to properly place the parentheses. If you have trouble with algebraic order of operations, there is no solution but to invest the necessary time and learn it!</p>
<p>Beyond mathematical errors, though, the most common mistake I see students make with the time constant equation is mis-application. One version of this equation expresses increasing quantities, while another version expresses decreasing quantities. You must already know what the variables are going to do in your time-constant circuit before you know which equation to use! You must also be able to recognize one version of this equation from the other: not by memory, lest you should forget; but by noting what the result of the equation does as time (<span class="math"><em>t</em></span>) increases. Here again there will be trouble if you are not adept applying algebraic order of operations.</p>
