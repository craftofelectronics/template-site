<p>Write a truth table for each of the indicator lamps in the following ladder diagram, and determine which logic function (AND, OR, NAND, NOR, or NOT) best describes each lamp’s behavior with respect to the status of the input switches.</p>

<p>Each of the lamps exhibits the behavior of a &quot;NOR&quot; gate.</p>
<p>This question provides a good opportunity for students to practice analyzing relay logic circuits, and it also foreshadows DeMorgan’s Theorem in its dual implementation of the NOR function. Note to your students how more than one contact is being used on control relays CR1 and CR2!</p>
