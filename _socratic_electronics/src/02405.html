<p>Compare the relative magnitudes of each current in this bipolar transistor circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02405x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Which current is the smallest and which is the largest? Are there any two currents that are closer in magnitude than with the third? If so, which currents are they?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math"><em>I</em><sub><em>E</em></sub> &gt; <em>I</em><sub><em>C</em></sub> &gt;  &gt; <em>I</em><sub><em>B</em></sub></span><br /></p>
<p>Note the brief nature of the answer. This mathematical expression says it all, and it is a good review of inequality symbols.</p>
