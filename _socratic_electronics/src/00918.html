<p>Describe the operation of this diode testing circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00918x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Identify what the two light-emitting diodes (LEDs) will do when testing these three types of diodes:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Good diode</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Diode failed shorted</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Diode failed open</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Good diode: one LED lit</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Diode failed shorted: both LEDs lit</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Diode failed open: neither LED lit</p>
<p>Challenge question: this circuit not only detects the presence of a good diode, but it also has the ability to identify that diode’s polarity (which terminal is the cathode, and which terminal is the anode). Explain how the circuit is able to do this.</p>
<p>This simple yet ingenious circuit (not my design, lest you think I’m conceited) serves the purpose of illustrating diode rectification behavior, and provides a potential project for students to build and test.</p>
