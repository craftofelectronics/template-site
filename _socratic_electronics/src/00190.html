<p>Suppose a capacitor is connected directly to an adjustable-voltage source, and the voltage of that source is steadily <em>increased</em> over time. We know that an increasing voltage across a capacitor will produce an electric field of increasing strength. Does this increase in electric field constitute an <em>accumulation</em> of energy in the capacitor, or a <em>release</em> of energy from the capacitor? In this scenario, does the capacitor act as a <em>load</em> or as a <em>source</em> of electrical energy?</p>

<p>Now, suppose the adjustable voltage source is steadily <em>decreased</em> over time. We know this will result in an electric field of decreasing strength in the capacitor. Does this decrease in electric field constitute an <em>accumulation</em> of energy in the capacitor, or a <em>release</em> of energy from the capacitor? In this scenario, does the capacitor act as a <em>load</em> or as a <em>source</em> of electrical energy?</p>

<p>For each of these scenarios, label the direction of current in the circuit.</p>
<p>As the applied voltage increases, the capacitor acts as a load, accumulating additional energy from the voltage source. Acting as a load, the current going &quot;through&quot; the capacitor will be in the same direction as through a resistor.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00190x03.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>As the applied voltage decreases, the capacitor acts as a source, releasing accumulated energy to the rest of the circuit, as though it were a voltage source itself of superior voltage. Acting as a source, the current going &quot;through&quot; the capacitor will be in the same direction as through a battery, powering a load.</p>

<p>Relating the direction of current in a capacitor to a change of applied voltage over time is a complex concept for many students. Since it involves rates of change over time, it is an excellent opportunity to introduce calculus concepts (<span class="math">${d \over dt}$</span>).</p>
<p>Vitally important to studentsâ€™ conceptual understanding of a capacitor exposed to increasing or decreasing voltages is the distinction between an electrical energy <em>source</em> versus a <em>load</em>. Students need to think &quot;battery&quot; and &quot;resistor,&quot; respectively when determining the relationship between direction of current and voltage drop. The complicated aspect of capacitors (and inductors!) is that they may switch character in an instant, from being a source of energy to being a load, and visa-versa. The relationship is not fixed as it is for resistors, which are always energy <em>loads</em>.</p>
