<p>Predict how all component voltages and currents in this circuit will be affected as a result of the following faults. Consider each fault independently (i.e. one at a time, no multiple faults):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03704x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Zener diode fails shorted:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Zener diode fails open:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Series resistor fails open:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Series resistor fails shorted:</p>
<p>For each of these conditions, explain <em>why</em> the resulting effects will occur.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Zener diode fails shorted: <em>Little voltage across load, increased voltage across <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>s</em><em>e</em><em>r</em><em>i</em><em>e</em><em>s</em></sub></span>, increased current through source and <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>s</em><em>e</em><em>r</em><em>i</em><em>e</em><em>s</em></sub></span>.</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Zener diode fails open: <em>Increased voltage across load, decreased voltage across <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>s</em><em>e</em><em>r</em><em>i</em><em>e</em><em>s</em></sub></span>, decreased current through source and <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>s</em><em>e</em><em>r</em><em>i</em><em>e</em><em>s</em></sub></span>.</em></p>

<p><span class="math"> • </span> Series resistor fails shorted: <em>Full source voltage across load and <span class="math"><em>D</em><sub>1</sub></span>, greatly increased current through <span class="math"><em>D</em><sub>1</sub></span>, increased current through source, <span class="math"><em>D</em><sub>1</sub></span> will most likely overheat and fail.</em></p>
<p>The purpose of this question is to approach the domain of circuit troubleshooting from a perspective of knowing what the fault is, rather than only knowing what the symptoms are. Although this is not necessarily a realistic perspective, it helps students build the foundational knowledge necessary to diagnose a faulted circuit from empirical data. Questions such as this should be followed (eventually) by other questions asking students to identify likely faults based on measurements.</p>
