<p>It is sometimes said regarding electrical safety that, &quot;It’s not the <em>voltage</em> that will hurt you, it’s the <em>current</em>.&quot; Why then are there signs reading <strong>Danger: High Voltage</strong> near electrical substations and on large pieces of electrical equipment, rather than signs reading <strong>Danger: High Current</strong>?</p>
<p>Yes, it is electric <em>current</em> that does the damage when enough of it passes through a body, but current exists only when there is sufficient <em>voltage</em> to push it through that body’s <em>resistance</em>. Thus, there is no shock hazard when there is too little voltage present to force dangerous levels of current through a human body.</p>
<p>Ask students how this question relates to <em>Ohm’s Law</em>. If they don’t know what Ohm’s Law is yet, this is a really good place to begin exploring!</p>
