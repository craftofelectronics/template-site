<p>The <em>ignition coil</em> of a gasoline-powered internal combustion automobile engine is an example of a transformer, although it is not powered by alternating current. Explain how a transformer may be operated on electricity that is <em>not</em> AC:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00251x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>In order for a transformer to function, the primary winding current must change rapidly with regard to time. Whether this is a current that truly alternates, or just one that <em>pulses</em> in the same direction, is irrelevant.</p>
<p>Challenge question: is the wave-shape of the secondary voltage sinusoidal? Why or why not?</p>
<p>This is a very common application of transformer technology: the ignition &quot;coil&quot; used to ignite the air-fuel mixture inside a gasoline engineâ€™s combustion chamber. This question also addresses an issue sometimes misunderstood by students, that transformers are fundamentally AC devices, not DC.</p>
<p>It might be a good idea to have an automotive ignition coil available for for classroom demonstration. In lieu of a spark plug, a neon lamp may be used to indicate the presence of high voltage.</p>
<p>As for answering the challenge question, an oscilloscope will quickly prove the nature of the waveshape, for any transformer energized with pulsating DC.</p>
