<p>A very important concept in electronics is <em>modulation</em>. Explain what &quot;modulation&quot; means, and give one or two examples of it.</p>
<p><em>Modulation</em> is the act of impressing information onto an otherwise featureless stream of matter or energy, usually for the sake of communicating that information over a long distance. Radio is a very common example of modulation, but Iâ€™ll let you research a few more on your own!</p>
<p>There are many examples of modulation that students can find for presentation, and not all of them are electronic. Challenge them to think of scenarios other than modern electronic and/or optical communication schemes where modulation of some kind is employed.</p>
