<p>A style of counter circuit that completely circumvents the &quot;ripple&quot; effect is called the <em>synchronous</em> counter:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01396x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Complete a timing diagram for this circuit, and explain why this design of counter does not exhibit &quot;ripple&quot; on its output lines:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01396x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Challenge question: to <em>really</em> understand this type of counter circuit well, include propagation delays in your timing diagram.</p>
<p>The timing diagram shown here is ideal, with no propagation delays shown:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01396x03.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>However, even with propagation delays included (equal delays for each flip-flop), you should find there is still no &quot;ripple&quot; effect in the output count.</p>
<p>&quot;Walk&quot; through the timing diagram given in the answer, and have students explain how the logic states correspond to a two-bit binary counting sequence.</p>
