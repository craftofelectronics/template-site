<p>Write a single equation relating the resistance, specific resistance, length, and cross-sectional area of an electrical conductor together.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$R = \rho {l \over A}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Where,</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>R</em> = </span> Resistance, measured along the conductor’s length</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>ρ</em> = </span> Specific resistance of the substance</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>l</em> = </span> Length of the conductor</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>A</em> = </span> Cross-sectional area of the conductor</p>
<p>Follow-up question: algebraically manipulate this equation to solve for length (<span class="math"><em>l</em></span>) instead of solving for resistance (<span class="math"><em>R</em></span>) as shown.</p>
<p>A beneficial exercise to do with your students is to analyze this equation (and in fact, any equation) <em>qualitatively</em> instead of just <em>quantitatively</em>. Ask students what will happen to <span class="math"><em>R</em></span> if <span class="math"><em>ρ</em></span> increases, or if <span class="math"><em>l</em></span> decreases, or if <span class="math"><em>A</em></span> decreases. Many students find this a more challenging problem than working with real numbers, because they cannot use their calculators to give them qualitative answers (unless they enter random numbers into the equation, then change one of those numbers and re-calculate – but that is twice the work of solving the equation with one set of numbers, once!).</p>
