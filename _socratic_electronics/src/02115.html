<p>Determine the voltage dropped between points <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong> in this circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02115x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Hint: convert the parallel RC sub-network into a series equivalent first.</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>A</em><em>B</em></sub></span> = 10.491 volts</p>
<p>Although there are other ways to calculate this voltage drop, it is good for students to learn the method of series-parallel subcircuit equivalents. If for no other reason, this method has the benefit of requiring less tricky math (no complex numbers needed!).</p>
<p>Have your students explain the procedures they used to find the answer, so that all may benefit from seeing multiple methods of solution and multiple ways of explaining it.</p>
