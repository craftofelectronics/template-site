<p>Determine the final output states over time for the following circuit, built from D-type gated latches:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01363x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>At what specific times in the pulse diagram does the final output assume the input’s state? How does this behavior differ from the normal response of a D-type latch?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01363x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The final output assumes the same logic state as the input only when the enable input signal (B) <em>transitions</em> from &quot;high&quot; to &quot;low&quot;.</p>
<p>Note that by adding another latch, the overall behavior only slightly resembles the behavior of a D-type latch. With the addition of the second latch, we’ve changed this circuit into a <em>flip-flop</em>, specifically of the <em>master-slave</em> variety.</p>
