<p>What logic state does a floating CMOS gate input naturally assume? How does this compare against traditional TTL?</p>
<p>A floating CMOS gate does not assume <em>any</em> definite logic state! The logic state of a floating CMOS gate input is indeterminate.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: what state does a floating input assume for a high-speed CMOS (74HCxx) logic gate, which is designed to be an upgrade/replacement for traditional TTL gates?</p>
<p>Ask your students to explain their answer based on an analysis of the internals of a CMOS gate, versus the internals of a TTL gate. Memorization is not good enough â€“ students must grasp <em>why</em> these different logic families behave as they do.</p>
