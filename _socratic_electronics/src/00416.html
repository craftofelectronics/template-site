<p>How is polyphase (especially three-phase) electric power generated? Single-phase power is easy to understand, but how do we create three-phase AC voltage?</p>
<p>Polyphase AC voltages are usually created by special alternators, with different &quot;phase&quot; windings spaced around the circumference of the stator.</p>
<p>An illustration of polyphase alternator construction would be excellent to aid understanding of this concept. Your students should have no trouble finding illustrations of three-phase alternator design from textbooks and from the internet.</p>
