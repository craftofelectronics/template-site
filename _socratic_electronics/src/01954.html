<p>The cross-sectional area of wires is often measured in units of <em>circular mils</em> rather than square inches or other common area units. Explain how the &quot;circular mil&quot; is defined, and how it is calculated for round wires.</p>
<p>The &quot;circular mil&quot; is defined as the area of a circle with a diameter of <span class="math">${1 \over 1000}$</span> inch (a diameter of one <em>mil</em>).</p>
<p>Explain how this is analogous to the &quot;square inch&quot; being defined as the area of a square measuring one inch on a side. If you need to approach the definition in smaller conceptual steps, you might want to first define what a &quot;circular inch&quot; is before you define what a &quot;circular mil&quot; is.</p>
