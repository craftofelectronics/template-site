<p>A student builds this common-emitter amplifier so they he may amplify the audio signals from a microphone to power a speaker:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02235x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Unfortunately, the results are considerably less than expected: although some sound does come out of the speaker, it is not enough to be considered a success. Another student inspects the design and cryptically mumbles something about &quot;poor impedance matching,&quot; leaving the first student somewhat confused.</p>
<p>Explain what <em>impedance matching</em> means in this context, where the mis-match might be in this circuit, and what might be done to correct it.</p>
<p>I wonâ€™t reveal all the answers here, but I will provide a visual hint:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02235x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Ideally, the impedance-matching transformer will have a turns ratio of approximately 30:1 to match the output impedance of the amplifier circuit with the impedance of the speaker.</p>
<p>Note to your students that the addition of a transformer is not the only viable option for solving this impedance mis-match problem. One could add another stage of transistor amplification (of the right type, of course).</p>
<p>One point not touched upon in the answer is a possible mis-match of impedances between the microphone and the amplifier <em>input</em>. Since the microphone impedance was not specified, one cannot tell whether there is an impedance mis-match or not.</p>
