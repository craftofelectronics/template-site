<p>A popular strategy for AC induction motor control is the use of <em>variable frequency drive</em> units, or VFDs. Explain what varying the frequency of power to an AC induction motor accomplishes, and why this might be advantageous.</p>
<p>Variable frequency drives allow for the precise and efficient control of induction motor speed, which is not possible by other means.</p>
<p>Central to the answer of this question is the principle of a <em>rotating magnetic field</em> and how rotor speed is primarily a function of line frequency. While the internal details of a VFD are quite complex, the basic operating principle (and rationale) is not.</p>
