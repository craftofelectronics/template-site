<p>Define the following acronyms as they apply to digital logic circuits:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> ASIC</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> PAL</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> PLA</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> PLD</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> CPLD</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> FPGA</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> ASIC: <em>Application-Specific Integrated Circuit</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> PAL: <em>Programmable Array Logic</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> PLA: <em>Programmable Logic Array</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> PLD: <em>Programmable Logic Device</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> CPLD: <em>Complex Programmable Logic Device</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> FPGA: <em>Field-Programmable Gate Array</em></p>
<p>Follow-up question: now, comment on what each of these acronyms actually means, going beyond a mere recitation of the definition.</p>
<p>There is a veritable &quot;alphabet soup&quot; of acronyms in the world of programmable digital logic, and these are just a few. Going into the precise meaning of each acronym may not be the best use of time in answering this question, as there is little context in which to understand the meanings. Please do not attempt to do what so many technical courses do, and that is stuff students’ heads with acronym definitions to the neglect of actually <em>understanding</em> the various technologies. This question is intended only as an opening to an in-depth discussion of programmable logic, and not an end in itself!</p>
