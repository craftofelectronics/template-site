<p>Suppose you are building a cabin far away from electric power service, but you desire to have electricity available to energize light bulbs, a radio, a computer, and other useful devices. Determine at least three different ways you could generate electrical power to supply the electric power needs at this cabin.</p>
<p>There are several different devices capable of producing electrical power for this cabin of yours:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Engine-driven generator</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Solar cell</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Thermopile</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Windmill</p>
<p>For each of these devices, what is its operating principle, and where does it obtain its energy from?</p>
<p>For each of these electric power &quot;sources,&quot; there is a more fundamental source of energy. People often mistakenly think of generator devices as magic sources of energy, where they are really nothing more than energy <em>converters</em>: transforming energy from one form to another.</p>
