<p>A Rogowski coil has a mutual inductance rating of 5 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>H. Calculate the size of the resistor necessary in the integrator circuit to give the integrator output a 1:1 scaling with the measured current, given a capacitor size of 4.7 nF:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02703x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>That is, size the resistor such that a current through the conductor changing at a rate of 1 amp per second will generate an integrator output voltage changing at a rate of 1 volt per second.</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>R</em></span> = 1.064 k<span class="math">Ω </span></p>
<p>This question not only tests students’ comprehension of the Rogowski coil and its associated calculus (differentiating the power conductor current, as well as the need to integrate its output voltage signal), but it also tests students’ quantitative comprehension of integrator circuit operation and problem-solving technique. Besides, it gives some practical context to integrator circuits!</p>
