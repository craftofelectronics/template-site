<p>Explain what the <em>ohms-per-volt sensitivity</em> rating of an analog voltmeter means. Many analog voltmeters exhibit a sensitivity of 20 k<span class="math">Ω </span> per volt. Is it better for a voltmeter to have a high ohms-per-volt rating, or a low ohms-per-volt rating? Why?</p>
<p>The &quot;ohms-per-volt&quot; sensitivity rating of a voltmeter is an expression of how many ohms of input resistance the meter has, per range of volt measurement. The higher this figure is, the better the voltmeter.</p>
<p>If students have analog voltmeters in their possession (which I greatly encourage them to have), the ohms-per-volt sensitivity rating is often found in a corner of the meter scale, in fine print. If not, the rating should be found in the user’s guide that came with the meter.</p>
