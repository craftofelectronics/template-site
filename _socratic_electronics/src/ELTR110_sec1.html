<p>The very idea of assigning a fixed number for AC voltage or current that (by definition) constantly changes magnitude and direction seems strange. Consequently, there is more than one way to do it. We may assign that value according to the <em>highest</em> magnitude reached in a cycle, in which case we call it the <em>peak</em> measurement. We may mathematically integrate the waveform over time to figure the mean magnitude, in which case we call it the <em>average</em> measurement. Or we may figure out what level of DC (voltage or current) causes the exact same amount of average power to be dissipated by a standard resistive load, in which case we call it the <em>RMS</em> measurement. One common mistake here is to think that the relationship between RMS, average, and peak measurements is a matter of fixed ratios. The number &quot;0.707&quot; is memorized by every beginning electronics student as the ratio between RMS and peak, but what is commonly overlooked is that this particular ratio holds true <em>for perfect sine-waves only!</em> A wave with a different shape will have a different mathematical relationship between peak and RMS values.</p>
<p>These three terms represent different forms of opposition to electric current. Despite the fact that they are measured in the same unit (ohms: <span class="math">Ω </span>), they are not the same. Resistance is best thought of as electrical <em>friction</em>, whereas reactance is best thought of as electrical <em>inertia</em>. Whereas resistance creates a voltage drop by dissipating energy, reactance creates a voltage drop by <em>storing</em> and <em>releasing</em> energy. Impedance is a term encompassing both resistance and reactance, usually a combination of both.</p>
<p>A powerful tool used for understanding the operation of AC circuits is the <em>phasor diagram</em>, consisting of arrows pointing in different directions: the length of each arrow representing the amplitude of some AC quantity (voltage, current, or impedance), and the angle of each arrow representing the shift in phase relative to the other arrows. By representing each AC quantity thusly, we may more easily calculate their relationships to one another, with the phasors showing us how to apply trigonometry (Pythagorean Theorem, sine, cosine, and tangent functions) to the various calculations. An analytical parallel to the graphic tool of phasor diagrams is <em>complex numbers</em>, where we represent each phasor (arrow) by a pair of numbers: either a magnitude and angle (polar notation), or by &quot;real&quot; and &quot;imaginary&quot; magnitudes (rectangular notation). Where phasor diagrams are helpful is in applications where their respective AC quantities <em>add</em>: the resultant of two or more phasors stacked tip-to-tail being the mathematical sum of the phasors. Complex numbers, on the other hand, may be added, subtracted, multiplied, and divided; the last two operations being difficult to graphically represent with arrows.</p>
<p>Conductance, symbolized by the letter <span class="math"><em>G</em></span>, is the mathematical reciprocal of resistance (<span class="math">$1 \over R$</span>). Students typically encounter this quantity in their DC studies and quickly ignore it. In AC calculations, however, conductance and its AC counterparts (<em>susceptance</em>, the reciprocal of reactance <span class="math">$B = {1 \over X}$</span> and <em>admittance</em>, the reciprocal of impedance <span class="math">$Y = {1 \over Z}$</span>) are very necessary in order to draw phasor diagrams for parallel networks.</p>
<p>Oscilloscopes having more than one input &quot;channel&quot; share common ground connections between these channels. That is to say, with two or more input cables plugged into an oscilloscope, the &quot;ground&quot; clip of each input cable is electrically common with the ground clip of every other input cable. This can easily cause problems, as points in a circuit connected by multiple input cable ground clips will be made common with each other (as well as common with the oscilloscope case, which itself is connected to earth ground). One way to avoid unintentional short-circuits through these ground connections is to only connect <em>one</em> ground clip of the oscilloscope to the circuit ground, removing or tying back all the other inputs’ ground clips since they are redundant.</p>
