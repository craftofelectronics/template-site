<p>In some applications where transistors must amplify very high currents, bipolar transistors are paralleled together so that their current ratings add. When this is done, it is a good idea to use <em>swamping resistors</em> at the transistor emitter connections to help ensure even balancing of currents:</p>

<p>However, if we use MOSFETs instead of BJTs, we do not have to use swamping resistors:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03900x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Explain why MOSFETs do not require swamping resistors to help evenly distribute current, while BJTs do.</p>
<p>The amount of controlling voltage varies with temperature for the BJT, but not for the MOSFET.</p>
<p>The answer given here is purposefully vague. Let your students do the necessary research! Tell them that manufacturersâ€™ application notes are valuable sources of information for questions such as this.</p>
