<p>One of the practical uses of transformers is to adapt equipment to conditions not anticipated in their original design. For instance, a heating element (which is essentially nothing more than a resistor with an unusually high power dissipation rating) may need to be operated at a lower power dissipation than designed for.</p>
<p>For example, suppose you have a 1 kW electric heater rated for 208 volt operation, which you intend to operate at a reduced power dissipation of 750 watts. Calculate the proper amount of voltage you would need to achieve this reduced power dissipation, and explain how you could use a transformer to supply this reduced voltage to the heater.</p>
<p>The necessary voltage to make this 1 kW heater operate at only 750 W is approximately 180 volts.</p>
<p>Some students may struggle in calculating the necessary voltage, because this problem does not exactly match most voltage/current/power calculations problems theyâ€™ve seen in the past. The necessary math is almost trivial, but the &quot;trick&quot; is applying well-known equations to something unfamiliar. This is an excellent opportunity to discuss problem-solving strategies, so be sure to have students share their ideas on how to solve for the necessary voltage.</p>
