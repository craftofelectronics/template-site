<p>A special type of component called a <em>varactor diode</em> is used to electronically tune resonant circuits, given its ability to change capacitance with the application of a DC voltage. In the following schematic, the diode, capacitor, and inductor form a resonant circuit; the potentiometer creates a variable DC voltage to impress across the varactor diode (to change its capacitance); and the radio-frequency choke (&quot;RFC&quot;) inductor acts as a low-pass filter to block AC from getting to the potentiometer:</p>

<p>The equation for calculating the capacitance of a varactor diode is as follows:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$C_{diode} = {C_o \over {\sqrt{2V + 1}}}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Where,</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>C</em><sub><em>d</em><em>i</em><em>o</em><em>d</em><em>e</em></sub> = </span> Diode capacitance</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>C</em><sub><em>o</em></sub> = </span> Natural capacitance of diode with zero applied DC voltage</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>V</em> = </span> Applied DC voltage</p>
<p>Based on this information, determine which direction the potentiometer must be moved to <em>increase</em> the resonant frequency of the tuning circuit shown, and also explain why this is so.</p>
<p>Moving the pot wiper <em>up</em> increases the DC voltage across the varactor, which decreases its capacitance, which increases the resonant frequency of the LC circuit.</p>
