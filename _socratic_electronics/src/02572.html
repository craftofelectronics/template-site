<p>Identify what factor(s) determine the cutoff frequency of this passive filter circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02572x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Give an exact equation predicting this filter circuitâ€™s cutoff frequency, and also identify what type of filter it is.</p>
<p>This is a <em>high-pass</em> filter circuit, with a cutoff frequency of:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$f_{-3 dB} = {1 \over {2 \pi R C}}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Nothing fancy here, just a review of passive RC filter circuitry.</p>
