<p>Determine the RMS amplitude of this square-wave signal, as displayed by an oscilloscope with a vertical sensitivity of 0.5 volts per division:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01824x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The RMS amplitude of this waveform is 0.5 volt.</p>
<p>Many electronics students I’ve talked to seem to think that the RMS value of a waveform is always <span class="math">${\sqrt{2} \over 2}$</span>, no matter what the waveshape. Not true, as evidenced by the answer for this question!</p>
<p>Students must properly interpret the oscilloscope’s display in order to obtain the correct answer for this question. The &quot;conversion&quot; to RMS units is really non-existent, but I want students to be able to explain <em>why</em> it is and not just memorize this fact.</p>
