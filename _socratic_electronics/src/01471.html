<p>Draw the necessary connecting wires between flip-flops so that serial data is shifted from <em>right to left</em> instead of left to right as you may be accustomed to seeing in a shift register schematic:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01471x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Be sure to also note where data enters this shift register, and where data exits.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01471x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>This is a very simple question to answer. I present it here primarily so that students start thinking about how to <em>change</em> the direction of shift in a shift register circuit: a prelude to bidirectional shift register circuits.</p>
