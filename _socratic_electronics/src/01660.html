<p>You may use circuit simulation software to set up similar oscilloscope display interpretation scenarios, for practice or for verification of what you see in this exercise.</p>
<p>Use a sine-wave function generator for the AC voltage source, and be sure set the frequency to some reasonable value (well within the capability of both the oscilloscope and counter to measure).</p>
