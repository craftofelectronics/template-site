<p>Suppose we needed to determine the resistance of the light bulb in this circuit, while energized:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00307x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Now, we know we cannot simply connect an ohmmeter to an energized circuit, so how is it possible to obtain the resistance measurement we desire?</p>
<p>Measure voltage across the light bulb, and current through the light bulb, and then use Ohm’s Law to calculate filament resistance from these measurements.</p>
<p>Challenge question: explain how it would be possible to make these measurements without de-energizing the light bulb (not even once!).</p>
<p>Quite often, resistance measurements on a component are not practical because the component cannot be &quot;powered down,&quot; or perhaps because the component’s resistance is different when energized versus when de-energized (incandescent light bulbs being an excellent example of this). Knowing how to derive a resistance measurement from voltage and current measurements is a valuable skill.</p>
<p>The &quot;challenge&quot; question, to measure light bulb voltage and current without breaking the circuit, is also very practical. Once students figure out how to do this (no, using an inductive ammeter is <em>not</em> an acceptable answer!), it would be a great classroom activity to actually build such a circuit and have students practice the technique on it.</p>
