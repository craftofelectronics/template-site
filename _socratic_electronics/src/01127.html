<p>Radio-frequency amplifiers often use small inductors called <em>peaking coils</em> in the coupling circuitry between transistor stages. Describe the purpose of these inductors.</p>
<p><em>Peaking coils</em> are added to amplifier circuits to help counteract capacitive reactance at high frequencies.</p>
<p>The answer I gave for this question is very minimal, and is just enough to give your students a hint. Ask your students to explain why capacitive reactance is an issue in high-frequency transistor amplifier circuits, and why an inductor would be used to counter <span class="math"><em>X</em><sub><em>C</em></sub></span>. Also, ask if there are any disadvantages to inserting peaking coils into amplifier circuits.</p>
