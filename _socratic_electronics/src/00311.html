<p>What is a <em>megger</em>, and what type of resistance measurements would it typically be used for? Explain how the design of a &quot;megger&quot; differs from that of a normal ohmmeter.</p>
<p>Also, explain how improper use of a &quot;megger&quot; may actually be hazardous, either to the operator of the meter or to the circuit under test.</p>
<p>A &quot;megger&quot; is a high-range ohmmeter, typically used to measure the resistance of wire insulation. They utilize relatively high voltage (upwards of 1000 VDC) to measure resistance.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: what is a <em>hi-pot</em> meter, and what function is it typically used for?</p>
<p>Challenge question: why are special, high-voltage ohmmeters even needed? What’s wrong with using a regular ohmmeter that outputs just a few volts to measure resistance? What does the existence of these specialized ohmmeter types tell us about the nature of electrical resistance?</p>
<p>&quot;Meggers&quot; are very useful tools, but they can cause damage as well. Your students need to be aware of proper and improper uses of &quot;meggers&quot; before they are entrusted with the use of one.</p>
<p>The challenge question is worth exploring if time permits! In real life, the simplicity of Ohm’s Law is deceptive . . .</p>
