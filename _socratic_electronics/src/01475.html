<p>The following circuit is known as a <em>Johnson counter</em>:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01475x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Describe the output of this circuit, as measured from the <span class="math"><em>Q</em></span> output of the far right flip-flop, assuming that all flip-flops power up in the reset condition.</p>
<p>Also, explain what this modified version of the above Johnson counter circuit will do, in each of the five selector switch positions:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01475x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Johnson counters provide a divide-by-<span class="math"><em>n</em></span> frequency reduction. The second counter circuit shown has the ability to select different values for <span class="math"><em>n</em></span>.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, this circuit is a <em>divide-by-</em><span class="math">2<em>n</em></span> counter, because the frequency division ratio is equal to twice the number of flip-flops.</p>
<p>The final (#5) switch position is interesting, and should be discussed among you and your students.</p>
