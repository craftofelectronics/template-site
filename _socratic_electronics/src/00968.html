<p>The circuit shown here is a standard <em>push-pull</em> amplifier, comprised of a complementary pair of bipolar junction transistors:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00968x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Trace current in this circuit during periods of time when the instantaneous voltage of the signal source (<span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>i</em><em>n</em></sub></span>) is positive, and for those periods when it is negative. Determine at which times each of the transistors is &quot;on&quot; (conducting current).</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00968x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Follow-up question: would you classify this amplifier circuit as common-emitter, common-collector, or common-base? What kind of voltage gain would you expect this amplifier circuit to have?</p>
<p>Have your students trace current in the circuit on a diagram drawn on the whiteboard, so all can see the analysis. After analyzing its operation, ask them why they think this amplifier is called &quot;push-pull.&quot;</p>
<p>Another way to approach this circuit is from the perspective of current <em>sourcing</em> and current <em>sinking</em>. Which transistor sources current to the load resistor, and which transistor sinks current from the load resistor?</p>
