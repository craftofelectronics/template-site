<p>Suppose this battery and light bulb circuit failed to work:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00123x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Using a voltmeter, a technician measures 0 volts between the points C and H. What does this single measurement indicate about the condition of the circuit? Be as specific as you can.</p>
<p>Based on this one measurement, we are able to determine that there is definitely a problem in the circuit somewhere on the left-hand side (from points C and H, left). The exact nature of the problem is unknown, but there is definitely a problem of some nature in that half of the circuit.</p>
<p>There may or may not be a problem on the right-hand side of the circuit, as well. Given this single voltage measurement, we simply cannot tell.</p>
<p>There are times when a voltmeter indication of 0 volts is just as informative concerning a circuit fault as a non-zero measurement. In this case, the measurement tells us that a definite problem exists in one half of the circuit.</p>
