<p>Suppose an engineer designed a fire alarm system for a large warehouse, with multiple pushbutton switches connected to a single alarm siren:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00285x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Actuating any of the normally-open switches results in the alarm sounding. So far, so good.</p>
<p>Now, suppose that one of the wires connecting one side of several switches to the rest of the circuit breaks open. What will the result of this failure be?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00285x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The result of this wiring failure will be that the lower four switches will be non-functional.</p>
<p>The immediate and obvious conclusion is that four out of the five switches will be non-functional. However, it isn’t this consequence in itself that is the greatest problem. Rather, it is the <em>silence</em> of the failure – no one knows anything has failed, until they try to use one of the non-functional switches! Ask your students to explain what the essential nature of the problem is: what is it about this circuit’s operation that makes an &quot;open&quot; failure in the field wiring so dangerously inconspicuous?</p>
