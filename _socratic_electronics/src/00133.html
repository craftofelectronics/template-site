<p>When a pulse propagates down an &quot;unterminated&quot; cable and reaches an open-circuit, what does it do? Does it simply vanish, or does it go some place else?</p>
<p>A voltage pulse, upon reaching the open end of a cable, will be &quot;reflected&quot; back in the direction from which it came, its polarity being maintained while the current moves in the opposite direction.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00133x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>After the reflected pulse reaches the source, there will be maximum voltage at the source terminals and zero current in the cable.</p>
<p>To help answer this question, it is helpful to ask students how voltage and current relate to each other in an open-circuit condition (maximum voltage, zero current).</p>
