<p>Assuming that the output frequency of an alternator must remain constant (as is the case in national power systems, where the frequency of all power plants must be the same), how may its output voltage be regulated? In other words, since we do not have the luxury of increasing or decreasing its rotational speed to control voltage, since that would change the frequency, how can we coax the alternator to produce more or less voltage on demand?</p>
<p>Hint: automotive alternators are manufactured with this feature, though the purpose in that application is to maintain constant voltage despite changes in engine speed. In automotive electrical systems, the frequency of the alternatorâ€™s output is irrelevant because the AC is &quot;rectified&quot; into DC (frequency = 0 Hz) to charge the battery.</p>
<p>The rotor cannot be a permanent magnet, but must be an electromagnet, where we can change its magnetic field strength at will.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: how is it possible to conduct electric power to windings on a spinning rotor? Should we energize the rotor winding with AC or DC? Explain your answer.</p>
<p>Ask your students how this voltage regulation strategy compares with that of DC generators. Ask them to describe the difference between &quot;commutator bars&quot; and &quot;slip rings.&quot;</p>
