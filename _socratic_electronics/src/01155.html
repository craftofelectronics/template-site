<p>Find a printed circuit board with soldered components on it, and bring it with you to class for discussion. If you have access to a scrap bin from an electronics or computer repair shop, this would be an excellent place to find a printed circuit board. On your PCB, try to identify:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Number of layers on board</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> &quot;Traces&quot;</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> &quot;Lands&quot;</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Cold solder joints (if any)</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Solder bridges (if any)</p>
<p>Nothing to answer here!</p>
<p>Follow-up question: be sure you know what each of these terms (&quot;trace&quot;, &quot;cold solder joint&quot;, &quot;solder bridge&quot;, etc.) means.</p>
<p>The purpose of this question is to get students to kinesthetically interact with the subject matter. It may seem silly to have students engage in a &quot;show and tell&quot; exercise, but I have found that activities such as this greatly help some students. For those learners who are kinesthetic in nature, it is a great help to actually <em>touch</em> real components while they’re learning about their function.</p>
