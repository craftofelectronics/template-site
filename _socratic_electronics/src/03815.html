<p>An older microphone technology is the <em>carbon</em> microphone. Explain how this type of microphone worked, and why it was so simple to use in a circuit.</p>
<p>A carbon microphone generates a changing <em>resistance</em> representing sound wave oscillations. These microphones could be used as easily as this, with no amplifier circuit necessary:</p>
