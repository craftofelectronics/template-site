<p>Also, explain how to derive the voltage gain equation for this amplifier:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$A_V = {R_C \over {r'_e}}$</span><br /></p>
<p>This is a <em>common-base</em> amplifier circuit, and it is noninverting. Here is a schematic hint for explaining why the voltage gain formula is as it is. Note that the transistor is modeled here as a resistance and a controlled current source:</p>

<p>In discussion with your students, analyze the response of this single-transistor amplifier circuit for a variety of input voltages. In other words, perform a <em>thought experiment</em> to re-familiarize them with the behavior of this transistor amplifier configuration. Plot the input and output voltages, if necessary, on a graph. Discuss what the term &quot;noninverting&quot; means in this context.</p>
