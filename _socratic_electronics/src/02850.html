<p>An arithmetic trick often used when working with the metric system is multiplication-by-ten and division-by-ten via shifting of the decimal point. A similar &quot;trick&quot; may be applied to binary numbers, with similar results.</p>
<p>Determine what sort of multiplication or division is accomplished when the &quot;binary point&quot; is shifted in a binary number. Research the datasheet of an arithmetic logic unit (ALU) circuit to see if and how this function is implemented.</p>
<p>Shifting the &quot;binary point&quot; results in either multiplication or division by two. A multiplicative shift is performed by the 74AS181 ALU by arithmetic function selection <span class="math">1100<sub>2</sub></span> (C<span class="math">$_{16}$</span>).</p>
<p>Challenge question: explain how multiplication or division by <em>any</em> binary quantity may be accomplished using successive bit-shifts and additions. For example, show what steps you could take to multiply any binary number by five (<span class="math">101<sub>2</sub></span>), using only &quot;binary point&quot; shifting and addition(s).</p>
<p>A lot of arithmetic tricks existing in the decimal numeration system are applicable, with slight revision, in the binary numeration system as well. This is a popular one, and often used by shrewd computer programmers to execute fast multiply-by-two or divide-by-two operations when &quot;conventional&quot; multiplication commands take more time.</p>
