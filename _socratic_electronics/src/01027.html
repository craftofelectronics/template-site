<p>What is the typical forward voltage drop for a light-emitting diode? What is the typical forward current for an LED?</p>
<p>LED forward current is 20 mA. Forward voltage varies with color.</p>
<p>Be sure to ask students where they obtained their information, and what some of the forward voltage drops are for different color LEDs.</p>
