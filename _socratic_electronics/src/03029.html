<p>Complete the schematic diagram, showing how two momentary-contact pushbutton switches (&quot;Start&quot; and &quot;Stop&quot;), complete with any necessary pullup or pulldown resistors, could be connected to the inputs of this S-R latch to control a DC electric motor:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03029x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Note that the Reset input is active-low, while the Set input is active-high, and also that the transistor is controlled by the <span class="math">$\overline{Q}$</span> output. Donâ€™t forget to label which pushbutton switch is &quot;Start&quot; and which is &quot;Stop&quot;!</p>
<p>This is one possible solution. Other valid solutions exist as well!</p>
