<p>Identify at least two independent component faults which could cause this square root extraction circuit to always output 0 volts instead of the square root of input voltage <span class="math"><em>x</em></span> as it should:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03806x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Explain why each of your proposed faults would cause the output to stay at 0 volts.</p>
<p>Here are just a few possibilities: resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span> failed open, solder bridge across resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>3</sub></span>, <span class="math"><em>Q</em><sub>2</sub></span> failed open.</p>
<p>Students will likely identify opamp <span class="math"><em>U</em><sub>3</sub></span> as a potential fault, but this is really too easy. Encourage them to seek more <em>interesting</em> fault possibilities!</p>
