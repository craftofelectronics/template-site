<p>A numeration system often used as a &quot;shorthand&quot; way of writing large binary numbers is the <em>octal</em>, or base-eight, system.</p>
<p>Based on what you know of place-weighted numeration systems, describe how many valid ciphers exist in the octal system, and the respective &quot;weights&quot; of each place in an octal number.</p>
<p>Also, perform the following conversions:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math">35<sub>8</sub></span> into decimal:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math">16<sub>10</sub></span> into octal:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math">110010<sub>2</sub></span> into octal:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math">51<sub>8</sub></span> into binary:</p>
<p>There are only eight valid ciphers in the octal system (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7), with each successive place carrying eight times the &quot;weight&quot; of the place before it.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math">35<sub>8</sub></span> into decimal: <span class="math">29<sub>10</sub></span></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math">16<sub>10</sub></span> into octal: <span class="math">20<sub>8</sub></span></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math">110010<sub>2</sub></span> into octal: <span class="math">62<sub>8</sub></span></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math">51<sub>8</sub></span> into binary: <span class="math">101001<sub>2</sub></span></p>
<p>Follow-up question: why is octal considered a &quot;shorthand&quot; notation for binary numbers?</p>
<p>There are many references from which students may learn to perform these conversions. You assistance should be minimal, as these procedures are simple to comprehend and easy to find.</p>
