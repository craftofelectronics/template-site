<p>A potential problem for power MOSFETs is <em><span class="math">${dv \over dt}$</span> induced turn-on</em>. Explain why a MOSFET may turn on when itâ€™s not supposed to, given an excessive <span class="math">${dv \over dt}$</span> condition.</p>
<p>If the drain voltage rate-of-change over time (<span class="math">$dv \over dt$</span>) is excessive, the transistor may turn on due to the coupling effect of gate-to-drain capacitance (<span class="math"><em>C</em><sub><em>G</em><em>D</em></sub></span>).</p>
<p>Challenge question: draw an equivalent schematic diagram showing the parasitic <span class="math"><em>C</em><sub><em>G</em><em>D</em></sub></span> capacitance, and write the equation relating capacitive current to instantaneous voltage change over time.</p>
<p>This question is a good review of capacitor theory and calculus notation. Ask your students to explain exactly what <span class="math">${dv \over dt}$</span> means, and how it relates to current in a circuit containing capacitance.</p>
<p>The problem of dv/dt induced turn-on is not unique to power MOSFETs. Various thyristors, most notably SCRs and TRIACs, also exhibit this problem.</p>
