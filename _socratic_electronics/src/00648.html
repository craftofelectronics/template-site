<p>The following circuit is a simple <em>mixer</em> circuit, combining three AC voltage signals into one, to be measured by an oscilloscope:</p>

<p>Draw a schematic diagram of this circuit, to make it easier to analyze.</p>
<p>Is it possible to filter the three constituent input signals from each other in the resulting output signal, or are they irrevocably affected by one another when they &quot;mix&quot; together in this resistor network? How does the <em>superposition principle</em> relate to the operation of a mixer circuit like this?</p>
<p>What if the mixing circuit contains capacitors and inductors rather than resistors? Does the same principle apply? Why or why not?</p>

<p>The &quot;superposition principle&quot; states that when two or more waveforms mix together in a linear network, the result is the sum of the waveforms. That is, the waveforms simply add up to make a total, and are not &quot;irrevocably affected&quot; by one another. The question, then, is really: what constitutes a <em>linear</em> network?</p>
<p>It is no coincidence that the &quot;superposition principle&quot; sounds a lot like the &quot;superposition theorem&quot; learned as a network analysis technique: consider the effects of all power sources one at a time, and add those effects together to determine the final result.</p>
<p>The matter of &quot;irrevocable influence&quot; is important to us because it dictates how difficult it would be to separate the mixed signals from each other. When external noise couples to a circuit through capacitive or inductive coupling, can we filter out the noise and obtain the true signal again, or has the signal been corrupted in such a way that restoration is impossible by mere filtering? The key to answering this question is whether or not the &quot;network&quot; formed from parasitic capacitive/inductive coupling is linear. Discuss with your students what determines linearity in a math equation, and apply these criteria to the equations describing resistor, capacitor, and inductor behavior.</p>
