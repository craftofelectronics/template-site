<p>Draw an electrical schematic diagram of a circuit where a battery provides electrical energy to a light bulb.</p>
<p>This schematic diagram is not the only valid way to show a battery powering a light bulb:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00007x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Other orientations of the components within the diagram are permissible. What matters, though, is for there to be a single, continuous path for electric current from the battery, to the light bulb, and back to the other terminal of the battery.</p>
<p>Impress upon the students the importance of learning to &quot;communicate&quot; in the language of schematic diagrams. The symbols and conventions learned here are international, and not limited to use in the United States.</p>
