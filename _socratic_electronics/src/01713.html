<p>When an electric current travels through an electrical resistance, not only will there be a voltage &quot;drop&quot; across that resistance (<span class="math"><em>V</em> = <em>I</em><em>R</em></span>), but there will also be energy dissipated by that resistance. We describe the rate of energy dissipation over time as <em>power</em> (<span class="math"><em>P</em></span>), and we express power in the unit of the <em>watt</em> (W).</p>
<p>Write the equation relating power to voltage and current, for an electrical resistance. Also, describe what physical form this dissipated energy usually takes.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math"><em>P</em> = <em>I</em><em>V</em></span><br /></p>
<p>Energy dissipated by an electrical resistance is usually manifest as <em>heat</em>, although sometimes it is also in the form of <em>light</em>.</p>
<p>Most people, even if they have no prior experience with electric circuit analysis, have some sense of what a &quot;Watt&quot; is, because so many consumer-grade appliances are rated in watts (light bulbs, heaters, blow driers, etc.). Use these examples as context for your discussion on electric power.</p>
