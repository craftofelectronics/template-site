<p>A helpful analogy for a shift register is a <em>conveyor belt</em>. Examine this illustration showing a single conveyor belt at four different times, and determine which of the following shift register operations the sequence represents:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Parallel-in, serial-out</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Parallel-in, parallel-out</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Serial-in, serial-out</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Serial-in, parallel-out</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02985x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>This is a <em>parallel-in, serial-out</em> shift register analogy, with each box arriving on the conveyor belt one at a time, but leaving together as a group.</p>
<p>Some analogies can be very helpful to students as they learn new concepts. I have found that conveyor belts work very well to illustrate the different types of shift register behaviors.</p>
