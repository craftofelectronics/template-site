<p>Use circuit simulation software to verify your predicted and actual truth tables.</p>
<p>Pushbutton switches are recommended over toggle switches for demonstrating a latch circuit. When the contacts are momentary, the latching characteristics of the circuit becomes more evident to see.</p>
<p>If students use LEDs to indicate the <span class="math"><em>Q</em></span> and <span class="math">$\overline{Q}$</span> output states, they may experience trouble with the circuit not latching as it should. This is an excellent example of gate output <em>loading</em>, and the importance of proper logic level voltages. If such problems are encountered, advise the student(s) to use over-sized (too large) LED dropping resistors. This will cause the LEDs to be dim, but restore workable voltage levels so that &quot;high&quot; output states are actually interpreted as &quot;high&quot; when fed back to the gate inputs.</p>
