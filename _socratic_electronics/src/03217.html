<p>Synchronous AC motors operate with zero <em>slip</em>, which is what primarily distinguishes them from induction motors. Explain what &quot;slip&quot; means for an induction motor, and why synchronous motors do not have it.</p>
<p>Synchronous motors do not slip because their rotors are magnetized so as to always follow the rotating magnetic field precisely. Induction motor rotors are become magnetized by induction, necessitating a difference in speed (&quot;slip&quot;) between the rotating magnetic field and the rotor.</p>
<p>The concept of &quot;slip&quot; is confusing to many students, so be prepared to help them understand by way of multiple explanations, Socratic questioning, and perhaps live demonstrations.</p>
