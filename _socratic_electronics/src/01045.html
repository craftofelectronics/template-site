<p>Describe, step-by-step, the steps required to calculate all currents and voltage drops in a DC network using the <em>Branch Current Method</em>.</p>
<p>There are several textbooks and other references delineating the steps required in this analysis method. I leave the task of researching these steps to you!</p>
<p>Students may find slight differences between variations of the &quot;Branch Current&quot; method of analysis described in different references. However, these differences are of no consequence.</p>
