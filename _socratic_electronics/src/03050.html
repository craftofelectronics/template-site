<p>Some programmable logic devices (and PROM memory devices as well) use tiny fuses which are intentionally &quot;blown&quot; in specific patterns to represent the desired program. Programming a device by blowing tiny fuses inside of it carries certain advantages and disadvantages – describe what some of these are.</p>
<p>Certainly, the stored program will be nonvolatile, but it will also be read-only. This is why fuse-programmed devices are sometimes called &quot;OTP&quot;. (I’ll let you research what that acronym means.)</p>
<p>It is interesting to mention that some programmable devices (Texas Instruments’ TIBPAL series, for example) are built with a &quot;security fuse&quot; inside which prevents anyone from reverse-engineering a programmed chip!</p>
