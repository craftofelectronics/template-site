<p>In this circuit, an op-amp turns on an LED if the proper input voltage conditions are met:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00801x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Trace the complete path of current powering the LED. Where, exactly, does the LED get its power from?</p>
<p>The arrows shown in this diagram trace &quot;conventional&quot; current flow, not electron flow:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00801x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The important thing to note here is that the load current does not pass through either of the op-amp’s input terminals. All load current is sourced by the op-amp’s power supply! Discuss the importance of this fact with your students.</p>
