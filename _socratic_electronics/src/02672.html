<p>Identify what type of oscillator circuit this is, and write an equation describing its operating frequency:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02672x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>This is a <em>Wien bridge</em> opamp oscillator, and its operating frequency is determined in the same way as a discrete-transistor Wien bridge oscillator circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$f = {1 \over {2 \pi R C}}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Follow-up question: based on your analysis of the circuit, how much phase shift does the Wien bridge circuit introduce into the feedback signal?</p>
<p>Unlike some discrete transistor oscillator circuits, this Wien bridge is a complete and full Wien bridge, and not a &quot;half-bridge&quot;. For an example of a Wien <em>half</em>-bridge circuit, look at this (the Wien bridge components shown in a different color):</p>
