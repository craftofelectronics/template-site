<p>Determine the frequency spectrum for a high-frequency, sine wave &quot;carrier&quot; signal that is <em>amplitude-modulated</em> (AM) by an audio-frequency sine wave signal, as the following block diagram shows:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02271x04.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The spectra for these respective waveforms are shown individually:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02271x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02271x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Plot the modulated signal spectrum here:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02271x05.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02271x03.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Follow-up question: if the modulating (audio) signal were increased in frequency, what would the sideband spectra do?</p>
<p>The purpose of this question is to get students to recognize where sidebands come from, and how they relate to the frequency spectrum of the amplitude-modulated carrier wave.</p>
<p>In case anyone happens to ask, the symmetrical positioning of the sidebands around the carrier on the answer spectrum implies a <em>linear</em> frequency scale.</p>
