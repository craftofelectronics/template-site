<p>A Scottish physicist named James Clerk Maxwell made an astonishing theoretical prediction in the nineteenth century, which he expressed with these two equations:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\oint {\bf E} \cdot d{\bf l} = - {d \Phi_B \over dt}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\oint {\bf B} \cdot d{\bf l} = \mu_0 I + \mu_0 \epsilon_0 {d \Phi_E \over dt}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The first equation states that an electric field <span class="math">$({\bf E})$</span> will be produced in open space by a changing magnetic flux <span class="math">$\left({d \Phi_B \over dt}\right)$</span>. The second equation states than a magnetic field <span class="math">$({\bf B})$</span> will be produced in open space either by an electric current (<span class="math"><em>I</em></span>) or by a changing electric flux <span class="math">$\left({d \Phi_E \over dt}\right)$</span>. Given this complementary relationship, Maxwell reasoned, it was possible for a changing electric field to create a changing magnetic field which would then create another changing electric field, and so on. This cause-and-effect cycle could continue, ad infinitum, with fast-changing electric and magnetic fields radiating off into open space without needing wires to carry or guide them. In other words, the complementary fields would be self-sustaining as they traveled.</p>
<p>Explain the significance of Maxwell’s prediction, especially as it relates to electronics.</p>
<p>What James Clerk Maxwell predicted was the existence of <em>electromagnetic waves</em>, the lowest-frequency type we commonly refer to as <em>radio waves</em>.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: name the scientist who first experimentally confirmed Maxwell’s prediction of electromagnetic waves.</p>
<p>Not only does this question relate the concept of radio waves to concepts your students should already be familiar with (electric and magnetic fields), but it also introduces a piece of amazing scientific history. That radio waves were first predicted mathematically rather than discovered accidently by experiment is both astonishing and enlightening.</p>
<p>You may find that one or more of your brighter students notice Maxwell’s prediction relates a change in one type of field to a static magnitude of the other (i.e. <span class="math">$E \propto {d\Phi_B \over dt}$</span> and <span class="math">$B \propto {d\Phi_E \over dt}$</span>), and that this makes it difficult to see how one changing field could create another <em>changing</em> field. If anyone asks this question, point out to them that there is a set of similar mathematical functions related to one another by derivatives, and they are:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\sin t = - {d \over dt} \cos t  \hbox{\hskip 100pt}  \cos t = {d \over dt} \sin t$</span><br /></p>
<p>Does anything look familiar (omitting the <span class="math"><em>μ</em><sub>0</sub><em>I</em></span> term from the second equation)?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\oint {\bf E} \cdot d{\bf l} = - {d \Phi_B \over dt}  \hbox{\hskip 100pt}  \oint {\bf B} \cdot d{\bf l} =  \mu_0 \epsilon_0 {d \Phi_E \over dt}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Since we know electric flux is related to electric field by geometry (<span class="math">$\Phi_E = \int {\bf E} \cdot d{\bf A}$</span>) and magnetic flux is related to magnetic field by geometry as well (<span class="math">$\Phi_B = \int {\bf B} \cdot d{\bf A}$</span>), we may write the following proportionalities:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\Phi_E \propto - {d \Phi_B \over dt}  \hbox{\hskip 100pt}  \Phi_B \propto {d \Phi_E \over dt}$</span><br /></p>
<p><em>Now</em> do things look similar to the sine/cosine derivative relationship? Thus, if the electric flux <span class="math">Φ <sub><em>E</em></sub></span> oscillates as a sine wave, the magnetic flux <span class="math">Φ <sub><em>B</em></sub></span> will oscillate as a cosine wave, and so on.</p>
