<p>The formula for calculating voltage across a resistor in a series circuit is as follows:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$V_R = V_{total}\left(R \over R_{total}\right)$</span><br /></p>
<p>In a simple-series circuit with one voltage source and three resistors, we may re-write this formula to be more specific:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$V_{R1} = V_{source}\left(R_1 \over {R_1 + R_2 + R_3}\right)$</span><br /></p>
<p>Suppose we have such a series circuit with a source voltage of 15 volts, and resistor values of <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> = 1 k<span class="math">Ω </span> and <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span> = 8.1 k<span class="math">Ω </span>. Algebraically manipulate this formula to solve for <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>3</sub></span> in terms of all the other variables, then determine the necessary resistance value of <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>3</sub></span> to obtain a 0.2 volt drop across resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span>.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$R_3 = V_{source}\left({R_1 \over V_{R1}}\right) - (R_1 + R_2)$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>3</sub></span> = 65.9 k<span class="math">Ω </span></p>
<p>This question provides students with another practical application of algebraic manipulation. Ask individual students to show their steps in manipulating the voltage divider formula to solve for <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>3</sub></span>, so that all may see and learn.</p>
