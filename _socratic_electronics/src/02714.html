<p>One of the &quot;rules&quot; we apply to operational amplifier circuits regards the input currents:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02714x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Explain what this rule is. How much input current do we typically have through each input terminal of an operational amplifier?</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>I</em><sub><em>i</em><em>n</em><em>p</em><em>u</em><em>t</em></sub></span> = 0 mA</p>
<p>Actually, we <em>do</em> have a very small input current on each terminal, but it is usually so small that we can safely ignore it in most calculations.</p>
