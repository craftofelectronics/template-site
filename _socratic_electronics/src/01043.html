<p>Write two KVL loop equations for this circuit, using <span class="math"><em>I</em><sub>1</sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>I</em><sub>2</sub></span> as the only variables:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01043x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>KVL equation for left-hand loop:</p>
<p><span class="math">6 − 1000<em>I</em><sub>1</sub> − 1000(<em>I</em><sub>1</sub> + <em>I</em><sub>2</sub>) + 1 = 0</span></p>
<p>KVL equation for right-hand loop:</p>
<p><span class="math">7. 2 − 1000<em>I</em><sub>2</sub> − 1000(<em>I</em><sub>1</sub> + <em>I</em><sub>2</sub>) + 1 = 0</span></p>
<p>Follow-up question: what are the values of <span class="math"><em>I</em><sub>1</sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>I</em><sub>2</sub></span>, based on this system of equations?</p>
<p>Students’ equations may not look exactly like these, depending on how they &quot;stepped&quot; around the loops tallying voltage drops. So long as they are all able to reach the same answers for <span class="math"><em>I</em><sub>1</sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>I</em><sub>2</sub></span>, it does not matter. In fact, it is a good thing to have different students propose different forms of the equations to demonstrate that the same answers are obtained every time.</p>
