<p><em>Radio waves</em> are comprised of oscillating electric and magnetic fields, which radiate away from sources of high-frequency AC at (nearly) the speed of light. An important measure of a radio wave is its <em>wavelength</em>, defined as the distance the wave travels in one complete cycle.</p>
<p>Suppose a radio transmitter operates at a fixed frequency of 950 kHz. Calculate the approximate wavelength (<span class="math"><em>λ</em></span>) of the radio waves emanating from the transmitter tower, in the metric distance unit of meters. Also, write the equation you used to solve for <span class="math"><em>λ</em></span>.</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>λ</em> ≈ </span> 316 meters</p>
<p>I’ll let you find the equation on your own!</p>
<p>I purposely omit the velocity of light, as well as the time/distance/velocity equation, so that students will have to do some simple research this calculate this value. Neither of these concepts is beyond high-school level science students, and should pose no difficulty at all for college-level students to find on their own.</p>
