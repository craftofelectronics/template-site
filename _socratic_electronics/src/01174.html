<p>Suppose that diode D1 in this precision rectifier circuit fails open. What effect will this have on the output voltage?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01174x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Hint: if it helps, draw a table of figures relating <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>i</em><em>n</em></sub></span> with <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>o</em><em>u</em><em>t</em></sub></span>, and base your answer on the tabulated results.</p>
<p>Instead of the output voltage remaining at exactly 0 volts for any positive input voltage, the output will be equal to the (positive) input voltage, assuming it remains unloaded as shown.</p>
<p>Challenge question: what mathematical function does this circuit perform, with diode D1 failed open?</p>
<p>Note that the given failure does not render the circuit useless, but transforms its function into something different! This is an important lesson for students to understand: that component failures may not always results in complete circuit non-function. The circuit may continue to function, just differently. And, in some cases such as this, the new function may even appear to be intentional!</p>
