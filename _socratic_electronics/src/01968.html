<p>Use circuit simulation software to verify your predicted and measured parameter values.</p>
<p>Use a dual-voltage, regulated power supply to supply power to the opamp.</p>
<p>I have had good success using the following values:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> +V = +12 volts</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> -V = -12 volts</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>T</em><em>P</em>1</sub></span> = Any voltage well between +V and -V</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>p</em><em>o</em><em>t</em></sub></span> = 10 k<span class="math">Ω </span> linear potentiometer</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math"><em>U</em><sub>1</sub></span> = TL081 BiFET operational amplifier (or one-half of a TL082)</p>
<p>In order to demonstrate latch-up, you must have an op-amp capable of latching up. Thus, you should avoid op-amps such as the LM741 and LM1458. I recommend using an op-amp such as the TL082 for this exercise because it not only latches up, but also does not swing its output voltage rail-to-rail. Students need to see both these common limitations when they first learn how to use op-amps.</p>
<p>In case your students ask, test point <strong>TP1</strong> is for measuring the output of the potentiometer rather than as a place to inject external signals into. All you need to connect to <strong>TP1</strong> is a voltmeter!</p>
<p>An extension of this exercise is to incorporate troubleshooting questions. Whether using this exercise as a performance assessment or simply as a concept-building lab, you might want to follow up your students’ results by asking them to predict the consequences of certain circuit faults.</p>
