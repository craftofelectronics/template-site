<p>Explain what the <em>Barkhausen criterion</em> is for an oscillator circuit. How will the oscillator circuit’s performance be affected if the Barkhausen criterion falls below 1, or goes much above 1?</p>
<p>I’ll let you determine exactly what the &quot;Barkhausen&quot; criterion is. If its value is less than 1, the oscillator’s output will diminish in amplitude over time. If its value is greater than 1, the oscillator’s output will not be sinusoidal!</p>
<p>The question of &quot;What is the Barkhausen criterion&quot; could be answered with a short sentence, memorized verbatim from a textbook. But what I’m looking for here is real comprehension of the subject. Have your students explain to you the reason why oscillation amplitude depends on this factor.</p>
