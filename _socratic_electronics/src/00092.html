<p>What is <em>negative resistance</em>?</p>
<p>&quot;Negative resistance&quot; is where an electrical component passes <em>less</em> current as the voltage dropped across it <em>increases</em>.</p>
<p>Not only do many gas-discharge devices exhibit negative resistance over certain portions of their operating range, but many semiconductor devices do as well.</p>
