<p>Compared to common-collector and common-emitter amplifiers, <em>common-base</em> circuits have few practical applications. Explain why.</p>
<p>Common-base amplifier circuits are typified by sub-unity current gains and very low input impedances.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most frequent application of the common-base amplifier topology is the so-called <em>cascode</em> amplifier circuit, where a common-emitter stage acts as a &quot;front-end&quot; buffer to the common-base stage to provide reasonable input impedance and current gain. The grounded-base configuration of the final output stage virtually eliminates the undesirable effects of Miller (collector-to-base) capacitance, resulting in an amplifier capable of high-frequency operation with little or no neutralization required.</p>
