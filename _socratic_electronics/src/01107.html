<p>While simple &quot;brute-force&quot; AC-DC power supply circuits (transformer, rectifier, filter, regulator) are still used in a variety of electronic equipment, another form of power supply is more prevalent in systems where small size and efficiency are design requirements. This type of power supply is called a <em>switching power supply</em>.</p>
<p>Explain what a &quot;switching power supply&quot; is, and provide a schematic diagram of one for presentation and discussion. (Hint: most electronic computers use &quot;switching&quot; power supplies instead of &quot;brute force&quot; power supplies, so schematic diagrams should not be difficult to find.)</p>
<p>Iâ€™ll let you do all the research for this question!</p>
<p>While many &quot;switching&quot; power supply circuits will be too complex for beginning electronics students to fully understand, it will still be a useful exercise to analyze such a schematic and identify the major components (and functions).</p>
<p>Ask your students why &quot;switching&quot; power supplies are smaller and more efficient than &quot;brute force&quot; designs. Ask your students to note the type of transformer used in switching power supplies, and contrast its construction to that of line-frequency power transformers.</p>
