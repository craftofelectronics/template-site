<p>Use the &quot;impedance triangle&quot; to calculate the impedance of this series combination of resistance (<span class="math"><em>R</em></span>) and inductive reactance (<span class="math"><em>X</em></span>):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02081x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Explain what equation(s) you use to calculate <span class="math"><em>Z</em></span>.</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>Z</em></span> = 625 <span class="math">Ω </span>, as calculated by the Pythagorean Theorem.</p>
<p>Be sure to have students show you the form of the Pythagorean Theorem, rather than showing them yourself, since it is so easy for students to research on their own.</p>
