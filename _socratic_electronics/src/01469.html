<p>Suppose we wished to use a shift register circuit to input several binary bits at once (<em>parallel</em> data transfer), and then output the bits one at a time over a single line (<em>serial</em> data transfer). You should be aware of how shift registers are constructed with D-type flip-flops. Now, describe how we can get parallel data entered into a shift register circuit. Note: there is more than one answer to this question!</p>
<p>Perhaps the most direct way to provide parallel data entry is to make use of the flip-flops’ asynchronous inputs.</p>
<p>During discussion, have your students draw a picture of a parallel-in/serial-out shift register circuit, or at least cite a page number reference in their textbook, so you may be sure they understand what they’re talking about (and not just repeating the given answer).</p>
