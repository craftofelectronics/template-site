<p>Use circuit simulation software to verify your predicted and measured parameter values.</p>
<p>I recommend a 47 k<span class="math">Ω </span> resistor for <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> and a 100 k<span class="math">Ω </span> potentiometer for <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>l</em><em>o</em><em>a</em><em>d</em></sub></span>.</p>
<p>An extension of this exercise is to incorporate troubleshooting questions. Whether using this exercise as a performance assessment or simply as a concept-building lab, you might want to follow up your students’ results by asking them to predict the consequences of certain circuit faults.</p>
