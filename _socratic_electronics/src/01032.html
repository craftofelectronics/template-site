<p>Describe the function of a <em>phototransistor</em>. What typical applications do phototransistors have in circuits? What is the schematic symbol for a phototransistor, and how is it properly biased?</p>
<p>Phototransistors are used as light sensors, and also as electrically isolated switching elements when illuminated by LEDs.</p>

<p>Ask your students what point there would be in illuminating a phototransistor with an LED. Why not just dispense with the LED and just use a normal transistor to allow one electrical signal to control another?</p>
