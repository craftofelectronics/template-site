<p>There are two well-known formulae for calculating the total resistance of parallel-connected resistances. One of these works only for two resistances, while the other works for any number of parallel resistances. Write these two formulae, and give examples of their use.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$R_{parallel} = {{R_1 R_2} \over {R_1 + R_2}}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$R_{parallel} = {1 \over { {1 \over R_1} + {1 \over R_2} + \cdots {1 \over R_n} } }$</span><br /></p>
<p>Although I typically use the lower formula exclusively in my teaching, the upper formula is often useful for situations where a calculator is not handy, and you must estimate parallel resistance.</p>
