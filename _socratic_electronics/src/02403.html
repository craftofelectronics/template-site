<p>How would you explain the necessary conditions for conduction of an electric current through a BJT? Describe must be done to a BJT in order for it to conduct a current.</p>
<p>The base-emitter PN junction must be forward-biased, and the polarity of voltage between collector and emitter must be such that the collector current adds with the base current to equal the emitter current.</p>
<p>This is perhaps the most important question your students could learn to answer when first studying BJTs. What, exactly, is necessary to turn one on? Have your students draw diagrams to illustrate their answers as they present in front of the class.</p>
