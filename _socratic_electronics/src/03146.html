<p>An electric motor is used to power a large conveyor belt. Before the motor actually starts, a warning siren activates to alert workers of the conveyor’s forthcoming action. The following relay circuit accomplishes both tasks (motor control plus siren alert):</p>

<p>Study this ladder logic diagram, then explain how the system works.</p>
<p>This is an exercise for you and your classmates to analyze!</p>
<p>This circuit provides students an opportunity to analyze the workings of a delayed-start motor control circuit, where some other action (a siren in this case) takes place during the motor’s delay. Have your students present both their analyses and the methods behind the analyses as you work through this question with them.</p>
