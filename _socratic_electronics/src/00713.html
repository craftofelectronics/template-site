<p>Shockleyâ€™s diode equation in standard form is quite lengthy, but it may be considerably simplified for conditions of room temperature. Note that if the temperature (<span class="math"><em>T</em></span>) is assumed to be room temperature (25<span class="math">$^{o}$</span> C), there are three constants in the equation that are the same for all PN junctions: <span class="math"><em>T</em></span>, <span class="math"><em>k</em></span>, and <span class="math"><em>q</em></span>.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$I_D = I_S (e^{qV_D \over NkT} - 1)$</span><br /></p>
<p>The quantity <span class="math">$kT \over q$</span> is known as the <em>thermal voltage</em> of the junction. Calculate the value of this thermal voltage, given a room temperature of 25<span class="math">$^{o}$</span> C. Then, substitute this quantity into the original &quot;diode formula&quot; so as to simplify its appearance.</p>
<p>If you obtained an answer of 2.16 mV for the &quot;thermal voltage,&quot; you have the temperature figure in the wrong units!</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$I_D = I_S (e^{V_D \over {0.0257 N}} - 1)$</span><br /></p>
<p>Of course, students will have to research the difference between degrees Kelvin and degrees Celsius to successfully calculate the thermal voltage for the junction. They will also have to figure out how to substitute this figure in place of <span class="math"><em>q</em></span>, <span class="math"><em>k</em></span>, and <span class="math"><em>T</em></span> in the original equation. The latter step will be difficult for students not strong in algebra skills.</p>
<p>For those students, I would suggest posing the following question to get them thinking properly about algebraic substitution. Suppose we had the formula <span class="math">$y = x^{ab \over cd}$</span>, and we knew that <span class="math">$b \over c$</span> could be written as <span class="math"><em>m</em></span>. How would we substitute <span class="math"><em>m</em></span> into the original equation? Answer: <span class="math">$y = x^{am \over d}$</span>.</p>
