<p>Suppose you were installing a high-power stereo system in your car, and you wanted to build a simple filter for the &quot;tweeter&quot; (high-frequency) speakers so that no bass (low-frequency) power is wasted in these speakers. Modify the schematic diagram below with a filter circuit of your choice:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00613x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Hint: this only requires a single component per tweeter!</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00613x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Follow-up question: what type of capacitor would you recommend using in this application (electrolytic, mylar, ceramic, etc.)? Why?</p>
<p>Ask your students to describe what type of filter circuit a series-connected capacitor forms: low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, or band-stop? Discuss how the name of this filter should describe its intended function in the sound system.</p>
<p>Regarding the follow-up question, it is important for students to recognize the practical limitations of certain capacitor types. One thing is for sure, ordinary (polarized) electrolytic capacitors will not function properly in an application like this!</p>
