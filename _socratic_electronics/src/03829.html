<p>Identify at least three independent faults that could cause this motor not to start:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03829x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>For each of the proposed faults, explain <em>why</em> they would prevent the motor from starting.</p>
<p>Here are some possible faults (not an exhaustive list by any means!):</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Any fuse blown</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Contactor coil failed open</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Any transformer winding failed open</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Broken jumper between H3 and H2 on the transformer</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Corroded wire connection at terminal A1 or A2</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Motor winding failed shorted</p>
<p>Follow-up question: there will be a difference in operation between the L1 fuse blowing and either the L2 or L3 fuse blowing. Explain what this difference is, and why it might serve as a clue to what was wrong.</p>
<p>Identifying multiple faults should be quite easy in this circuit. The real value of this question is the opportunity for explanation and discussion that it generates for your students as they share their answers with each other.</p>
