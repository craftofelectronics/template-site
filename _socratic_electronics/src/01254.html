<p>The simplest type of digital logic circuit is an <em>inverter</em>, also called an <em>inverting buffer</em>, or <em>NOT gate</em>. Here is a schematic diagram for an inverter gate constructed from complementary MOSFETs (CMOS), shown connected to a SPDT switch and an LED:</p>

<p>Determine the status of the LED in each of the input switchâ€™s two positions. Denote the logic level of switch and LED in the form of a truth table:</p>

<p>Have your students explain the operation of this very simple MOSFET circuit, describing how the inverse logic state is generated at the output terminal, from a given input state. Discuss with your students the simplicity of the CMOS inverter, especially contrasted against a TTL inverter circuit.</p>
