<p>What is the best-performing secondary cell technology today, in terms of energy stored per unit mass?</p>
<p>There is no point in giving an answer here, as it will change as battery technology evolves. However, in your answer you need to specify an actual numerical figure for energy density, for comparison against other classmatesâ€™ research!</p>
<p>Questions like this are fun, because they allow the students to do research on state-of-the-art technology. Ask them where they obtained their information for the answer!</p>
