<p>How does Faraday’s Law of electromagnetic induction relate to the voltage output of a DC generator? According to Faraday’s Law, what factors can we alter to increase the voltage output by a DC generator?</p>
<p>Increase the <span class="math">${d\phi \over dt}$</span> rate of change, or increase the number of turns in the armature winding.</p>
<p>Ask your students to write the equation for Faraday’s Law on the whiteboard, and then analyze it in a qualitative sense (with variables increasing or decreasing in value) to validate the answers.</p>
<p>The first answer to this question (increase <span class="math">${d\phi \over dt}$</span>) has been left purposefully vague, in order to make students think. What, specifically, must be changed in order to increase this rate-of-change over time? Which real-world variables are changeable after the generator has been manufactured, and which are not?</p>
