<p>Using Ohm’s Law, explain why personal protective equipment such as insulating gloves and boots help reduce the risk of electric shock.</p>
<p>Such personal protective equipment serves the purpose of increasing electrical resistance in the shock path.</p>
<p>Ohm’s Law has many applications, and electrical safety is just one of them. I have found that the topic of safety is an excellent venue for highlighting certain (otherwise abstract) physical principles. Not only is the topic interesting, but it is of great personal importance, and so student attention is very easy to attain and hold in discussion.</p>
