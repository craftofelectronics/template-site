<p>Although &quot;across-the-line&quot; motor control circuits are simple and inexpensive, they are not preferred for starting large motors. An alternative to across-the-line motor starting is <em>reduced voltage</em> starting. Identify some of the reasons across-the-line starting is undesirable for large electric motors.</p>
<p>Iâ€™ll let you research the answers to this question!</p>
<p>The reasons for using reduced-voltage starting instead of across-the-line starting go beyond electrical! Discuss this with your students.</p>
