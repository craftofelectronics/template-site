<p>Write a mathematical expression in the form of <span class="math"><em>y</em> = …<em>x</em></span> describing the function of this circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00999x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math"><em>y</em> = 2<em>x</em></span></p>
<p>Your students should be able to recognize that this amplifier circuit has a voltage gain of 2, but expressing it in the form of an equation using variables such as <span class="math"><em>x</em></span> and <span class="math"><em>y</em></span> may be something very new to them. Discuss with your students the significance of this notation: that a <em>circuit</em> may embody an <em>equation</em>. Analog computers may be &quot;obsolete&quot; technology, but they still have many practical applications.</p>
