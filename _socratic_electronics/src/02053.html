<p>The dark shaded area drawn in this cross-section of a PN junction represents the <em>depletion region</em>:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02053x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Re-draw the depletion region when the PN junction is subjected to a reverse-bias voltage:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02053x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02053x03.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Follow-up questions: describe the conductivity of the depletion region: is it high or low? What exactly does the word &quot;depletion&quot; refer to, anyway?</p>
<p>This question makes a good lead-in to a discussion of JFET operation, where the channel conductivity is modulated by the width of the gate-channel depletion region.</p>
