<p>Calculate the reluctance (<span class="math">ℜ</span>) for a magnetic circuit where the MMF (<span class="math">$\cal F$</span>) is 8.9 amp-turns and the flux (<span class="math">Φ </span>) is 0.24 webers.</p>
<p><span class="math">ℜ</span> = 37.08 amp-turns per weber (At/Wb)</p>
<p>Nothing special here, just a simple calculation. One of the points of this question is to have students research Rowland’s Law and learn how to use it as they would Ohm’s Law.</p>
