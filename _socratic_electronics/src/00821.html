<p>How fast must a 12-pole alternator spin in order to produce 60 Hz AC power? Write a mathematical equation solving for speed (<span class="math"><em>S</em></span>) in terms of frequency (<span class="math"><em>f</em></span>) and the number of poles (<span class="math"><em>N</em></span>).</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>S</em> = </span> 600 RPM, for <span class="math"><em>f</em> = </span> 60 Hz.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$S = {{120 f} \over N}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Follow-up question: algebraically manipulate this equation to solve for the number of poles (<span class="math"><em>N</em></span>) needed in a generator given speed (<span class="math"><em>S</em></span>) and frequency (<span class="math"><em>f</em></span>).</p>
<p>This may be especially confusing to some students, until they realize that alternator poles are always multiples of 2 (the simplest alternator having 2 poles).</p>
