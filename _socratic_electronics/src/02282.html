<p>A crystal goblet may be shattered if exposed to high-intensity sound. Less volume is required to shatter the goblet if the sound is at such a frequency that it <em>resonates</em> with the goblet’s natural frequency. That is, there will be maximum transfer of energy to the goblet if the sound waves are transmitted at precisely the goblet’s resonant frequency.</p>
<p>How does this phenomenon relate to the reception of radio waves, since we know that a radio antenna effectively acts as a resonant LC (inductance/capacitance) network?</p>
<p>A radio antenna will receive electromagnetic energy most efficiently if it is sized (tuned) to the exact frequency of the desired radio waves.</p>
<p>The analogy of a goblet shattered by sound waves helps students readily identify with a concept that is otherwise abstract: the reception of <em>electromagnetic</em> waves by an antenna. Ask your students to relate the matching of frequencies to the transmission of radio waves as well as the reception of them.</p>
