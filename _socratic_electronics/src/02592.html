<p>Some operational amplifiers come equipped with compensation capacitors built inside. The classic 741 design is one such opamp:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02592x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Find the compensation capacitor in this schematic diagram, and identify how it provides frequency-dependent negative feedback within the opamp to reduce gain at high frequencies.</p>
<p>Identifying the capacitor is easy: it is the only one in the whole circuit! It couples signal from the collector of <span class="math"><em>Q</em><sub>17</sub></span>, which is an active-loaded common-emitter amplifier, to the base of <span class="math"><em>Q</em><sub>16</sub></span>, which is an emitter-follower driving <span class="math"><em>Q</em><sub>17</sub></span>. Since <span class="math"><em>Q</em><sub>17</sub></span> inverts the signal applied to <span class="math"><em>Q</em><sub>16</sub></span>â€™s base, the feedback is degenerative.</p>
<p>Answering this question will require a review of basic transistor amplifier theory, specifically different configurations of transistor amplifiers and their respective signal phase relationships.</p>
