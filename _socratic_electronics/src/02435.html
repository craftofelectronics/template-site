<p>Determine the approximate amount of collector current for this transistor circuit, given the following characteristic curve set for the transistor:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02435x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02435x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math"><em>I</em><sub><em>C</em></sub> ≈ </span> 4.75 mA</p>
<p>Follow-up question: how much will the collector current rise if the voltage source increases to 35 volts?</p>
<p>This question is nothing more than an exercise in interpreting characteristic curves.</p>
