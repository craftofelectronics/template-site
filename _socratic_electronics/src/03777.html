<p>Predict how the operation of this current regulator circuit will be affected as a result of the following faults. Consider each fault independently (i.e. one at a time, no multiple faults):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03777x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> fails open:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Zener diode <span class="math"><em>D</em><sub>1</sub></span> fails shorted:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span> fails open:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Zener diode <span class="math"><em>D</em><sub>1</sub></span> fails open:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Load fails shorted:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Wire between opamp output and transistor base breaks open:</p>
<p>For each of these conditions, explain <em>why</em> the resulting effects will occur.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> fails open: <em>Load current falls to zero.</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Zener diode <span class="math"><em>D</em><sub>1</sub></span> fails shorted: <em>Load current falls to zero.</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span> fails open: <em>Load current falls to zero.</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Zener diode <span class="math"><em>D</em><sub>1</sub></span> fails open: <em>Load current increases.</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Load fails shorted: <em>Load current remains the same.</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Wire between opamp output and transistor base breaks open: <em>Load current falls to zero.</em></p>
<p>Follow-up question: which of the two opamp power terminals (<span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>s</em><em>u</em><em>p</em><em>p</em><em>l</em><em>y</em></sub></span> or Ground) carries more current during normal operation, and why?</p>
<p>The purpose of this question is to approach the domain of circuit troubleshooting from a perspective of knowing what the fault is, rather than only knowing what the symptoms are. Although this is not necessarily a realistic perspective, it helps students build the foundational knowledge necessary to diagnose a faulted circuit from empirical data. Questions such as this should be followed (eventually) by other questions asking students to identify likely faults based on measurements.</p>
