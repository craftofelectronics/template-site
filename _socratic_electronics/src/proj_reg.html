<hr />
<p>Your project is to design and build a DC voltage regulator capable of regulating 24 volts DC (input) to an adjustable output with a range of <em>at least</em> 3 to 20 volts, with a maximum continuous current rating of 2 amps. Your circuit must be built entirely from discrete components (no integrated circuits), and regulate voltage to within 10%, from no load to full load. Your team is responsible for selecting and testing the circuit design.</p>
<p>A circuit such as this would typically follow an AC-DC power supply (transformer, rectifier, and filter).</p>
