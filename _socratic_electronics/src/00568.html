<p>A potential cause of arc flash, and perhaps even arc blast, is <em>improper</em> meter use. Describe how an ammeter could be mis-applied to a live circuit in such a way that it causes an arc flash or arc blast.</p>
<p>Never, never connect an ammeter across two points in a circuit with substantial voltage between them!</p>
<p>Discuss with your students why an ammeter should never be connected across a voltage source, <em>especially</em> a voltage source in an electrical power system. Relate this to the ideal input resistance of ammeters, and to Ohmâ€™s Law.</p>
