<p>Explain what the purpose of a <em>digital-to-analog converter</em>, or <em>DAC</em> circuit is, in your own words.</p>
<p>The most basic definition for this device should be obvious: a circuit that takes a digital input and creates an analog output. What Iâ€™m looking for, though, is something a little less obvious. In your own words, explain what it means for a circuit to have a &quot;digital input&quot; and an &quot;analog output.&quot; You may give an example of such a circuit if you find it easier to answer the question in context.</p>
<p>Informational sources abound which your students can research. Be sure to ask them to answer specifically, explaining what it means for a circuit to have a &quot;digital input&quot; and an &quot;analog output.&quot;</p>
