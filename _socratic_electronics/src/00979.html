<p>A parasitic property of semiconductor PN junctions is <em>capacitance</em> across the depletion regions. This is often referred to as the <em>Miller Effect</em>. In transistor circuits, the Miller effect contributes to a decrease in voltage gain as signal frequency increases.</p>
<p>Explain why junction capacitances make the voltage gain of an amplifier decrease with increasing frequency.</p>
<p>The Miller capacitance between collector and base in a transistor forms a <em>negative feedback loop</em> for AC signals.</p>
<p>Challenge question: is there any way you can think of to cancel out this negative feedback in an amplifier circuit?</p>
<p>Ask your students to explain what a &quot;negative feedback loop&quot; is, and how exactly the base-collector junction capacitance forms one in a transistor circuit. Also, review the formula for capacitive reactance (<span class="math"><em>X</em><sub><em>C</em></sub></span>), and ask your students to relate this frequency dependence to the degree of negative feedback established in an amplifier circuit.</p>
<p>The challenge question may be answered with a little research into the Miller-effect. There is a method for cancellation of this unwanted negative feedback loop, but it may not be possible to implement in all amplifier circuit topologies.</p>
