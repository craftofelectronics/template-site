<p>Suppose you need a memory array with 4k <span class="math"> × </span> 4 organization, but all you have on hand are 1k <span class="math"> × </span> 4 memory chips. Explain how you could build a memory array of this size using multiple 1k <span class="math"> × </span> 4 chips.</p>
<p>Use four memory chips: parallel the ten address lines from each 1k <span class="math"> × </span> 4 memory chip, then connect the <span class="math">$\overline{CS}$</span> line of each chip to the output of a 2-line to 4-line decoder. The two decoder input lines will then become address lines <span class="math"><em>A</em><sub>10</sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>A</em><sub>11</sub></span> of the 4k <span class="math"> × </span> 4 memory array.</p>
<p>Although no schematic is given here in the answer, I expect my students to be able to draw one on their own.</p>
