<p>Suppose you were given two components and told one was an inductor while the other was a capacitor. Both components are unmarked, and impossible to visually distinguish or identify. Explain how you could use an ohmmeter to distinguish one from the other, based on each componentâ€™s response to direct current (DC).</p>
<p>Then, explain how you could approximately measure the value of each component using nothing more than a sine-wave signal generator and an AC meter capable only of precise AC voltage and current measurements across a wide frequency range (no direct capacitance or inductance measurement capability), and show how the reactance equation for each component (L and C) would be used in your calculations.</p>
<p>Did you really think I would give you the answers to a question like this?</p>
<p>Challenge question: suppose the only test equipment you had available was a 6-volt battery and an old analog volt-milliammeter (with no resistance check function). How could you use this primitive gear to identify which component was the inductor and which was the capacitor?</p>
<p>This is an excellent opportunity to brainstorm as a group and experiment on real components. The purpose of this question is to make the reactance equations more &quot;real&quot; to students by having them apply the equations to a realistic scenario. The ohmmeter test is based on DC component response, which may be thought of in terms of reactance at a frequency at or near zero. The multimeter/generator test is based on AC response, and will require algebraic manipulation to convert the canonical forms of these equations to versions appropriate for calculating L and C.</p>
