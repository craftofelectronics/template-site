<p>The following is an internal schematic of a TTL logic gate. Based on your analysis of the transistor circuit, determine what type of gate (AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR, etc.) it is:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01250x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Hint: the double-emitter transistor is being used as a pair of diodes, and not as an amplifying device!</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01250x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>This is a NAND gate circuit.</p>
<p>TTL circuits are actually quite easy to analyze compared to analog amplifier circuits! Discuss with your students the use of a dual-emitter transistor as a &quot;steering&quot; diode network: this is a trick used by IC manufacturers, to obtain three diodes for the &quot;price&quot; of one transistor.</p>
