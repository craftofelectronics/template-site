<p>Graph both the capacitor voltage (<span class="math"><em>E</em><sub><em>C</em></sub></span>) and the capacitor current (<span class="math"><em>I</em><sub><em>C</em></sub></span>) over time as the switch is closed in this circuit. Assume the capacitor begins in a complete uncharged state (0 volts):</p>
