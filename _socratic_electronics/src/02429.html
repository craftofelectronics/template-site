<p>A technician is troubleshooting a faulty optically-isolated TRIAC power switching circuit. The solenoid valve is supposed to open up and pass liquid through it whenever the pushbutton switch is pressed, but it remains shut no matter what state the switch is in:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02429x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Holding the switch in the &quot;pressed&quot; position with a piece of tape, the technician measures 0 volts AC between test points TP4 and TP5, and 9 volts DC (normal for the battery) between test points TP1 and TP3. Based on these voltage measurements, identify two possible faults that could account for the problem and all measured values in this circuit, and also identify two circuit elements that could not possibly be to blame (i.e. two things that you know <em>must</em> be functioning properly, no matter what else may be faulted). The circuit elements you identify as either possibly faulted or properly functioning can be wires, traces, and connections as well as components. Be as specific as you can in your answers, identifying both the circuit element and the type of fault.</p>
