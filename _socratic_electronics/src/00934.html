<p>Shown here is a simple circuit for constructing an extremely high input impedance voltmeter on a wireless breadboard, using one half of a TL082 dual op-amp:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00934x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Draw a schematic diagram of this circuit, a calculate the resistor value necessary to give the meter a voltage measurement range of 0 to 5 volts.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00934x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math"><em>R</em> = </span> 5 k<span class="math">Ω </span></p>
<p>Follow-up question: determine the approximate input impedance of this voltmeter, and also the maximum voltage it is able to measure with <em>any</em> size resistor in the circuit.</p>
<p>This is a very practical circuit for your students to build, and they may find it outperforms their own (purchased) voltmeters in the parameter of input impedance! Be sure to ask them where they found the information on input impedance for the TL082 op-amp, and how they were able to determine the maximum input voltage for a circuit like this.</p>
