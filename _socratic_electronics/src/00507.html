<p>An electronics instructor wants to demonstrate to his students the effect of electrical resistance changing with temperature. To do this, he selects a carbon resistor about 3 centimeters in length and 5 millimeters in diameter, black in color, with a wire at each end, and connects it to an ohmmeter. Whenever he grasps the resistor between his fingers, the ohmmeter instantly responds by showing a greatly reduced resistance.</p>
<p>What is wrong with this experiment?</p>
<p>If the change in resistance is truly due to a change in resistor temperature, it should not be <em>instant</em>.</p>
<p>I must confess, the genesis of this question was an experience from my own education. This really happened! I still remember staring at the demonstration, perplexed that the resistance would change so quickly and so greatly when the instructor grasped the resistor. I also recall the mild insult the instructor directed at me as I attempted to communicate my confusion: &quot;What’s the matter? Too complicated for you?&quot; Please, never treat your students like this.</p>
<p>Some students may believe the experiment is flawed because they expect the resistance to rise with increased temperature, rather than fall. This, however, makes a fundamental assumption about the nature of temperature-induced resistance changes, which is a bad thing in science. Let the experimental evidence tell you how the phenomenon works, don’t tell it what it should do!</p>
<p>Discuss with your students what they think the <em>real</em> mechanism of resistance change is in this experiment, and how they might modify the experiment so as to isolate temperature as the only changing variable.</p>
