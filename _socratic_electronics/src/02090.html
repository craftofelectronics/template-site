<p>A parallel RC circuit has 10 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>S of susceptance (<span class="math"><em>B</em></span>). How much conductance (<span class="math"><em>G</em></span>) is necessary to give the circuit a (total) phase angle of 22 degrees?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02090x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math"><em>G</em></span> = 24.75 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>S</p>
<p>Follow-up question: how much resistance is this, in ohms?</p>
<p>Ask your students to explain their method(s) of solution, including any ways to double-check the correctness of the answer.</p>
