<p>A very popular active filter topology is called the <em>Sallen-Key</em>. Two examples of Sallen-Key active filter circuits are shown here:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00765x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00765x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Determine which of these Sallen-Key filters is low pass, and which is high pass. Explain your answers.</p>
<p>The first filter shown is low pass, while the second filter shown is high pass.</p>
<p>Challenge question: what is the purpose of resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>3</sub></span> in each circuit?</p>
<p>The word &quot;topology&quot; may be strange to your students. If any of them ask you what it means, ask them if they own a dictionary!</p>
<p>Like all the other active filter circuits, the fundamental characteristic of each filter may be determined by qualitative analysis at <span class="math"><em>f</em> = 0</span> and <span class="math"><em>f</em> = ∞</span>. This is a form of <em>thought experiment</em>: determining the characteristics of a circuit by imagining the effects of certain given conditions, following through by analysis based on &quot;first principles&quot; of circuits, rather than by researching what the circuit’s intended function is.</p>
<p>Resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>3</sub></span> is actually not essential to the circuit’s operation, but is normally found in Sallen-Key filters anyway. If it makes the analysis of the circuit any simpler, tell your students they may replace that resistor with a straight wire in their schematic diagrams.</p>
