<p>This voltage divider circuit has a problem: there is no voltage output between terminals 7 and 8.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03586x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>A technician has taken several measurements with a voltmeter, documenting them chronologically from top to bottom in the far-left column:</p>
<p><span class="math"></span><span class="math"></span> Fill in all cells of this table with one of three different symbols, representing the status of each component or wire (numbers separated by a slash indicate the wire connecting those terminals):</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <strong>O</strong> for an &quot;open&quot; fault</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <strong>S</strong> for an &quot;short&quot; fault</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <strong>OK</strong> for no fault</p>
<p>You are to assume that there is only one fault in this circuit, and that it is either a complete break (open) or a direct short (zero resistance). After completing the table, assess whether or not the exact fault may be known from the data recorded thus far. If not, suggest the next logical voltage measurement to take.</p>
<p><span class="math"></span><span class="math"></span> We do not yet have enough information to determine whether resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>3</sub></span> or wire 6/7 is failed open. A good voltage measurement to take now would be across the resistor (terminals 5 and 6), or between terminals 6 and 7.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: describe how much voltage you would expect to find between either of these terminal pairs, given an open fault with either suspected component.</p>
<p>Ask your students to defend their answers for each component status, for each of the successive measurements. What you will find is that this forces students to rigorously analyze the possibilities of a fault in each portion of the circuit. Not only is this beneficial for reinforcing basic circuit principles, but it also teaches students to consider all possibilities when troubleshooting a circuit.</p>
