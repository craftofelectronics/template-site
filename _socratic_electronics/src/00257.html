<p>Write the equation relating electric current and magnetic field strength together in a wire coil. If the current (<span class="math"><em>I</em></span>) is given in units of amperes, and the number of turns is a simple integer value, what unit of measurement will the magnetic field strength have?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">${\cal F} = IN$</span><br /></p>
<p>Where,</p>
<p><span class="math">${\cal F} =$</span> Magnetomotive force (magnetic field strength), in amp-turns</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>I</em> = </span> Current in wire coil, amps</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>N</em> = </span> Number of turns in coil</p>
<p>Sometimes, units of measurement make perfect sense! In this case, the unit of the amp-turn follows obviously from the construction of the equation, with amps times turns.</p>
