<p>Using a <em>commutating diode</em> (sometimes called a <em>free-wheeling diode</em>) to eliminate switch contact arcing for inductive loads in a DC circuit works well, but it has an unfortunate side-effect:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00982x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>With a diode in place, the release time for the solenoid increases measurably. In other words, it takes longer for the solenoid to completely de-magnetize after the switch contacts open, than if there is no diode in the circuit.</p>
<p>Explain why this is, and also propose a solution for the minimizing the solenoid’s release time.</p>
<p>The presence of a commutating diode increases the solenoid’s release time because the L/R time constant of the de-energizing circuit is made much longer than with no diode in place. The solution to this problem is to decrease the L/R time constant of the discharge circuit (I’ll let you figure out how!).</p>
<p>This question is an good review of inductor time constant theory, and challenges students to put their mastery of L/R time constant circuits to the test by engineering a solution for this problem.</p>
<p>Once a solution has been agreed upon, ask your students if the solution introduces (or re-introduces, as the case may be) any other problems in the circuit.</p>
