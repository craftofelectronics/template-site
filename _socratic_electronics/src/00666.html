<p>How much AC voltage is there between points <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong> in this circuit?</p>

<p><span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>A</em><em>B</em></sub> = </span> 397 VAC</p>
<p>In reality, this is nothing more than an exercise in Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law (KVL): determining the voltage between two points in a loop, knowing the voltages between other points in that same loop. Two principal challenges present themselves in this exercise: identifying the loop, and relating the dot convention to polarity markings. Different students will likely have different approaches to this problem, so it should make for an interesting discussion!</p>
