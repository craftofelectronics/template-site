<p>Suppose you needed to choose a fixed resistor value (<span class="math"><em>R</em></span>) to make a voltage divider circuit, given a known potentiometer resistance value, the source voltage value, and the desired range of adjustment:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03102x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Solve for <span class="math"><em>R</em></span>, and show the equation you set up in order to do it.</p>
<p>Hint: remember the series resistor voltage divider formula . . .</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$V_R = V_{total}\left( {R \over R_{total}} \right)$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math"><em>R</em> = </span> 20.588 k<span class="math">Ω </span></p>
<p>Be sure to have your students set up their equations in front of the class so everyone can see how they did it. Some students may opt to apply Ohm’s Law to the solution of <span class="math"><em>R</em></span>, which is good, but for the purpose of developing equations to fit problems it might not be the best solution. Challenge your students to come up with a <em>single equation</em> that solves for <span class="math"><em>R</em></span>, with all known quantities on the other side of the &quot;equal&quot; sign.</p>
