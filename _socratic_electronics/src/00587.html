<p>At what frequency does a 33 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>F capacitor have 20 <span class="math">Ω </span> of reactance? Write the formula for solving this, in addition to calculating the frequency.</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>f</em> = 241. 1</span> Hz</p>
<p>Be sure to ask your students to demonstrate the algebraic manipulation of the original formula, in providing the answer to this question. Algebraic manipulation of equations is a very important skill to have, and it comes only by study and practice.</p>
