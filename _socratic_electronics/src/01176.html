<p>Identify what type of amplifier circuit this is, and also what would happen to the output voltage if <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>i</em><em>n</em>2</sub></span> were to become more positive:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01176x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>This is a <em>differential amplifier</em> circuit. If <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>i</em><em>n</em>2</sub></span> were to become more positive, <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>o</em><em>u</em><em>t</em></sub></span> would become more negative.</p>
<p>Students should be able to relate this circuit to its bipolar transistor counterpart. Ask them to explain what advantages or disadvantages this circuit holds over a bipolar differential amplifier circuit.</p>
