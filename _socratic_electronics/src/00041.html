<p>Suppose someone mechanically couples an electric motor to an electric generator, then electrically couples the two devices together in an effort to make a perpetual-motion machine:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00041x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Why won’t this assembly spin forever, once started?</p>
<p>This will not work because neither the motor nor the generator is 100% efficient.</p>
<p>The easy answer to this question is &quot;the Law of Conservation of Energy (or the Second Law of Thermodynamics) forbids it,&quot; but citing such a &quot;Law&quot; really doesn’t explain <em>why</em> perpetual motion machines are doomed to failure. It is important for students to realize that reality is not <em>bound</em> to the physical &quot;Laws&quot; scientists set; rather, what we call &quot;Laws&quot; are actually just <em>descriptions</em> of regularities seen in nature. It is important to emphasize critical thinking in a question like this, for it is no more intellectually mature to deny the possibility of an event based on dogmatic adherence to a Law than it is to naively believe that anything is possible.</p>
