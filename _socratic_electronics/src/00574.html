<p>What step(s) must be taken after locking and tagging an electrical disconnect device for a circuit to be worked on, and prior to actually proceeding with the work? What step(s) come between the lock-out and the work itself?</p>
<p>Check for the presence of voltage on the conductors of the circuit to be worked on.</p>
<p>There is more to this answer than simply &quot;check for voltage.&quot; Ask your students to explain what types of voltage they need to check for, and how they can ensure their voltmeters are properly functioning, so as not to &quot;miss&quot; detecting a dangerous condition.</p>
