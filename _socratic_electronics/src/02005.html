<p>Draw an energy diagram for a PN semiconductor junction under the influence of a <em>forward</em> external voltage.</p>

<p><em>Note: <span class="math"><em>E</em><sub><em>f</em></sub></span> represents the Fermi energy level, and not a voltage. In physics, <span class="math"><em>E</em></span> always stands for energy and <span class="math"><em>V</em></span> for potential (voltage).</em></p>
<p>Here it is very important that students understand the effects an electric field has on energy bands.</p>
