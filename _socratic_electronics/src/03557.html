<p>The following circuit allows a capacitor to be rapidly discharged and slowly charged:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03557x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Suppose that the switch was left in the &quot;discharge&quot; position for some substantial amount of time. Then, someone moves the switch to the &quot;charge&quot; position to let the capacitor charge. Calculate the amount of capacitor voltage and capacitor current at exactly 45 milliseconds after moving the switch to the &quot;charge&quot; position.</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>C</em></sub></span> = @ <span class="math"><em>t</em></span> = 45 ms</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>I</em><sub><em>C</em></sub></span> = @ <span class="math"><em>t</em></span> = 45 ms</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>C</em></sub></span> = @ <span class="math"><em>t</em></span> = 45 ms</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>I</em><sub><em>C</em></sub></span> = @ <span class="math"><em>t</em></span> = 45 ms</p>
<p>Follow-up question: show the directions of charge and discharge current in this circuit.</p>
<p>Here, students must choose which equation(s) to use for the calculation, calculate the time constant for the circuit, and put all the variables in the right place to obtain the correct answers. Discuss all these steps with your students, allowing them to explain how they approached the question.</p>
<p>If anyone asks, let them know that the capacitor symbol shown represents a polarized (electrolytic) capacitor.</p>
