<p>A passive differentiator is used to &quot;shorten&quot; the pulse width of a square wave by sending the differentiated signal to a &quot;level detector&quot; circuit, which outputs a &quot;high&quot; signal (+5 volts) whenever the input exceeds 3.5 volts and a &quot;low&quot; signal (0 volts) whenever the input drops below 3.5 volts:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03653x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Each time the differentiator’s output voltage signal spikes up to +5 volts and quickly decays to 0 volts, it causes the level detector circuit to output a narrow voltage pulse, which is what we want.</p>
<p>Calculate how wide this final output pulse will be if the input (square wave) frequency is 2.5 kHz.</p>

<p>This question requires students to calculate a length of time in an RC circuit, given specific voltage levels and component values. It is a very practical question, as it may be necessary to build or troubleshoot such a circuit some day!</p>
