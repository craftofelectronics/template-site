<p>How many poles does an alternator have if it generates 400 Hz power at a shaft speed of 6000 RPM?</p>
<p>8 poles, which is the same as 4 pole <em>pairs</em>.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: algebraically manipulate the speed/poles/frequency equation to solve for the frequency generated (<span class="math"><em>f</em></span>) given the number of poles (<span class="math"><em>N</em></span>) and the generator speed (<span class="math"><em>S</em></span>).</p>
<p>Some references provide equations in terms of <em>pole pairs</em> instead of individual alternator poles.</p>
