<p>Shown here are two sine waves of equal frequency, superimposed on the same graph:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00494x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>As accurately as possible, determine the amount of phase shift between the two waves, based on the divisions shown on the graph.</p>
<p>Also, plot a third sine wave that is the <em>sum</em> of the two sine waves shown. Again, do this as accurately as possible, based on the divisions shown on the graph. To give an example of how you might do this, observe the following illustration:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00494x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>What is the peak value of the resultant (sum) sine-wave? How does this compare with the peak values of the two original sine waves?</p>
<p>The two (original) sine waves are 90<span class="math">$^{o}$</span> out of phase, one with a peak value of 4 volts, and the other with a peak value of 3 volts.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00494x03.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Together, they add to make a third sine wave with a peak value of 5 volts.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: how is it possible that the sum of 3 and 4 makes 5? Hint: youâ€™ve probably seen something like this when studying trigonometry!</p>
<p>Though it may seem a laborious exercise at first, the point of this question is for students to realize that the sum of two equal-frequency sine waves is another sine wave. The peak values of 3 and 4, together with the phase-shift of 90<span class="math">$^{o}$</span>, was no coincidence on my part when I wrote this question. Where else in mathematics have students seen an example of the quantities 3 and 4 being combined (at 90 degrees) to make a quantity of 5?</p>
