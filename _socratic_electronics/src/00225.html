<p>Where does the energy come from that causes a battery to be a source of electricity for powering electrical devices? Ultimately, what is the energy <em>source</em> of a battery?</p>
<p>Electrical batteries derive their energy from chemical compounds stored within.</p>
<p>Battery electrochemistry is quite complex, and not easily addressed in a class environment unless all students have a good background knowledge of chemistry. It is not the point of this question to address issues of electrochemistry, but merely to point out the nature of a batteryâ€™s energy source.</p>
