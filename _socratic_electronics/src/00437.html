<p>Generally speaking, how many &quot;time constants&quot; worth of time does it take for the voltage and current to &quot;settle&quot; into their final values in an RC or LR circuit, from the time the switch is closed?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00437x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>If you said, &quot;five time constants’ worth&quot; (<span class="math">5<em>τ</em></span>), you might not be thinking deeply enough! In actuality, the voltage and current in such a circuit <em>never</em> finally reach stable values, because their approach is asymptotic.</p>
<p>However, after 5 time constants’ worth of time, the variables in an RC or LR circuit will have settled to within 0.6% of their final values, which is good enough for most people to call &quot;final.&quot;</p>
<p>The stock answer of &quot;5 time constants&quot; as the amount of time elapsed between the transient event and the &quot;final&quot; settling of voltage and current values is widespread, but largely misunderstood. I’ve encountered more than a few graduates of electronics programs who actually believe there is something special about the number <em>5</em>, as though everything grinds to a halt at exactly 5 time constants worth of time after the switch closes.</p>
<p>In reality, the rule of thumb of &quot;5 time constants&quot; as a settling time in RC and LR circuits is an approximation only. Somewhere I recall reading an old textbook that specified <em>ten</em> time constants as the time required for all the variables to reach their final values. Another old book declared <em>seven</em> time constants. I think we’re getting impatient as the years roll on!</p>
