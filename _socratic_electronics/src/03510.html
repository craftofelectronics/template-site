<p>Controlling electrical &quot;noise&quot; in automotive electrical systems can be problematic, as there are many sources of &quot;noise&quot; voltages throughout a car. Spark ignitions and alternators can both generate substantial noise voltages, superimposed on the DC voltage in a carâ€™s electrical system. A simple way to electrically model this noise is to draw it as an AC &quot;noise voltage&quot; source in series with the DC source. If this noise enters a radio or audio amplifier, the result will be an irritating sound produced at the speakers:</p>

<p>What would you suggest as a &quot;fix&quot; for this problem if a friend asked you to apply your electronics expertise to their noisy car audio system? Be sure to provide at least two practical suggestions.</p>
<p>This is perhaps the easiest solution, to install a very large capacitor (<span class="math"><em>C</em><sub><em>h</em><em>u</em><em>g</em><em>e</em></sub></span>) in parallel with the audio load:</p>

<p>Other, more sophisticated solutions exist, however!</p>
<p>Follow-up question: use superposition theorem to show <em>why</em> the capacitor mitigates the electrical noise without interfering with the transfer of DC power to the radio/amplifier.</p>
<p>The follow-up question is yet another example of how practical the superposition theorem is when analyzing filter circuits.</p>
