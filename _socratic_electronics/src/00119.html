<p>In this circuit, where would you expect to measure full battery voltage (between what pairs of test points)?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00119x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>You should expect to measure full battery voltage with one test lead of your voltmeter touching any of the points along the top wire of the circuit (points A through E), and with the other test lead touching any of the points along the bottom wire of the circuit (points F through J).</p>
<p>This circuit provides an excellent opportunity to discuss the concept of &quot;electrically common&quot; points. Any points in a circuit directly connected together with wire are considered &quot;electrically common&quot; to each other: a voltage measurement referenced at any one of those points should be identical if referenced any of the other points as well.</p>
