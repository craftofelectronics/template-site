<p>Electromechanical watt-hour meters use an aluminum disk that is spun by an electric motor. To generate a constant &quot;drag&quot; on the disk necessary to limit its rotational speed, a strong magnet is placed in such a way that its lines of magnetic flux pass perpendicularly through the disk’s thickness:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00259x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Explain the phenomenon behind this magnetic &quot;drag&quot; mechanism, and also explain how the permanent magnet assembly should be re-positioned so that it provides <em>less</em> drag on the disk for the same rotational speed.</p>
<p>This is an example of <em>Lenz’ Law</em>. For decreased drag on the disk, the magnet needs to be moved over a spot on the disk that has less surface velocity (I’ll let you figure out where that might be).</p>
<p>Follow-up question: suppose you <em>move</em> a strong magnet past the surface of an aluminum disk. What will happen to the disk, if anything?</p>
<p>An important calibration adjustment on electromechanical wattmeter assemblies is the positioning of the &quot;drag&quot; magnet, making this question a very practical one. An interesting challenge for students is to ask them to sketch the flow of induced electric current in the disk as it rotates past the magnet!</p>
<p>The follow-up question is actually a preview of induction motor theory, and may be illustrated with a powerful (rare-earth) magnet and a metal coin (Japanese Yen, made of aluminum, work very well for this, being good electrical conductors and lightweight!).</p>
