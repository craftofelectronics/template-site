<p>Calculate the total amount of current that the battery must supply to this parallel circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01964x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Now, using Ohm’s Law, calculate total resistance (<span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>t</em><em>o</em><em>t</em><em>a</em><em>l</em></sub></span>) from total (source) voltage <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>t</em><em>o</em><em>t</em><em>a</em><em>l</em></sub></span> and total (source) current <span class="math"><em>I</em><sub><em>t</em><em>o</em><em>t</em><em>a</em><em>l</em></sub></span>.</p>
<p><span class="math">$I_{total} = 40.0 \hbox{ mA}$</span></p>
<p><span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>t</em><em>o</em><em>t</em><em>a</em><em>l</em></sub> = 250 Ω </span></p>
<p>Follow-up question: without appealing to Ohm’s Law, explain why the total resistance is one-half as much as either of the individual resistances.</p>
<p>While some students seem able to immediately grasp the concept of parallel resistances diminishing in (total) value, it is worthwhile to approach it from an Ohm’s Law perspective as well to give other students a more formal rationale for this effect.</p>
