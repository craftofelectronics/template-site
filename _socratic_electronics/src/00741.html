<p>An interesting variation on the induction motor theme is the <em>wound-rotor</em> induction motor. In the simplest form of a wound-rotor motor, the rotorâ€™s electromagnet coil terminates on a pair of slip rings which permit contact with stationary carbon brushes, allowing an external circuit to be connected to the rotor coil:</p>

<p>Explain how this motor can be operated as either a synchronous motor or a &quot;plain&quot; induction motor.</p>
<p>A wound-rotor motor with a single rotor coil may be operated as a synchronous motor by energizing the rotor coil with direct current (DC). Induction operation is realized by short-circuiting the slip rings together, through the brush connections.</p>
<p>Challenge question: what will happen to this motor if a <em>resistance</em> is connected between the brushes, instead of a DC source or a short-circuit?</p>
<p>In reality, almost all large synchronous motors are built this way, with an electromagnetic rotor rather than a permanent-magnet rotor. This allows the motor to start much easier. Ask your students why they think this would be an important feature in a large synchronous motor, to be able to start it as an induction motor. What would happen if AC power were suddenly applied to a large synchronous motor with its rotor already magnetized?</p>
<p>If a resistance is connected between the brushes, it allows for an even easier start-up. By &quot;easier,&quot; I mean a start-up that draws less inrush current, resulting in a gentler ramp up to full speed.</p>
