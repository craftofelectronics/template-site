<p>Predict how the operation of this logic gate circuit will be affected as a result of the following faults. Consider each fault independently (i.e. one at a time, no multiple faults):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03832x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Output of AND gate <span class="math"><em>U</em><sub>2</sub></span> fails low:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Output of AND gate <span class="math"><em>U</em><sub>2</sub></span> fails high:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Output of inverter gate <span class="math"><em>U</em><sub>1</sub></span> fails low:</p>
<p>For each of these conditions, explain <em>why</em> the resulting effects will occur.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Output of AND gate <span class="math"><em>U</em><sub>2</sub></span> fails low: <em>Gate <span class="math"><em>U</em><sub>3</sub></span> output stuck in the high state.</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Output of AND gate <span class="math"><em>U</em><sub>2</sub></span> fails high: <em>Gate <span class="math"><em>U</em><sub>3</sub></span> output simply equal to <span class="math">$\overline{C}$</span>, no other inputs have any effect on <span class="math"><em>U</em><sub>3</sub></span>’s output.</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Output of inverter gate <span class="math"><em>U</em><sub>1</sub></span> fails low: <em>Gate <span class="math"><em>U</em><sub>3</sub></span> output stuck in the high state.</em></p>
<p>The purpose of this question is to approach the domain of circuit troubleshooting from a perspective of knowing what the fault is, rather than only knowing what the symptoms are. Although this is not necessarily a realistic perspective, it helps students build the foundational knowledge necessary to diagnose a faulted circuit from empirical data. Questions such as this should be followed (eventually) by other questions asking students to identify likely faults based on measurements.</p>
