<p>In DC circuits, we have Ohm’s Law to relate voltage, current, and resistance together:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math"><em>E</em> = <em>I</em><em>R</em></span><br /></p>
<p>In AC circuits, we similarly need a formula to relate voltage, current, and <em>impedance</em> together. Write three equations, one solving for each of these three variables: a set of Ohm’s Law formulae for AC circuits. Be prepared to show how you may use algebra to manipulate one of these equations into the other two forms.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math"><em>E</em> = <em>I</em><em>Z</em></span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$I = {E \over Z}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$Z = {E \over I}$</span><br /></p>
<p>If using phasor quantities (complex numbers) for voltage, current, and impedance, the proper way to write these equations is as follows:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">${\bf E} = {\bf IZ}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">${\bf I} = {{\bf E} \over {\bf Z}}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">${\bf Z} = {{\bf E} \over {\bf I}}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Bold-faced type is a common way of denoting vector quantities in mathematics.</p>
<p>Although the use of phasor quantities for voltage, current, and impedance in the AC form of Ohm’s Law yields certain distinct advantages over scalar calculations, this does not mean one cannot use scalar quantities. Often it is appropriate to express an AC voltage, current, or impedance as a simple scalar number.</p>
