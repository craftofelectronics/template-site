<p>Use circuit simulation software to verify your predicted and measured parameter values.</p>
<p>Being able to design a circuit using a BJT as a switch is a valuable skill for technicians and engineers alike to have. The circuit shown in this question is not the only possibility, but it is the simplest.</p>
<p>Remind your students that the equation for calculating BJT power dissipation is as follows:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$P_Q = I_C \Bigl(V_{CE} + {V_{BE} \over \beta}\Bigr)$</span><br /></p>
<p>An extension of this exercise is to incorporate troubleshooting questions. Whether using this exercise as a performance assessment or simply as a concept-building lab, you might want to follow up your studentsâ€™ results by asking them to predict the consequences of certain circuit faults.</p>
