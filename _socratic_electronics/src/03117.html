<p>The following two expressions are frequently used to calculate values of changing variables (voltage and current) in RC and LR timing circuits:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$e^{-{t \over \tau}} \hbox{\hskip 30pt or \hskip 30pt} 1 - e^{-{t \over \tau}}$</span><br /></p>
<p>One of these expressions describes the percentage that a changing value in an RC or LR circuit <em>has gone</em> from the starting time. The other expression describes how far that same variable <em>has left to go</em> before it reaches its ultimate value (at <span class="math"><em>t</em> = ∞</span>).</p>
<p>The question is, which expression represents which quantity? This is often a point of confusion, because students have a tendency to try to correlate these expressions to the quantities by rote memorization. Does the expression <span class="math">$e^{-{t \over \tau}}$</span> represent the amount a variable has changed, or how far it has left to go until it stabilizes? What about the other expression <span class="math">$1 - e^{-{t \over \tau}}$</span>? More importantly, <em>how can we figure this out so we don’t have to rely on memory?</em></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03117x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Here is a hint: set <span class="math"><em>x</em></span> to zero and evaluate each equation.</p>
<p>It is very important for students to understand what this expression means and how it works, lest they rely solely on memorization to use it in their calculations. As I always tell my students, rote memorization <em>will</em> fail you! If a student does not comprehend why the expression works as it does, they will be helpless to retain it as an effective &quot;tool&quot; for performing calculations in the future.</p>
