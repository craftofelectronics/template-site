<p>Voltmeters must be connected in <em>parallel</em> with the voltage to be measured:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03639x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>In order to practically function, an voltmeter must have some finite amount of internal resistance. It is usually a very large amount, but less than infinite. It should be apparent to you that the presence of this resistance will have some effect on the circuit voltage, when compared to the amount of voltage in the circuit without any meter connected, due to the fact that real voltage sources tend to “sag” when subjected to additional loads:</p>

<p>Explain why it is usually safe to ignore the internal resistance of an voltmeter, though, when it is in a circuit. A common term used in electrical engineering to describe this intentional oversight is <em>swamping</em>. In this particular circuit an engineer would say, “The resistance of the light bulb <em>swamps</em> the internal resistance of the voltmeter.”</p>
<p>When one quantity “swamps” another, we mean that its effect is huge compared to the effect of the other, so much so that we may safely ignore it in our calculations and still arrive at a reasonably accurate result.</p>
<p>I have found that the concept of “swamping” is extremely useful when making estimations. To be able to ignore the values of some components allows one to simplify a great many circuits, enabling easier calculations to be performed.</p>
