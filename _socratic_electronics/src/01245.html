<p>Draw the Bode plot for an <em>ideal</em> low-pass filter circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01245x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Be sure to note the &quot;cutoff frequency&quot; on your plot.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01245x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Follow-up question: a theoretical filter with this kind of idealized response is sometimes referred to as a &quot;brick wall&quot; filter. Explain why this name is appropriate.</p>
<p>The plot given in the answer, of course, is for an ideal low-pass filter, where all frequencies below <span class="math"><em>f</em><sub><em>c</em><em>u</em><em>t</em><em>o</em><em>f</em><em>f</em></sub></span> are passed and all frequencies above <span class="math"><em>f</em><sub><em>c</em><em>u</em><em>t</em><em>o</em><em>f</em><em>f</em></sub></span> are blocked. In reality, filter circuits never attain this ideal &quot;square-edge&quot; response. Discuss possible applications of such a filter with your students.</p>
<p>Challenge them to draw the Bode plots for ideal <em>band-pass</em> and <em>band-stop</em> filters as well. Exercises such as this really help to clarify the purpose of filter circuits. Otherwise, there is a tendency to lose perspective of what real filter circuits, with their correspondingly complex Bode plots and mathematical analyses, are supposed to do.</p>
