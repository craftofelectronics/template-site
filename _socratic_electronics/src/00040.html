<p>Determine which light bulb(s) will glow brightly, and which light bulb(s) will glow dimly (assuming all light bulbs are identical).</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00040x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Bulbs &quot;A&quot; and &quot;C&quot; will glow brightly, while bulbs &quot;B&quot; and &quot;D&quot; will glow dimly.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: explain why bulbs &quot;A&quot; and &quot;C&quot; will become dimmer (less bright) if the filament in bulb &quot;D&quot; fails open.</p>
<p>This question provides an opportunity to discuss current in series- versus parallel-connected components. The follow-up question challenges students to qualitatively analyze the circuit.</p>
