<p>Observe the following sequence of numbers:</p>
<p>00</p>
<p>01</p>
<p>02</p>
<p>03</p>
<p>04</p>
<p>05</p>
<p>06</p>
<p>07</p>
<p>08</p>
<p>09</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>What pattern(s) do you notice in the digits, as we count upward from 0 to 21 (and beyond)? This may seem like a very simplistic question (and it is!), but it is important to recognize any inherent patterns so that you may understand counting sequences in numeration systems with bases other than ten.</p>
<p>Note the repeating sequence of digits in the one’s place, and the developing pattern of incrementation in the ten’s place. How many numbers may be counted without repeating digits in the one’s place?</p>
<p>Some students will think this question to be ridiculously simple, but there are some important lessons to be learned here. The greatest problem students face while learning binary, octal, and hexadecimal numeration systems is the overpowering familiarity with base-ten numeration. We are <em>so</em> accustomed to base-ten that we don’t bother to recognize its basic properties, and typically believe that this is the only way numbers may be written!</p>
