<p>For a true TTL gate (not high-speed CMOS), what is the default logic state of an input line that is left floating (neither connected to <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>C</em><em>C</em></sub></span> nor Ground)? Explain why this is.</p>
<p>Floating TTL inputs generally assume a &quot;high&quot; state due to the steering diode/resistor network on the input stage of each gate circuit.</p>
<p>The given answer does not provide enough detail to explain <em>why</em> TTL inputs tend to float high, so I recommend you display an internal TTL gate schematic for your students to analyze and comment on in class.</p>
