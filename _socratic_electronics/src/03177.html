<p>Use circuit simulation software to verify your predicted and measured parameter values.</p>
<p>Use a variable-current, regulated power supply to supply any amount of DC current below a few milliamps. Students will have to choose resistor values appropriate to the task. I recommend low-value resistors so as to keep the voltage drop (and power dissipation!) low.</p>
<p>An extension of this exercise is to incorporate troubleshooting questions. Whether using this exercise as a performance assessment or simply as a concept-building lab, you might want to follow up your studentsâ€™ results by asking them to predict the consequences of certain circuit faults.</p>
