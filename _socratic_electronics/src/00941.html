<p>If a transistor is subjected to several different base currents, and the collector-emitter voltage (<span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>C</em><em>E</em></sub></span>) &quot;swept&quot; through the full range for each of these base current values, data for an entire &quot;family&quot; of characteristic curves may be obtained and graphed:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00941x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>What do these characteristic curves indicate about the base currentâ€™s control over collector current? How are the two currents related?</p>
<p>The collector current is (for the most part) directly proportional to base current while in the &quot;active&quot; region.</p>
<p>Ask your students what the characteristic curves would look like for a <em>perfect</em> transistor: one that was a perfect regulator of collector current over the full range of collector-emitter voltage.</p>
