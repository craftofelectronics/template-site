<p>Predict how the operation of this logic gate circuit will be affected as a result of the following faults. Consider each fault independently (i.e. one at a time, no multiple faults):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03822x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Diode <span class="math"><em>D</em><sub>1</sub></span> fails open:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Diode <span class="math"><em>D</em><sub>1</sub></span> fails shorted:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Diode <span class="math"><em>D</em><sub>2</sub></span> fails open:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> fails open:</p>

<p><span class="math"> • </span> Resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>4</sub></span> fails open:</p>
<p>For each of these conditions, explain <em>why</em> the resulting effects will occur.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Diode <span class="math"><em>D</em><sub>1</sub></span> fails open: <em>No effect.</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Diode <span class="math"><em>D</em><sub>1</sub></span> fails shorted: <em>Output always in high state, possible damage to circuit when input switch is in high state.</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Diode <span class="math"><em>D</em><sub>2</sub></span> fails open: <em>Gate can sink current in low output state, but cannot source current in high output state.</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> fails open: <em>Output always in high state.</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span> fails open: <em>Gate can sink some current in low output state, but cannot source current in high output state. Gate may have trouble attaining a solid &quot;low&quot; output state as well.</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>4</sub></span> fails open: <em>Limited ability to source current in high output state.</em></p>
<p>The purpose of this question is to approach the domain of circuit troubleshooting from a perspective of knowing what the fault is, rather than only knowing what the symptoms are. Although this is not necessarily a realistic perspective, it helps students build the foundational knowledge necessary to diagnose a faulted circuit from empirical data. Questions such as this should be followed (eventually) by other questions asking students to identify likely faults based on measurements.</p>
