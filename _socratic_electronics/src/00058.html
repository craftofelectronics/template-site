<p>What will the light bulb do when the switch is open, and when the switch is closed?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00058x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>When the switch is closed, the light bulb will receive full voltage from the battery. When the switch is open, the light bulb will receive less voltage (and correspondingly, less current).</p>
<p>This is another opportunity to review the meanings of &quot;open&quot; and &quot;closed&quot; with regard to switches. Again, students new to electricity often exhibit confusion over these terms, because in the context of doors they hold opposite meanings.</p>
