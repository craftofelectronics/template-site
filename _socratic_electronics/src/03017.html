<p>Some latch circuits exhibit an &quot;invalid&quot; state under certain conditions. How do we define this &quot;invalid&quot; state? Why is it referred to as &quot;invalid,&quot; as though there were something wrong about it?</p>
<p>In the <em>invalid</em> state, <span class="math"><em>Q</em></span> and <span class="math">$\overline{Q}$</span> are at the same logic state, either both high or both low (depending on the internal construction of the latch).</p>
