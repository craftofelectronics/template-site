<p>Suppose a 12 volt lead-acid battery has an internal resistance of 20 milli-ohms (20 m<span class="math">Ω </span>):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03243x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>If a short-circuit were placed across the terminals of this large battery, the fault current would be quite large: 600 amps!</p>
<p>Now suppose three of these batteries were connected directly in parallel with one another:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03243x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Reduce this network of parallel-connected batteries into either a Thévenin or a Norton equivalent circuit, and then re-calculate the fault current available at the terminals of the three-battery &quot;bank&quot; in the event of a direct short-circuit.</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>I</em><sub><em>f</em><em>a</em><em>u</em><em>l</em><em>t</em></sub></span> = 1800 amps</p>
<p>Follow-up question: explain what practical importance this question has for parallel-connected batteries, and how either Thévenin’s or Norton’s theorems makes the concept easier to explain to someone else. What safety issues might be raised by the parallel connection of large batteries such as these?</p>
<p>Ask your students whether they used Thévenin’s Theorem or Norton’s theorem to solve for the fault current. Have students demonstrate the analysis both ways to see which is easiest to understand.</p>
