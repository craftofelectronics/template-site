<p>We know that the formula relating instantaneous voltage and current in an inductor is this:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$e = L{di \over dt}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Knowing this, determine at what points on this sine wave plot for inductor current is the inductor voltage equal to zero, and where the voltage is at its positive and negative peaks. Then, connect these points to draw the waveform for inductor voltage:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00576x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>How much phase shift (in degrees) is there between the voltage and current waveforms? Which waveform is leading and which waveform is lagging?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00576x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>For an inductor, voltage is leading and current is lagging, by a phase shift of 90<span class="math">$^{o}$</span>.</p>
<p>This question is an excellent application of the calculus concept of the <em>derivative</em>: relating one function (instantaneous voltage, <span class="math"><em>e</em></span>) with the instantaneous rate-of-change of another function (current, <span class="math">$di \over dt$</span>).</p>
