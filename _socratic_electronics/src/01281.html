<p>What does it mean if you see a logic gate symbol in a schematic diagram with a strange-looking &quot;S&quot; figure drawn inside of it?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01281x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The &quot;S&quot; figure, which resembles a magnetic B-H hysteresis curve, marks this gate as a <em>Schmitt trigger</em>. I’ll let you do the research to determine what this means in regard to gate function.</p>
<p>Schmitt trigger gates are indispensable for certain logic circuit applications. It is important that students recognize their function and utility.</p>
<p>Incidentally, this question provides a good opportunity to review magnetic hysteresis curves, since it’s probably been awhile since students last studied electromagnetism theory!</p>
