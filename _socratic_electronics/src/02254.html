<p>This astable multivibrator circuit will oscillate with a 50% duty cycle if the components are symmetrically sized:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02254x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Determine which component(s) would have to be re-sized to produce a duty cycle other than 50%.</p>
<p>I wonâ€™t answer this question directly, but I will give a large hint: <span class="math"><em>C</em><sub>1</sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span> determine the pulse width of one-half of the square wave, while <span class="math"><em>C</em><sub>2</sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>3</sub></span> control the pulse width of the other half:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02254x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Challenge question: re-draw the schematic diagram to show how a potentiometer could be used to make the duty cycle adjustable over a wide range.</p>
<p>Astable multivibrator circuits are simple and versatile, making them good subjects of study and discussion for your students.</p>
