<p>Suppose you had an astable multivibrator circuit that output a very precise 1 Hz square-wave signal, but you had an application which requires a pulse once every <em>minute</em> rather than once every second. Knowing that there are 60 seconds in a minute, can you think of a way to use digital counters to act as a &quot;frequency divider&quot; so that every 60 multivibrator pulses equates to 1 output pulse?</p>
<p>You don’t have a divide-by-60 counter available, but you do have several divide-by-10 (&quot;decade&quot;) counters at your disposal. Engineer a solution using these counter units:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01405x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Note: assume these counter ICs have <em>asynchronous</em> resets.</p>
<p>Cascade two decade counters together, with a NAND gate to decode when the output is equal to 60:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01405x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Follow-up question: why can’t we take the divide-by-60 pulse from the RCO output of the second counter, as we could with the divide-by-10 pulse from the first counter?</p>
<p>Challenge question: re-design this circuit so that the output is a square wave with a duty cycle of 50% (&quot;high&quot; for 30 seconds, then &quot;low&quot; for 30 seconds), rather than a narrow pulse every 60 seconds.</p>
<p>Tell your students that counter circuits are quite often used as frequency dividers. Discuss the challenge question with them, letting them propose and discuss multiple solutions to the problem.</p>
<p>The &quot;note&quot; in the question about the asynchronous nature of the counter reset inputs is very important, as synchronous-reset counter ICs would not behave the same. Discuss this with your students, showing them how counters with synchronous reset inputs would yield a divide-by-61 ratio.</p>
<p>Incidentally, a divide-by-60 counter circuit is precisely what we would need to arrive at a 1 Hz pulse waveform from a 60 Hz powerline frequency signal, which is a neat &quot;trick&quot; for obtaining a low-speed clock of relatively good accuracy without requiring a crystal-controlled local oscillator. (Where the &quot;mains&quot; power is 50 Hz instead of 60 Hz, you would need a divide-by-50 counter – I know, I know . . .) If time permits, ask your students to think of how they could condition the 60Hz sine-wave (120 volt!) standard powerline voltage into a 60 Hz square-wave pulse suitable for input into such a frequency divider/counter circuit.</p>
