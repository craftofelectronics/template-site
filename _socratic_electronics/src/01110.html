<p>Explain how a <em>surge protector</em> functions: the kind of device used to protect electronic equipment against common power line voltage transients. Draw a schematic diagram to accompany your explanation.</p>
<p>Some surge protectors use varistors, others use zener diodes, and others use more advanced technologies. Iâ€™ll let you research designs and schematic diagrams on your own!</p>
<p>Ask students how a surge protector (or surge &quot;suppressor&quot;) is similar in principle to <em>clipper</em> circuits used for small electronic signals.</p>
