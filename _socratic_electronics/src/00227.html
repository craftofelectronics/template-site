<p>What will happen, electrically speaking, when the shaft of the machine is turned?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00227x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>A voltage will be &quot;induced&quot; in the wire coil as the magnet passes by.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: do you think the voltage generated by this machine would be DC or AC? Explain your answer.</p>
<p>Although this machine would not be very efficient in the form shown in the illustration, it would work to generate electricity when turned. As such, it demonstrates the principle of electromagnetic induction.</p>
