<p>An electrical lineman is connecting three single-phase transformers in a Y(primary)-Y(secondary) configuration, for power service to a business. Draw the connecting wires necessary between the transformer windings, and between the transformer terminals and the lines:</p>

<p>Note: fuses have been omitted from this illustration, for simplicity.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00424x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Of course, this is not the only way these three transformers could be connected in a Y-Y configuration.</p>
<p>Being that pole-mounted power distribution transformers are exposed for anyone to look at, they provide an excellent opportunity for students to practice identifying three-phase connections. If there are any such transformer configurations located near your campus, it would be an interesting field exercise to bring students there (or send them there on &quot;field research&quot;!) to identify the connections. Photographs of transformer connections may also be used in the classroom to provide practical examples of this concept.</p>
