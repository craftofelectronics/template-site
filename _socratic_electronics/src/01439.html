<p>Define the following terms, as they relate to digital memory devices:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> RAM:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> ROM:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Volatile:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Nonvolatile:</p>
<p>In particular, explain why &quot;RAM&quot; is a misleading term.</p>
<p><em>ROM</em> stands for Read-Only Memory, which means it can only be written to once. <em>Volatile</em> and <em>Nonvolatile</em> refer to whether or not stored data is lost when the device is powered down.</p>
<p>Technically, <em>RAM</em> means Random-Access Memory, where data stored in memory may be accessed without having to &quot;sift through&quot; all the other bits of data in sequential order. In practice, however, the term RAM is used to designate the volatile electronic memory inside a computer, which just happens to be randomly accessible.</p>
<p>The mis-use of the acronym &quot;RAM&quot; is another unfortunate entry in the lexicon of electronics. Your students are sure to have questions about this term, so be prepared to discuss it with them!</p>
