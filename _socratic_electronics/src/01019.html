<p>Identify the mathematical function of this circuit (if you look closely, you’ll notice that the transistors are connected in such a way that they act very similar to diodes):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01019x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Note: the two resistors labeled &quot;R&quot; are equal in value.</p>
<p>This circuit <em>squares</em> the input signal (<span class="math"><em>y</em> = <em>x</em><sup>2</sup></span>).</p>
<p>Challenge question: why are transistors used instead of diodes, since they have been effectively &quot;disabled&quot; to act as such?</p>
<p>This circuit is not nearly as complex as it may appear at first, if students take the time to isolate it section-by-section and identify the mathematical function each section performs.</p>
