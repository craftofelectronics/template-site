<p>A very common design of AC motor is the so-called <em>squirrel cage</em> motor. Describe how a &quot;squirrel cage&quot; motor is built, and classify it as either an &quot;induction&quot; motor or a &quot;synchronous&quot; motor.</p>
<p>There is a lot of information on &quot;squirrel cage&quot; electric motors. I will leave it to you to do the research.</p>
<p>Although it is easy enough for students to find information on squirrel cage motors classifying them as either induction or synchronous, you should challenge your students to <em>explain</em> why it is one type or the other. The goal here, as always, is <em>comprehension</em> over <em>memorization</em>.</p>
