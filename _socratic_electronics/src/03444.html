<p>What type of diode is always packaged in a clear glass or plastic body (as opposed to an opaque plastic body)? Explain how the appearance of the component is helpful in determining its identity.</p>
<p>This is a nasty, trick question! The physical appearance of any semiconductor component is a poor indication of its identity. Many small zener diodes are packaged in clear bodies, but this does not mean all clear-bodied diodes are zeners, nor that all zeners are found in clear packages! The <em>part number</em> of a diode is the only reliable indicator of its identity.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: the physical <em>size</em> of a component is often an indication of what performance parameter?</p>
<p>I usually do not ask &quot;trick&quot; questions such as this, but occasionally they work really well to get the point across.</p>
