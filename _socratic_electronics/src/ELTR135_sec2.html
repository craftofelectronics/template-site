<p>This circuit can be difficult to grasp, because there is a tendency to immediately apply one of the &quot;canonical rules&quot; of opamp circuits: that there is negligible voltage between the inverting and noninverting inputs when negative feedback is present. It is wrong to apply this rule here, though, because this circuit’s behavior is dominated by <em>positive</em> feedback. This positive feedback comes through a plain resistor network, while the negative feedback comes through a &quot;first-order lag&quot; RC time constant network, which means the positive feedback is immediate while the negative feedback is delayed. Because of this, the opamp output swings back and forth between saturated states, and never settles to an equilibrium position. Thus, it does not act like a simple amplifier and there will be substantial voltage between the two opamp inputs.</p>
<p>A better way to consider this circuit is to think of it as a comparator with hysteresis, the inverting input &quot;chasing&quot; the output with a time lag.</p>
<p>When studying integrator and differentiator circuits, one must think in terms of how fast a variable is changing. This is the first hurdle in calculus: to comprehend what a rate of change is, and it is not obvious. One thing I really like about teaching electronics is that capacitor and inductors naturally exhibit the calculus principles of integration and differentiation (with respect to time), and so provide an excellent context in which the electronics student may explore basic principles of calculus. Integrator and differentiator circuits exploit these properties, so that the output voltage is approximately either the time-integral or time-derivative (respectively) of the input voltage signal.</p>
<p>It is helpful, though, to relate these principles to more ordinary contexts, which is why I often describe rates of change in terms of <em>velocity</em> and <em>acceleration</em>. Velocity is nothing more than a rate of change of position: how quickly one’s position is changing over time. Therefore, if the variable <span class="math"><em>x</em></span> describes position, then the derivative <span class="math">${dx \over dt}$</span> (rate of change of <span class="math"><em>x</em></span> over time <span class="math"><em>t</em></span>) must describe velocity. Likewise, acceleration is nothing more than the rate of change of velocity: how quickly velocity changes over time. If the variable <span class="math"><em>v</em></span> describes velocity, then the derivative <span class="math">${dv \over dt}$</span> must describe velocity. Or, since we know that velocity is itself the derivative of position, we could describe acceleration as the <em>second derivative</em> of position: <span class="math">${d^2 x \over dt^2}$</span></p>
<p>The two foundational concepts of calculus are inversely related: <em>differentiation</em> and <em>integration</em> are flip-sides of the same coin. That is to say, one &quot;un-does&quot; the other. If you can grasp what one of these operations is, then the other is simply the reverse.</p>
<p>One of the better ways to illustrate the inverse nature of these two operations is to consider them in the context of motion analysis, relating <em>position</em> (<span class="math"><em>x</em></span>), velocity (<span class="math"><em>v</em></span>), and <em>acceleration</em> (<span class="math"><em>a</em></span>). Differentiating with respect to time, the derivative of position is velocity (<span class="math">$v = {dx \over dt}$</span>), and the derivative of velocity is acceleration (<span class="math">$a = {dv \over dt}$</span>). Integrating with respect to time, the integral of acceleration is velocity (<span class="math"><em>v</em> = ∫ <em>a</em> <em>d</em><em>t</em></span>) and the integral of velocity is position (<span class="math"><em>x</em> = ∫ <em>v</em> <em>d</em><em>t</em></span>).</p>
<p>Fortunately, electronics provides a ready context in which to understand differentiation and integration. It is very easy to build <em>differentiator</em> and <em>integrator</em> circuits, which take a voltage signal input and differentiate or integrate (respectively) that signal with respect to time. This means if we have a voltage signal from a velocity sensor measuring the velocity of an object (such as a robotic arm, for example), we may send that signal through a differentiator circuit to obtain a voltage signal representing the robotic arm’s acceleration, or we may send the velocity signal through a integrator circuit to obtain a voltage signal representing the robotic arm’s position.</p>
