<p>Draw the schematic symbol for a <em>Schottky diode</em>, and give some examples of typical applications for it.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02069x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>I’ll let you research some of the typical applications of Schottky diodes.</p>
<p>Ask your students to explain why the applications of Schottky diodes are well suited for these diodes’ unique capabilities. What is it about the typical applications that make use of these diodes’ fast reverse-recovery times and/or low forward voltage drop?</p>
<p>Note to your students that the schematic symbol for a Schottky diode is easily confused with the schematic symbol for a <em>zener</em> diode. Pay close attention to the symbol!</p>
