<p>Predict how the operation of this sawtooth-wave oscillator circuit will be affected as a result of the following faults. Consider each fault independently (i.e. one at a time, no multiple faults):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03756x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Capacitor <span class="math"><em>C</em><sub>1</sub></span> fails shorted:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> fails open:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> JFET fails shorted (drain-to-source):</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>3</sub></span> fails open:</p>
<p>For each of these conditions, explain <em>why</em> the resulting effects will occur.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Capacitor <span class="math"><em>C</em><sub>1</sub></span> fails shorted: <em>No oscillation, low DC voltage output.</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> fails open: <em>No oscillation, low DC voltage output.</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> JFET fails shorted (drain-to-source): <em>Oscillation waveform looks &quot;rounded&quot; instead of having a straight leading edge, frequency is higher than normal.</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>3</sub></span> fails open: <em>No oscillation, high DC voltage output.</em></p>
<p>The purpose of this question is to approach the domain of circuit troubleshooting from a perspective of knowing what the fault is, rather than only knowing what the symptoms are. Although this is not necessarily a realistic perspective, it helps students build the foundational knowledge necessary to diagnose a faulted circuit from empirical data. Questions such as this should be followed (eventually) by other questions asking students to identify likely faults based on measurements.</p>
