<p>In the following circuit, an adjustable voltage source is connected in series with a resistive load and another voltage source:</p>

<p>Determine what will happen to the current in this circuit if the adjustable voltage source is increased.</p>
<p>In this next circuit, an adjustable voltage source is connected in series with a resistive load and a <em>current</em> source:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03224x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Now determine what will happen to the current in this second circuit if the adjustable voltage source is increased.</p>
<p>One way to define electrical resistance is by comparing the <em>change</em> in applied voltage (<span class="math">Δ <em>V</em></span>) to the <em>change</em> in resultant current (<span class="math">Δ <em>I</em></span>). This is mathematically expressed by the following ratio:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$R = {\Delta V \over \Delta I}$</span><br /></p>
<p>From the perspective of the adjustable voltage source (<span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>a</em><em>d</em><em>j</em><em>u</em><em>s</em><em>t</em></sub></span>), and as defined by the above equation, which of these two circuits has the greatest resistance? What does this result suggest about the equivalent resistance of a constant-voltage source versus the equivalent resistance of a constant-current source?</p>
<p>In the first circuit, current will increase as <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>a</em><em>d</em><em>j</em><em>u</em><em>s</em><em>t</em></sub></span> is increased, yielding a finite total resistance. In the second circuit, current will remain constant as <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>a</em><em>d</em><em>j</em><em>u</em><em>s</em><em>t</em></sub></span> is increased, yielding an infinite total resistance.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: calculate <span class="math"><em>R</em></span> as defined by the formula <span class="math">${\Delta V \over \Delta I}$</span> for these two circuits, assuming <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>a</em><em>d</em><em>j</em><em>u</em><em>s</em><em>t</em></sub></span> changes from 15 volts to 16 volts (1 volt <span class="math">Δ <em>V</em></span>):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03224x03.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>If students are unable to analyze the two circuits qualitatively as suggested in the question, the follow-up question should clear things up. The point of all this, of course, is for students to see that a constant voltage source has zero internal resistance and that a constant current source has infinite internal resistance.</p>
<p>In case anyone should ask, the proper definition for resistance is expressed as a derivative. That is, instead of <span class="math">$R = {\Delta V \over \Delta I}$</span> we should have <span class="math">$R = {dV \over dI}$</span>.</p>
