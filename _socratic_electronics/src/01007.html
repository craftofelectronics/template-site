<p>Ideally, an inverting amplifier circuit may be comprised of just one op-amp and two resistors, as such:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01007x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>However, if high accuracy is desired, a third resistor must be added to the circuit, in series with the other op-amp input:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01007x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Explain what this &quot;compensation&quot; resistor is compensating for, and also what its value should be.</p>
<p>The compensation resistor compensates for errors introduced into the voltage divider network due to input bias current. Its value should be equal to the parallel equivalent of <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>i</em><em>n</em><em>p</em><em>u</em><em>t</em></sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>f</em><em>e</em><em>e</em><em>d</em><em>b</em><em>a</em><em>c</em><em>k</em></sub></span>.</p>
<p>First, your students will have to know what &quot;bias currents&quot; are in op-amp circuits, so begin your discussion of this question with a call for this definition. Why the compensation resistor value must be equal to the <em>parallel</em> equivalent of the two resistors in the voltage divider is something that confuses most students. The key to understanding it is network analysis, in particular Thévenin’s and Norton’s theorems.</p>
