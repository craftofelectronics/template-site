<p>A particular RAM memory chip has twelve address lines (<span class="math"><em>A</em><sub>0</sub></span> through <span class="math"><em>A</em><sub>11</sub></span>) and four data lines (<span class="math"><em>D</em><sub>0</sub></span> through <span class="math"><em>D</em><sub>3</sub></span>), in addition to the power terminals and other inputs:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03081x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>How many unique locations (addresses) does this memory chip have in which to store binary numbers? How many bits of data are stored in each of those locations?</p>
<p>4096 addresses, 4 bits of data each.</p>
