<p>Determine what a digital voltmeter (DVM) would indicate if connected between the following points in this circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00344x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Red lead on A, black lead on H</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Red lead on C, black lead on G</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Red lead on F, black lead on B</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Red lead on F, black lead on A</p>
<p>Here is a schematic diagram to help you:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00344x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Red lead on A, black lead on H = +24 volts</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Red lead on C, black lead on G = +12 volts</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Red lead on F, black lead on B = -12 volts</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Red lead on F, black lead on A = -18 volts</p>
<p>Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law (KVL) is very easily explored in real life with a set of batteries and &quot;jumper wire&quot; connections. Encourage your students to build battery circuits like the one shown in this question, to be able to see the results for themselves!</p>
<p>One really nice feature of digital multimeters (DMMs) is the ability to register negative as well as positive quantities. This feature is very useful when teaching Kirchhoff’s Laws, with the <em>algebraic</em> (sign-dependent) summation of voltages and currents.</p>
