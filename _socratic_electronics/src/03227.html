<p>Suppose you were handed a black box with two metal terminals on one side, for attaching electrical (wire) connections. Inside this box, you were told, was a voltage source connected in series with a resistance.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03227x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Your task was to experimentally determine the values of the voltage source and the resistor inside the box, and you did just that. From your experimental data you then sketched a circuit with the following component values:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03227x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>However, you later discovered that you had been tricked. Instead of containing a single voltage source and a single resistance, the circuit inside the box actually looked like this:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03227x03.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Demonstrate that these two different circuits are indistinguishable from the perspective of the two metal terminals, and explain what general principle this equivalence represents.</p>
<p>A good way to demonstrate the electrical equivalence of these circuits is to calculate their responses to identical load resistor values. The equivalence you see here is an application of <em>Thévenin’s Theorem</em>.</p>
<p>Ask your students to clearly state Thévenin’s Theorem, and explain how it may be applied to the two-resistor circuit to obtain the one-resistor circuit.</p>
