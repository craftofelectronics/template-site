<p>When a coil of wire &quot;cuts through&quot; magnetic lines of flux, what phenomenon occurs?</p>
<p>Electromagnetic induction.</p>
<p>Be sure that students understand the answer to this question beyond saying the phrase, &quot;electromagnetic induction.&quot; What, exactly, does this phrase mean? Reciting an equation is not a sufficient explanation, either. Ask them what some of the factors are that influence the strength of the inductive effect.</p>
