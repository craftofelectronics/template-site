<p>When securing equipment for safe maintenance, special <em>tags</em> are attached with the lock(s) used to keep circuit breakers and other disconnect devices in the open (off) state. A typical &quot;lockout&quot; tag looks something like this:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00573x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>What is the purpose of attaching such a tag to an electrical disconnect device in addition to locking it in the open position? Why is a lock, by itself, not sufficient from a safety perspective?</p>
<p>A tag informs anyone wishing to turn the disconnect device &quot;on&quot; as to <em>when</em> it was turned off, and <em>who</em> placed the lock(s) on it. Many lockout tags have space on for a written description so that the reason for the lockout may be explained.</p>
<p>Discuss with your students the need for good communication between all people performing maintenance work on large and (potentially) dangerous systems. Tags are an integral part of this communication.</p>
