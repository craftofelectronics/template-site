<p>Explain what a <em>window comparator</em> circuit is (sometimes called a <em>window discriminator</em>), and identify at least one practical application for one.</p>
<p>A &quot;window comparator&quot; circuit detects when a voltage falls between two different reference voltages. Iâ€™ll let you figure out some practical applications for such a circuit!</p>
<p>Ask your students where they found the answer for this question, and further explore some of the practical applications they offer.</p>
