<p>Explain how the following decimal-to-BCD encoder circuit works:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03003x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Also, determine which output (<span class="math"><em>D</em></span> or <span class="math"><em>A</em></span>) is the <em>most significant bit</em> of the BCD output.</p>
<p>Iâ€™ll let you figure out the details of how this circuit functions, but I will tell you that <span class="math"><em>D</em></span> is the MSB.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: what would have to be modified in order to turn this into a hexadecimal-to-binary (16 line to 4 line) encoder? Would any additional OR gates have to be added to the circuit?</p>
<p>Non-priority encoder circuits such as this one are fairly simple to figure out, and so I do not provide an explanation for students in the &quot;Answer&quot; section.</p>
