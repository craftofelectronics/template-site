<p>The following graph is a family of characteristic curves for a particular transistor:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02245x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Draw the load line and identify the Q-point on that load line for a common-emitter amplifier circuit using this transistor:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02245x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02245x03.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Follow-up question: determine what would happen to the Q-point if resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span> (the 2.2 k<span class="math">Ω </span> biasing resistor) were to fail open.</p>
<p>The purpose of this question is to get students to relate their existing knowledge of common-emitter circuit DC analysis to the concept of load lines and Q-points. Ask your students to share their analysis techniques with the whole class.</p>
