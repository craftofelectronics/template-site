<p>How large must inductor <span class="math"><em>L</em><sub><em>x</em></sub></span> be in order to provide a total inductance of 2.5 H in this network of inductors?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00381x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>2.145 H</p>
<p>Inductors tend to be even more scarce than resistors in regard to the availability of different values, so knowing how to combine different inductors together to achieve a desired total inductance is a practical skill.</p>
<p>It should be noted to your students that inductors may interact with one another if placed too close, due to the magnetic field of one inductor &quot;linking&quot; with the coil of another inductor. This is called <em>mutual inductance</em>, and if present alters the otherwise straightforward series-parallel inductance relationships that one would expect to be analogous to series-parallel resistances.</p>
