<p>The amount of voltage applied to a permanent-magnet DC motor, and the amount of current going through the armature windings of a permanent-magnet DC motor, are related to two mechanical quantities: maximum speed, and torque output (twisting force).</p>
<p>Which electrical quantity relates to which mechanical quantity? Is it voltage that relates to speed and current to torque, or visa-versa? Explain your answer.</p>
<p>The amount of voltage applied to a permanent-magnet DC motor determines its no-load speed, while the amount of current through the armature windings is indicative of the torque output.</p>
<p>This question asks students to relate concepts of electromagnetism and electromagnetic induction together with voltage and current. While the permanent-magnet style of DC motor exhibits almost linear relationships between these variables, all DC electric motors exhibit the same general pattern: more voltage, more speed; more current, more torque; all other variables being equal.</p>
