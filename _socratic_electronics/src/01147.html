<p>Suppose that a &quot;noisy&quot; AC signal of otherwise constant frequency is connected to the input of a phase-locked loop circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01147x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Characterize the output waveform generated by the VCO. Will it be &quot;noisy&quot; as well? Why or why not?</p>
<p>The VCOâ€™s output waveform will not be noisy like the input waveform.</p>
<p>Ask your students how this behavior of the PLL circuit could be advantageous. What practical purpose(s) can students think of for a PLL, used as such?</p>
