<p>Of the three types of &quot;elementary particles&quot; constituting atoms, determine which type(s) influence the following properties of an element:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> The chemical identity of the atoms (whether it is an atom of <em>nitrogen</em>, <em>iron</em>, <em>silver</em>, or some other element).</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> The mass of the atom.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> The electrical charge of the atom.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Whether or not it is radioactive (spontaneous disintegration of the nucleus).</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> The chemical identity of the atoms: <strong>protons</strong>.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> The mass of the atom: <strong>neutrons</strong> and <strong>protons</strong>, and to a much lesser extent, <strong>electrons</strong>.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> The electrical charge of the atom: <strong>electrons</strong> and <strong>protons</strong> (whether or not the numbers are equal).</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Whether or not it is radioactive: <strong>neutrons</strong>, although one might also say <strong>protons</strong> in some cases, as there are no known &quot;stable&quot; (non-radioactive) isotopes of certain elements, the identity of an element being determined strictly by the number of protons.</p>
<p>It never ceases to fascinate me how many of the basic properties of elements is determined by a simple integer count of particles within each atom’s nucleus.</p>
<p>In the answer, I introduce the word <em>isotope</em>. Let students research what this term means. Don’t simply tell them!</p>
