<p>The following circuit is a two-bit synchronous binary up/down counter:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01399x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Explain what would happen if the upper AND gate’s output were to become &quot;stuck&quot; in the high state regardless of its input conditions. What effect would this kind of failure have on the counter’s operation?</p>
<p>The counter would not be able to count in the &quot;up&quot; direction. When commanded to count that direction, the LSB would toggle between 0 and 1, but the MSB would not change state.</p>
<p>The purpose of this question is to get students to understand how a synchronous up/down counter works, in the context of analyzing the effects of a component failure.</p>
