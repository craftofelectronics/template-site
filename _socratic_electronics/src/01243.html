<p>Comparators with positive feedback are sometimes referred to as <em>Schmitt triggers</em>. Suppose you needed a Schmitt trigger for a circuit you were building, but did not have any more integrated circuit comparators or op-amps to use. All you have available to you are discrete components. Is there any way you can think of to modify the following discrete transistor differential pair so that it behaves as a Schmitt trigger?</p>

<p>Ask your students to determine whether this Schmitt trigger circuit is inverting or non-inverting. Have them explain their reasoning step-by-step.</p>
<p>Authors Paul Horowitz and Winfield Hill, in their book , say that <span class="math"><em>Q</em><sub>1</sub></span>’s collector resistor must be larger than <span class="math"><em>Q</em><sub>2</sub></span>’s collector resistor in order for this circuit to work properly (page 232, second edition).</p>
