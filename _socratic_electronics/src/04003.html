<p>A two-conductor cable of uniform construction will exhibit a uniform <em>characteristic impedance</em> (<span class="math"><em>Z</em><sub>0</sub></span>) due to its intrinsic, distributed inductance and capacitance:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{04003x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>What would happen to the value of this characteristic impedance if we were to make the cable narrower, so that the conductors were closer together, all other dimensions remaining the same?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{04003x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math"><em>Z</em><sub>0</sub></span> would <em>decrease</em>. I will leave it to you to explain why this happens.</p>
<p>Be sure to ask your students to explain why the characteristic impedance will change in the direction it does, based on the known changes to both capacitance and inductance throughout the cable. It should fairly simple for students to explain why capacitance will increase as the two conductors are brought closer together, but it may not be as apparent why the inductance will decrease. A good &quot;Socratic&quot; question to ask is about magnetic field strength, assuming one end of the cable were shorted, and a DC current source connected to the other end. Be sure to remind them to discuss the right-hand corkscrew rule for current and magnetic fields in their answer to this follow-up question!</p>
