<p>How will the oscilloscope trigger if the control is set to <em>Line</em> source rather than <strong>A</strong> or <strong>B</strong> inputs:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01910x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>In this mode, the oscilloscope triggers off the power-line waveform.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: what circumstance can you think of that would require this triggering source?</p>
<p>&quot;Line&quot; triggering is a very useful feature, especially for working on line-powered and line-synchronized circuits. SCR- and TRIAC-based motor control circuits come immediately to mind here, as do brute-force (linear) power supply circuits!</p>
