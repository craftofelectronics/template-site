<p>Now, trace the flow of all currents in the other half of the AC cycle (note the polarity symbols near the transformer’s primary winding terminals):</p>

<p>Also, determine the polarity of DC voltage across the load resistor.</p>

<p>This question not only introduces a type of full-wave rectifying circuit, but it also serves as a good review of transformer action and winding phase markings. I have omitted diagrams showing direction of currents in this circuit, partly because they may be ascertained by way of the load resistor’s voltage polarity (shown in the answer), and partly because I’d rather not have to choose between giving an answer in conventional flow notation versus electron flow notation.</p>
