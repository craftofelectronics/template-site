<p>Although the model 741 operational amplifier is considered obsolete by many modern standards, it is still a suitable circuit for this kind of exploration with students. Being able to look over a schematic diagram and figure out what the components do is an important troubleshooting skill. The fact that human circuit designers tend to repeat specific circuit elements and &quot;modules&quot; (such as the common-collector amplifier or the current mirror) in their designs rather than invent something completely novel for each design simplifies the task of later interpretation.</p>
