<p>This circuit is known as a <em>midrange crossover</em> in stereo system design.</p>
<p>This is an interesting circuit to analyze. Note how, out of the three frequency points we performed calculations at, the speaker’s voltage is greatest at the <em>middle</em> frequency. Note also how the inductor and capacitor drop very disparate amounts of voltage at the high and low frequencies. Discuss this circuit’s behavior with your students, and ask them what practical function this circuit performs.</p>
<p>Students often have difficulty formulating a method of solution: determining what steps to take to get from the given conditions to a final answer. While it is helpful at first for you (the instructor) to show them, it is bad for you to show them too often, lest they stop thinking for themselves and merely follow your lead. A teaching technique I have found very helpful is to have students come up to the board (alone or in teams) in front of class to write their problem-solving strategies for all the others to see. They don’t have to actually do the math, but rather outline the steps they would take, in the order they would take them. The following is a sample of a written problem-solving strategy for analyzing a series resistive-reactive AC circuit:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Calculate all reactances (<span class="math"><em>X</em></span>).</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Draw an impedance triangle (<span class="math"><em>Z</em></span> ; <span class="math"><em>R</em></span> ; <span class="math"><em>X</em></span>), solving for <span class="math"><em>Z</em></span></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Calculate circuit current using Ohm’s Law: <span class="math">$I = {V \over Z}$</span></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Calculate series voltage drops using Ohm’s Law: <span class="math"><em>V</em> = <em>I</em><em>Z</em></span></p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Check work by drawing a voltage triangle (<span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>t</em><em>o</em><em>t</em><em>a</em><em>l</em></sub></span> ; <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub>1</sub></span> ; <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub>2</sub></span>), solving for <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>t</em><em>o</em><em>t</em><em>a</em><em>l</em></sub></span></p>
<p>By having students outline their problem-solving strategies, everyone gets an opportunity to see multiple methods of solution, and you (the instructor) get to see how (and if!) your students are thinking. An especially good point to emphasize in these &quot;open thinking&quot; activities is how to check your work to see if any mistakes were made.</p>
