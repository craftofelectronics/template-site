<p>Explain what will happen in this circuit when each pushbutton switch is individually actuated:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02126x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Can you think of any practical applications for a circuit like this?</p>
<p>This circuit is commonly known as a <em>bistable</em> latch, since it is able to &quot;latch&quot; into two different stable states.</p>
<p>If you experience difficulty analyzing this circuitâ€™s operation, imagine that one of the transistors is in the &quot;on&quot; state and the other is in the &quot;off&quot; state immediately after power-up. Then ask yourself what will happen when each pushbutton is actuated.</p>
<p>Bistable latch, or multivibrator, circuits are quite useful and quite simple to implement with MOSFETs as this example demonstrates. Discuss some practical applications with your students, especially if they have not discovered a few applications of their own.</p>
