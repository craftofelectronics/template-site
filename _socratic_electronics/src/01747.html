<p>Which way would you have to move the potentiometer wiper, to the left or to the right, in order to increase current through resistor R1?</p>

<p>You would have to move the potentiometer wiper to the <em>left</em>.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: what would happen to the current through resistor R2 as you moved the wiper in that direction (closer to resistor R1)?</p>
<p>This circuit is fairly self-explanatory.</p>
