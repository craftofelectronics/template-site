<p>What, exactly, is an electric <em>arc</em>? What conditions typically lead to the formation of an arc?</p>
<p>An electric &quot;arc&quot; is a discharge of current through the air. Arcs may be caused by excessive voltage ionizing an air path between two conductors, or from accidental contact (and subsequent re-separation) between two conductors.</p>
<p>Discuss the subject of &quot;ionization&quot; of gases. Air is normally an insulator of electricity, but it becomes a conductor when ionized. Ask your students what happens to a gas when it becomes ionized. Ask them to tell you what the word &quot;ionized&quot; means.</p>
