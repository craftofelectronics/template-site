<p>If a semiconductor PN junction is reverse-biased, ideally no continuous current will go through it. However, in real life there will be a small amount of reverse-bias current that goes through the junction. How is this possible? What allows this reverse current to flow?</p>
<p>Minority carriers allow reverse current through a PN junction.</p>
<p>Review with your students what &quot;minority carriers&quot; are, and apply this concept to the PN junction. Trace the motions of these minority carriers, and compare them with the motions of majority carriers in a forward-biased PN junction.</p>
