<p>The predicted value should be easy enough to figure out, given this is nothing more than a resistive voltage divider. If you are not configuring the oscilloscope properly, you will not get the correct measurement value!</p>
<p>The nature of the AC signal source is not crucial, so long as an accurate peak measurement may be obtained. I recommend specifying equal-value resistors to make the voltage drop calculation as easy as possible. The purpose of this exercise is not how to calculate voltage divider outputs, but rather how to utilize both inputs of a dual-trace oscilloscope to perform <em>differential</em> voltage measurements.</p>
