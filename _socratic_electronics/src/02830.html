<p>Use DeMorganâ€™s Theorem, as well as any other applicable rules of Boolean algebra, to simplify the following expression so there are no more complementation bars extending over multiple variables:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\overline{ \overline{J + K} JL }$</span><br /></p>
<p>Simplified expression:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\hbox{(Expression is always equal to 1)}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Have your students demonstrate exactly what they did (step by step) to simplify this expression, sharing their problem-solving strategies with the whole class.</p>
<p>Ask your students to determine what a non-variable solution means for a circuit such as this in a practical sense. What would they suspect if they tried to simplify a digital circuit and obtained this kind of result?</p>
