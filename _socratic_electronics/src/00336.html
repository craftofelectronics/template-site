<p>Choose two resistor values such that one resistor passes 25% of the total current, while the other resistor passes 75% of the total current:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00336x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>There are many combinations of resistor values that will satisfy these criteria.</p>
<p>This is a fine example of a question with multiple correct answers. No matter how many unique combinations students invent, they may all be verified by a few simple Ohmâ€™s Law calculations.</p>
