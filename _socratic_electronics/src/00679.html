<p>Suppose that a length of electrical wire is wrapped around a section of an iron torus, and electric current conducted through the wire:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00679x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>What factors influence the amount of MMF, flux, and reluctance in this magnetic &quot;circuit&quot;?</p>
<p>MMF is determined by the amount of current through the wire coil, and the number of turns in the coil (<span class="math">${\cal F} = I N$</span>). Reluctance is determined by the cross-sectional area of the magnetic flux path, the length of that path, the type of material the torus is made of, <em>and the amount of flux present in the torus</em>. Magnetic flux is determined by the MMF and reluctance.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: how similar are these relationships to voltage, resistance, and current in an electrical circuit? Note any similarities as well as any differences.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most interesting part of the answer to this question is that magnetic reluctance (<span class="math">ℜ</span>) changes with the amount of flux (<span class="math">Φ </span>) in the &quot;circuit&quot;. At first, this may seem quite different from electrical circuits, where resistance (<span class="math"><em>R</em></span>) is constant regardless of current (<span class="math"><em>I</em></span>).</p>
<p>However, the constancy of electrical resistance is something easily taken for granted. Ask your students to think of electrical devices (or phenomena) where resistance is not stable over a wide range of currents. After some discussion, you should find that the phenomenon of constant resistance is not as common as one might think!</p>
<p>After students have grasped this concept, ask them what it means with regard to magnetic flux (<span class="math">Φ </span>) versus MMF (<span class="math">${\cal F}$</span>). In other words, what happens to flux in a magnetic circuit as MMF is increased?</p>
