<p>If a voltmeter is to be used to directly measure the voltage of an unknown source, it must first be <em>calibrated</em> so as to ensure an accurate measurement:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00526x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>What is the minimum number of points along the meter’s range that it needs to be calibrated at, given the assumption of perfectly linear response?</p>
<p>If a voltmeter is to be used to measure the voltage of an unknown source, as a <em>differential</em> indicator only, what is the minimum number of points along its range that it needs to be calibrated at?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00526x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>A perfectly linear voltmeter, used to measure voltage directly, needs to be calibrated at <em>two</em> points along its measurement range in order to ensure measurement accuracy.</p>
<p>A voltmeter used for differential measurement need only be calibrated at a single point along its range, and that single point is zero.</p>
<p>Ask your students if the two calibration points on the meter’s range should be close together, or far apart, for the best (most comprehensive) calibration possible.</p>
<p>Discuss the easier calibration requirements of the differential meter. Challenge your students with this question: &quot;Does the measurement linearity of a voltmeter matter as much if it is used to make a differential measurement, as compared to if it is used to make a direct measurement?&quot; Why or why not?</p>
