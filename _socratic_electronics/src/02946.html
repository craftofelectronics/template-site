<p>The following expression is frequently used to calculate values of changing variables (voltage and current) in RC and LR timing circuits:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$e^{-{t \over \tau}} \hbox{\hskip 30pt or \hskip 30pt} {1 \over {e^{t \over \tau}}}$</span><br /></p>
<p>If we evaluate this expression for a time of <span class="math"><em>t</em> = 0</span>, we find that it is equal to 1 (100%). If we evaluate this expression for increasingly larger values of time (<span class="math"><em>t</em> → ∞</span>), we find that it approaches 0 (0%).</p>
<p>Based on this simple analysis, would you say that the expression <span class="math">$e^{-{t \over \tau}}$</span> describes the percentage that a variable has changed from its initial value in a timing circuit, or the percentage that it has <em>left</em> to change before it reaches its final value? To frame this question in graphical terms . . .</p>

<p>Which percentage does the expression <span class="math">$e^{-{t \over \tau}}$</span> represent in each case? Explain your answer.</p>
<p>Whether the variable in question is increasing or decreasing over time, the expression <span class="math">$e^{-{t \over \tau}}$</span> describes the percentage that a variable has left to change before it reaches its final value.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: what could you add to or modify about the expression to make it describe the percentage that a variable has already changed from its initial value? In other words, alter the expression so that it is equal to 0% at <span class="math"><em>t</em> = 0</span> and approaches 100% as <span class="math"><em>t</em></span> grows larger (<span class="math"><em>t</em> → ∞</span>).</p>
<p>It is very important for students to understand what this expression means and how it works, lest they rely solely on memorization to use it in their calculations. As I always tell my students, rote memorization <em>will</em> fail you! If a student does not comprehend why the expression works as it does, they will be helpless to retain it as an effective &quot;tool&quot; for performing calculations in the future.</p>
<p>A good way to suggest students approach a problem such as this is to imagine <span class="math"><em>t</em></span> increasing in value. As <span class="math"><em>t</em></span> grows larger, what happens to the expression’s overall value? Then, compare which of the two percentages (percentage traversed, or percentage remaining) follow the same trend. One not need touch a calculator to figure this out!</p>
