<p>The following circuit is called a <em>twin-tee</em> filter:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02579x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Research the equation predicting this circuitâ€™s &quot;notch&quot; frequency, given the component value ratios shown.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$f_{notch} = \hbox{\hskip 20pt}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$f_{notch} = {1 \over {2 \pi R C}}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Answering this question is simply a matter of research! There are many references a student could go to for information on twin-tee filters.</p>
