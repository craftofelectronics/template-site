<p>Describe what a <em>compound-wound</em> DC electric motor is, and how it compares with the other motor types youâ€™ve learned about so far.</p>
<p>&quot;Compound&quot; electric motors have both a series and a shunt field winding, giving it a hybrid operating characteristic.</p>
<p>Ask your students to draw the schematic diagram of a compound DC motor, showing both field winding sets. Also, ask them if there is any substantial difference between the construction of the two field windings (shunt versus series). One is definitely different from the other, and with good reason!</p>
