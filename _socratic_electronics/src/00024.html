<p>Where does the electricity come from that powers your home, or your school, or the streetlights along roads, or the many business establishments in your city? You will find that there are many different sources and types of sources of electrical power. In each case, try to determine where the <em>ultimate</em> source of that energy is.</p>
<p>For example, in a hydroelectric dam, the electricity is generated when falling water spins a turbine, which turns an electromechanical generator. But what continually drives the water to its &quot;uphill&quot; location so that the process is continuous? What is the <em>ultimate</em> source of energy that is being harnessed by the dam?</p>
<p>Some sources of electrical power:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Hydroelectric dams</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Nuclear power plants</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Coal and oil fired power plants</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Natural gas fired power plants</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Wood fired power plants</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Geothermal power plants</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Solar power plants</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Tidal/wave power plants</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Windmills</p>
<p>A great point of conversation here is that almost all &quot;sources&quot; of energy have a common origin. The different &quot;sources&quot; are merely variant expressions of the same true source (with exceptions, of course!).</p>
