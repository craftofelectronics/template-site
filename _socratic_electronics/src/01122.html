<p>One of the problems with capacitively-coupled amplifier circuits is poor low-frequency response: as the input signal frequency decreases, all capacitive reactances increase, leading to a decreased voltage gain. One solution to this problem is the addition of a capacitor in the collector current path of the initial transistor stage:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01122x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Explain how the presence of this &quot;compensating&quot; capacitor helps to overcome the loss of gain normally experienced as a result of the other capacitors in the circuit.</p>
<p>The additional capacitor’s rising reactance at low frequencies boosts the gain of the first transistor stage by increasing the impedance from the first transistor’s collector to the +V power supply rail.</p>
<p>This technique is commonly used in video amplifier circuits, although a complete video amplifier circuit would not be this crude (no peaking coils).</p>
