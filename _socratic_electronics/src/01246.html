<p>Real filters never exhibit perfect &quot;square-edge&quot; Bode plot responses. A typical low-pass filter circuit, for example, might have a frequency response that looks like this:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01246x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>What does the term <em>rolloff</em> refer to, in the context of filter circuits and Bode plots? Why would this parameter be important to a technician or engineer?</p>
<p>&quot;Rolloff&quot; refers to the <em>slope</em> of the Bode plot in the attenuating range of the filter circuit, usually expressed in units of decibels per octave (dB/octave) or decibels per decade (dB/decade):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01246x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Point studentsâ€™ attention to the scale used on this particular Bode plot. This is called a <em>log-log</em> scale, where neither vertical nor horizontal axis is linearly marked. This scaling allows a very wide range of conditions to be shown on a relatively small plot, and is very common in filter circuit analysis.</p>
