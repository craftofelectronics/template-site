<p>Examine the following illustration of a simple battery-switch-lamp circuit, connected together using screw-terminal blocks, each connection point on each terminal block identified by a unique number:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03302x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Determine whether or not voltage should be present between the following pairs of terminal block points with the switch in the ON position:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Points 1 and 5:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Points 6 and 7:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Points 4 and 10:</p>

<p><span class="math"> • </span> Points 9 and 10:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Points 4 and 7:</p>
<p>Now, determine whether or not voltage should be present between the following pairs of terminal block points with the switch in the OFF position:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Points 1 and 5:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Points 6 and 7:</p>

<p><span class="math"> • </span> Points 9 and 10:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Points 4 and 7:</p>
<p>Switch ON:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Points 1 and 5: <strong>Voltage!</strong></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Points 6 and 7: <em>No voltage</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Points 4 and 10: <em>No voltage</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Points 9 and 12: <strong>Voltage!</strong></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Points 6 and 12: <em>No voltage</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Points 9 and 10: <em>No voltage</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Points 4 and 7: <strong>Voltage!</strong></p>
<p>Switch OFF:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Points 1 and 5: <strong>Voltage!</strong></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Points 6 and 7: <em>No voltage</em></p>

<p><span class="math"> • </span> Points 9 and 12: <em>No voltage</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Points 6 and 12: <strong>Voltage!</strong></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Points 9 and 10: <em>No voltage</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Points 4 and 7: <strong>Voltage!</strong></p>
<p>Follow-up question: explain <em>why</em> there will be voltage or no voltage between each of these pairs of points for the two circuit conditions (switch on and switch off).</p>
<p>This question is not really a troubleshooting question per se, but the principles involved in successfully determining the presence or absence of voltage are critically important to being able to troubleshoot simple circuits using a voltmeter.</p>
<p>I have found that the concept of <em>electrically common points</em> is most helpful when students first learn to relate voltage drop with continuity (breaks or non-breaks) in a circuit. You might want them to identify which points in this circuit are electrically common to one another (in either or both switch positions).</p>
