<p>Resonant electric circuits are analogous to resonant mechanical systems. They both oscillate, and their oscillation is founded on an exchange of energy between two different forms.</p>
<p>Mechanical engineers studying vibrations in machinery sometimes use capacitors and inductors to model the physical characteristics of mechanical systems. Specifically, capacitors model <em>elasticity</em>, while inductors model <em>mass</em>.</p>
<p>Explain what mechanical quantities in a resonant system are analogous to voltage and current in a resonant circuit.</p>
<p>Mechanical force and velocity are analogous to electrical voltage and current, respectively.</p>
<p>Challenge question: specifically relate voltage and current for an inductor to force and velocity for a mass, and voltage and current for a capacitor to force and velocity for a spring. Illustrate the similarities mathematically, where possible!</p>
<p>This is a challenging question, and it is one I would reserve for students destined to become engineers. However, once answered, it brings deep insight to the phenomenon of resonance both mechanical and electrical.</p>
