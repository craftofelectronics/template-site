<p>Explain what will happen to the first load’s voltage and current in this voltage divider circuit, as a second load is connected as shown:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01781x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Ideally, the first load’s voltage and current will remain unaffected by the connection of load #2 to the circuit. In reality, there will inevitably be a slight sag in the load voltage though, because the voltage source is bound to have <em>some</em> internal resistance.</p>
<p>It is important for students to realize that the second load constitutes a separate parallel branch in the circuit, which (ideally) has no effect on the rest of the circuit.</p>
