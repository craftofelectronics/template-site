<p>We know that graphs are nothing more than collections of individual points representing correlated data in a system. Here is a plot of a transistor’s characteristic curve (for a single value of base current):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00945x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>And here is a plot of the &quot;load line&quot; for a transistor amplifier circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00945x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>For each of these graphs, pick a single point along the curve (or line) and describe what that single point represents, in real-life terms. What does any single point of data along either of these graphs <em>mean</em> in a transistor circuit?</p>
<p>If a transistor’s characteristic curve is superimposed with a load line on the same graph, what is the significance of those two plots’ intersection?</p>
<p>For a transistor’s characteristic curve, one point of data represents the amount of current that will go through the collector terminal for a given amount of base current, and a given amount of collector-emitter voltage drop.</p>
<p>For a load line, one point of data represents the amount of collector-emitter voltage available to the transistor for a given amount of collector current.</p>
<p>The intersection of a characteristic curve and a load line represents the one collector current (and corresponding <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>C</em><em>E</em></sub></span> voltage drop) that will &quot;satisfy&quot; all components’ conditions.</p>
<p>Discuss this question thoroughly with your students. So many students of electronics learn to plot load lines for amplifier circuits without ever really understanding <em>why</em> they must do so. Load line plots are very useful tools in amplifier circuit analysis, but the meaning of each curve/line must be well understood before it becomes useful as an instrument of understanding.</p>
<p>Ask your students which of the two types of graphs (characteristic curves, or load lines) represents a component’s natural, or &quot;free&quot;, behavior, and which one represents the bounded conditions within a particular circuit.</p>
