<p>Explain the purpose of the tank circuit (<span class="math"><em>L</em><sub>1</sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>C</em><sub>1</sub></span>) in the following oscillator circuit, and write an equation describing its operating frequency:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02671x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$f = {1 \over {2 \pi \sqrt{L_1 C_1}}}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Follow-up question: what do you suppose the purpose of the potentiometer is in this oscillator circuit?</p>
<p>Ask your students to describe the amount of phase shift the tank circuit provides to the feedback signal. Also, ask them to explain how the oscillator circuitâ€™s natural frequency may be altered.</p>
<p>Note: potentiometer (voltage gain) adjustment is crucial for obtaining a good-quality sine wave from this type of circuit. If your students decide to build one, they should be aware that some experimentation will be required to get it to output good-quality sine waves!</p>
