<p>The formula for calculating the reluctance (<span class="math">ℜ</span>) of an air-core wire coil (&quot;solenoid&quot;) is as follows:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\Re = {l \over {\mu_0 A}}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Where,</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>l</em></span> = linear length of coil in meters (m)</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>A</em></span> = cross-sectional area of coil &quot;throat&quot; in square meters (m<span class="math">$^{2}$</span>)</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>μ</em><sub>0</sub></span> = permeability of free space = <span class="math">4<em>π</em></span> <span class="math"> × </span> <span class="math">10<sup> − 7</sup></span> (T<span class="math"> ⋅ </span>m/A)</p>
<p>Using this formula and the Rowland’s Law formula, calculate the amount of magnetic flux (<span class="math">Φ </span>) produced in the throat of an air-core solenoid with 250 turns of wire, a length of 0.2 meters, a cross-sectional area of 6.5 <span class="math"> × </span> <span class="math">10<sup> − 4</sup></span> square meters, and a coil current of 5 amps:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03497x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math">Φ </span> = 5.105 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>Wb</p>
<p>With all the information given, this is nothing more than an exercise in calculation. However, it is nice for students to have the air-core solenoid reluctance formula handy for other calculations, which is the main point of this question.</p>
