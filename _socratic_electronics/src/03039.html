<p>Examine the datasheet for a 7447 BCD-to-7-segment decoder/driver IC, and identify what input conditions need to be met in order to cause it to display any decimal digit from 0 to 9.</p>
<p>Iâ€™ll let you figure out these details by researching the datasheet yourself!</p>
<p>Follow-up question: what features differentiate the 7447 decoder/driver IC from the 7448 or 7449? How about the 74247, 74248, and 74249 decoder/driver circuits? Be prepared to show your sources when answering this question in class.</p>
<p>Given that datasheets for this particular decoder/driver IC are easy to obtain and read, your students should have no trouble doing the research.</p>
