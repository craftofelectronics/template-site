<p>When many students first examine cascaded, synchronous flip-flop circuits (where the <span class="math"><em>Q</em></span> output of one enters the input of the next), they wonder why pulses don’t just ripple through the whole chain of flip-flops with one clock pulse. The reason this does not happen is that each flip-flop has a finite amount of <em>set-up time</em> required for the input state to be stable before it is recognized at the active edge of a new clock pulse. Even with instantaneous flip-flop output state changes, the cascaded signal still cannot reach the input of the next flip-flop <em>before</em> the clock pulse arrives at that next flip-flop. Therefore, the fastest a logic state can progress from one flip-flop to another in a synchronous counter circuit is one flip-flop per clock pulse.</p>
