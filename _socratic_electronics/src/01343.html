<p>Imagine a telephone system with only one pair of wires stretching between phone units. For the sake of simplicity, let’s consider each telephone to be a sound-powered (unamplified) unit, where the voltage produced directly by the microphone drives the speaker on the other end:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01343x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>If we were to install a second telephone line to accommodate another pair of people talking to each other, it certainly would work, but it might be expensive to do so because of the cost of wire over the long distance:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01343x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Suppose, though, we installed a set of DPDT switches that switched the two telephone conversations along the same pair of wires (only 1 telephone &quot;line&quot;). This general technique is known as <em>multiplexing</em>. The switches would be synchronized according to clocks at either end of the line, and cycled back and forth repeatedly:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01343x03.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>What would the conversation sound like to either of the listeners if the switch frequency was 1 Hz? What if it was 10 Hz? What if it was 40 kHz?</p>
<p>At 1 Hz, a half-second of each conversation would be missing, every second. The result would be a very &quot;choppy&quot; stream of audio reaching each listener.</p>
<p>At 10 Hz, the &quot;choppiness&quot; would be reduced, with only 1/20 of a second’s worth of conversation missing every 1/10 of a second from each conversation. It would still be very difficult to listen to, though.</p>
<p>At 40 kHz switching speed, both conversations would sound seamless.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: how can we multiplex more than two conversations along the same pair of telephone wires?</p>
<p>Challenge question: is there a limit as to how many conversations we can multiplex on the same wire pair? If so, what parameters would define this limit?</p>
<p>Ask your students why this technique of switching conversations works. How is it possible for audio conversations to sound &quot;seamless&quot; when half the information is missing from each one (regardless of switching speed)?</p>
<p>Ask your students for answers to the challenge question. If no one has any, give them a hint: how does the <em>bandwidth</em> of the telephone lines impact multiplexing a large number of signals?</p>
