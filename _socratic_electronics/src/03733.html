<p>Predict how the operation of this boost converter circuit will be affected as a result of the following faults. Consider each fault independently (i.e. one at a time, no multiple faults):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03733x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Drive circuit fails with a constant &quot;low&quot; (0 volts) output signal:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Drive circuit fails with a constant &quot;high&quot; (+V) output signal:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Diode fails shorted:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Inductor fails open:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Capacitor fails shorted:</p>
<p>For each of these conditions, explain <em>why</em> the resulting effects will occur.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Drive circuit fails with a constant &quot;low&quot; (0 volts) output signal: <em>Output voltage rises to become approximately equal to <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>i</em><em>n</em></sub></span>.</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Drive circuit fails with a constant &quot;high&quot; (+V) output signal: <em>Output voltage falls to zero after capacitor discharges.</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Diode fails shorted: <em>Output voltage exhibits very large &quot;ripple&quot; as the voltage repeatedly falls to zero and spikes back up each drive cycle, transistor may fail due to overheating.</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Inductor fails open: <em>Output voltage falls to zero after capacitor discharges.</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Capacitor fails shorted: <em>Output voltage falls to zero immediately.</em></p>
<p>The purpose of this question is to approach the domain of circuit troubleshooting from a perspective of knowing what the fault is, rather than only knowing what the symptoms are. Although this is not necessarily a realistic perspective, it helps students build the foundational knowledge necessary to diagnose a faulted circuit from empirical data. Questions such as this should be followed (eventually) by other questions asking students to identify likely faults based on measurements.</p>
