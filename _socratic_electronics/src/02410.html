<p>Explain how the one toggle switch is able to switch <em>both</em> transistors on and off simultaneously in this motor control circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02410x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The switch exerts direct control over the lower transistor, which then indirectly turns on the upper transistor. When both transistors are turned on, the motor runs.</p>
<p>This question is really a precursor to analyzing the H-bridge motor drive circuit.</p>
