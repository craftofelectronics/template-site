<p>Common-emitter, common-collector, and common-base amplifier circuits are sometimes referred to as <em>grounded-emitter</em>, <em>grounded-collector</em>, and <em>grounded-base</em>, respectively, because these configurations may actually be built with those respective terminals connected straight to ground.</p>
<p>Although this may not be very practical for ease of biasing, it can be done. Draw the rest of the circuit necessary to provide class-A operation for each of these (partial) transistor circuits. Be sure to show where the DC power source, signal input, and signal output connect:</p>

<p>Although it is more common in modern times to refer to the three BJT amplifier configurations as common-(e, c, b) rather than as <em>grounded</em>-(e, c, b), it may help some students grasp why the word &quot;common&quot; came to be used. &quot;Grounded&quot; makes more literal sense, and seeing these three circuit configurations with directly grounded terminals may serve as a starting point for identifying configurations where the &quot;common&quot; terminals are not directly grounded.</p>
