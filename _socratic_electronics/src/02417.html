<p>D-type MOSFETs are <em>normally-on</em> devices just like junction field-effect transistors, the natural state of their channels being passable to electric currents. Thus, a state of cutoff will only occur on command from an external source.</p>
<p>Explain what must be done to an D-type MOSFET, specifically, to drive it into a state of cutoff (where the channel is fully depleted).</p>
<p>A voltage must be applied between gate and substrate (or gate and source if the substrate is connected to the source terminal) in such a way that the polarity of the gate terminal electrostatically repels the channelâ€™s majority charge carriers.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: unlike JFETs, D-type MOSFETs may be safely &quot;enhanced&quot; beyond the conductivity of their natural state. Describe what is necessary to &quot;command&quot; a D-type MOSFET to conduct better than it naturally does.</p>
<p>This is perhaps the most important question your students could learn to answer when first studying D-type MOSFETs. What, exactly, is necessary to turn one off? Have your students draw diagrams to illustrate their answers as they present in front of the class.</p>
<p>Ask them specifically to identify what polarity of <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>G</em><em>S</em></sub></span> would have to be applied to turn off an N-channel D-type MOSFET, and also a P-channel D-type MOSFET.</p>
