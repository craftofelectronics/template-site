<p>Electronic calculators with logarithm capability have at least two different types of logarithms: <em>common</em> logarithm and <em>natural</em> logarithm, symbolized as &quot;<span class="math">log</span>&quot; and &quot;<span class="math">ln</span>&quot;, respectively. Explain what the difference is between these two types of logarithms.</p>
<p>The common logarithm function assumes a &quot;base&quot; value of ten, whereas the natural logarithm assumes a base value of <span class="math"><em>e</em></span> (Euler’s constant).</p>
<p>Follow-up question: what is the approximate value of <span class="math"><em>e</em></span>? How can you get your calculator to give you the answer (rather than looking it up in a math book?</p>
<p>Some calculators, of course, allow you to extract the logarithm of any number to any base. Here, I simply want students to become familiar with the two logarithm functions available on the most basic scientific calculators.</p>
<p>Note that some calculators will show just enough digits of <span class="math"><em>e</em></span> to give the false impression that they repeat (ten digits: <span class="math"><em>e</em></span> = 2.718281828). If anyone suggests that <span class="math"><em>e</em></span> is a (rational) repeating decimal number, correct this misunderstanding by telling them it is irrational just like <span class="math"><em>π</em></span>.</p>
