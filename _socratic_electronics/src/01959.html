<p>A student is puzzled by a problem given by her instructor. The task is to determine the voltage <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>A</em><em>B</em></sub></span> (defined by the instructor as the voltage indicated by a voltmeter with the red test lead touching point <strong>A</strong> and the black test lead touching point <strong>B</strong>) in this circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01959x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The student has already figured out that <span class="math">$V_A = +9 \hbox{ V}$</span> and <span class="math">$V_B = -6 \hbox{ V}$</span>, but does not know for certain how to calculate the voltage between points <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong>. Asking her instructor for an explanation, the instructor begins to draw this illustration:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01959x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Before the instructor begins to explain what the illustration means, however, he receives a call on his telephone and must leave the student momentarily. The student then asks you to help explain what the instructor’s illustration might mean, and how it applies to the problem of determining voltage <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>A</em><em>B</em></sub></span> in the original circuit.</p>
<p>What would your explanation be? Where do you think the instructor was going with this illustration, and how it might relate to voltages in a circuit?</p>
<p>The height of the cabinet (<em>above</em> ground) represents the <em>positive</em> voltage at point <strong>A</strong>, while the depth of the pit (<em>below</em> ground) represents the <em>negative</em> voltage at point <strong>B</strong>. The <em>difference</em> in altitude between the cabinet’s height and the pit’s depth represents the voltage <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>A</em><em>B</em></sub></span> in the circuit.</p>
<p>It may be good to remind your students that voltage is and forever will be a quantity <em>between two points</em> and never defined at a single point. The only reason we can say <span class="math">$V_A = +9 \hbox{ volts}$</span> and <span class="math">$V_B = -6 \hbox{ volts}$</span> is because there is a <em>ground point</em> in the circuit, which by convention is the point of reference for any voltages defined at other, single points in the circuit.</p>
