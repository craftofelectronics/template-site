<p>Identify the type of oscillator circuit shown in this schematic diagram, and draw the transformer phasing dots in the right places to ensure regenerative feedback:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02633x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Also, write the equation describing the operating frequency of this type of oscillator circuit.</p>
<p>This is an <em>Armstrong</em> oscillator circuit, and the combination of capacitor <span class="math"><em>C</em><sub>3</sub></span> and primary transformer winding inductance <span class="math"><em>L</em><sub>1</sub></span> establishes its frequency of operation.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$f = {1 \over {2 \pi \sqrt{L_1 C_3}}}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02633x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Ask your students to describe the amount of phase shift the transformer-based tank circuit provides to the feedback signal. Having them place phasing dots near the transformer windings is a great review of this topic, and a practical context for winding &quot;polarity&quot;. Also, ask them to explain how the oscillator circuitâ€™s natural frequency may be altered.</p>
