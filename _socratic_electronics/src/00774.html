<p>Explain the difference between a <em>leading</em> power factor and a <em>lagging</em> power factor.</p>
<p>A <em>leading</em> power factor is one created by a predominantly capacitive load, whereas a <em>lagging</em> power factor is one created by a predominantly inductive load.</p>
<p>Ask your students to explain the phase relationships between voltage and current for each of these two conditions: a circuit with a &quot;leading&quot; power factor, and a circuit with a &quot;lagging&quot; power factor. The terms may make a lot more sense once these relationships are seen.</p>
