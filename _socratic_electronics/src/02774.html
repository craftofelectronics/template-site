<p>In ladder logic symbolism, an electromechanical relay coil is shown as a circle, and the contact(s) actuated by the coil as two parallel lines, almost like a capacitor symbol. Given this knowledge, interpret the following ladder logic diagram:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02774x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>How do we know which relay contact is actuated by which relay coil? How does this convention differ from that of standard electrical/electronic schematic diagrams, where the relay coil is shown as an actual coil of wire (inductor symbol) with the contact &quot;linked&quot; to the coil by a dashed line? Also, what type of logic function behavior (AND, OR, NAND, or NOR) does the above circuit exhibit?</p>
<p>In ladder logic diagrams, relay coils are associated with their respective contacts by <em>name</em> rather than by proximity. In this particular circuit, the logic function represented is the AND function.</p>
<p>Many students find it confusing that relay contacts and coils need not be drawn next to one another in a ladder logic diagram, because it is so different from the schematic diagrams they are accustomed to. The non-necessity of proximity in a ladder logic diagram does have its advantages, though! It is simply a matter of getting used to a new way of drawing things.</p>
