<p>Calculate the impedance of a 145 mH inductor connected in series with 750 <span class="math">Ω </span> resistor at a frequency of 1 kHz, then determine the necessary resistor and inductor values to create the exact same total impedance in a <em>parallel</em> configuration.</p>
<p><span class="math">${\bf Z_{total}} =$</span> 1.18 k<span class="math">Ω </span> <span class="math">∠</span> 50.54<span class="math">$^{o}$</span></p>
<p>If connected in parallel: R = 1.857 k<span class="math">Ω </span> ; L = 243.3 mH.</p>
<p>Hint: if you are having difficulty figuring out where to start in answering this question, consider the fact that these two circuits, if equivalent in total impedance, will draw the exact same amount of current from a common AC source at 1 kHz.</p>
<p>This is an interesting question, requiring the student to think creatively about how to convert one configuration of circuit into another, while maintaining the same total effect. As usual, the real purpose of a question like this is to develop problem-solving strategies, rather than to simply obtain an answer.</p>
