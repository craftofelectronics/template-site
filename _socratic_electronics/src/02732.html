<p>Determine both the input and output voltage in this circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02732x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>i</em><em>n</em></sub></span> = -10 V <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>o</em><em>u</em><em>t</em></sub></span> = 24 V</p>
<p>Follow-up question: how do we know that the input voltage in this circuit is negative and the output voltage is positive?</p>
<p>Ask your students how they solved this problem, sharing techniques and strategies to help other students know where to begin and where to proceed from there.</p>
