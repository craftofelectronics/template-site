<p>Diodes and capacitors may be interconnected to form a type of circuit that <em>boosts</em> voltage in the process of rectification. This type of circuit is generally known as a <em>voltage multiplier</em>. Shown here are a few different voltage multiplier circuits:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02011x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Determine the degree of voltage multiplication (double, triple, etc.) provided by each circuit.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02011x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Ask your students how they analyzed each of these voltage multiplier circuits, and to explain their technique(s) to the rest of the class during discussion.</p>
