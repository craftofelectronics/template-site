<p>Explain the operating principle of a <em>single-slope</em> ADC circuit, in your own words.</p>
<p>I wonâ€™t give away all the details here, but the single-slope converter uses an integrator and a binary counter, the binary output determined by how long the counter is allowed to count.</p>
<p>Tutorials abound on simple ADC strategies, so your students should have little problem locating an adequate explanation for the operation of a single-slope ADC.</p>
