<p>Suppose you needed to build a circuit that delayed the energization of a lamp when the button was pushed, and also delayed its turning off when the button was released. In other words, you wanted the lamp to do this:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03135x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Draw a ladder logic diagram for a circuit that would fulfill this function, using at least one time-delay relay.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03135x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Follow-up question: which relay controls the on-delay time, and which relay controls the off-delay time?</p>
<p>This is a good problem-solving exercise, figuring out how to creatively combine time-delay relays to perform a specific function.</p>
