<p>What is an <em>Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor</em> (IGBT), and what advantages does the IGBT provide over both power MOSFET and traditional BJT devices?</p>
<p>The IGBT is a hybrid device, combining the best attributes of MOSFET and BJT in a single component.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: describe some typical applications for the IGBT which make use of these advantages.</p>
<p>The given answer is accurate, yet not very specific. Ask your students to explain exactly what attributes of MOSFET and BJT are exhibited by the IGBT, and why.</p>
