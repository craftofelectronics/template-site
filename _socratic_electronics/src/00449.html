<p>Explain the operation of this &quot;H-bridge&quot; motor control circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00449x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>At any given moment, how many transistors are turned on and how many are turned off? Also, explain what would happen to the function of the circuit if resistor R1 failed open.</p>
<p>Two transistors are on at any given time, and the other two are off. If R1 fails open, the motor will not be able to go in the &quot;forward&quot; (Fwd) direction.</p>
<p>Challenge question: what type of DC motor is this drive circuit designed for? Shunt-wound, series-wound, compound, or permanent magnet? Explain your answer.</p>
<p>The &quot;H-drive&quot; circuit is a very common method of reversing polarity to a DC motor (or other polarity-sensitive load), using only a single-pole switch. Very, very large electric motor &quot;drives&quot; have been based on this same design.</p>
