<p>If an oscilloscope is set up for &quot;single-sweep&quot; triggering and connected to a DC-excited resonant circuit such as the one shown in the following schematic, the resulting oscillation will last just a short time (after momentarily pressing and releasing the pushbutton switch):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03290x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Explain why the oscillations die out, rather than go on forever. Hint: the answer is fundamentally the same as why a swinging pendulum eventually comes to a stop.</p>
<p>No resonant circuit is completely free of dissipative elements, whether resistive or radiative, and so some energy is lost each cycle.</p>
<p>A circuit such as this is easy to build and demonstrate, but you will need a digital storage oscilloscope to successfully capture the damped oscillations. Also, the results may be tainted by switch &quot;bounce,&quot; so be prepared to address that concept if you plan to demonstrate this to a live audience.</p>
<p>You might want to ask your students how they would suggest building a &quot;tank circuit&quot; that is as free from energy losses as possible. If a perfect tank circuit could be built, how would it act if momentarily energized by a DC source such as in this setup?</p>
