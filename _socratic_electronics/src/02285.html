<p>The schematic diagram shown here is for an <em>&quot;inverting&quot; converter circuit</em>, a type of DC-DC &quot;switching&quot; power conversion circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02285x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>In this circuit, the transistor is either fully on or fully off; that is, driven between the extremes of saturation or cutoff. By avoiding the transistor’s &quot;active&quot; mode (where it would drop substantial voltage while conducting current), very low transistor power dissipations can be achieved. With little power wasted in the form of heat, &quot;switching&quot; power conversion circuits are typically very efficient.</p>
<p>Trace all current directions during both states of the transistor. Also, mark the inductor’s voltage polarity during both states of the transistor.</p>

<p>Ask your students why they think this circuit is called an <em>inverting</em> converter.</p>
<p>Although it may not be evident from viewing the circuit schematic, this converter circuit is capable of stepping voltage up <em>or</em> down, making it quite versatile.</p>
