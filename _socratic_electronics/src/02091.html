<p>A parallel AC circuit draws 100 mA of current through a purely resistive branch and 85 mA of current through a purely capacitive branch:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02091x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Calculate the total current and the angle <span class="math">Θ </span> of the total current, explaining your trigonometric method(s) of solution.</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>I</em><sub><em>t</em><em>o</em><em>t</em><em>a</em><em>l</em></sub></span> = 131.2 mA</p>
<p><span class="math">Θ </span> = 40.36<span class="math">$^{o}$</span></p>
<p>Follow-up question: in calculating <span class="math">Θ </span>, it is recommended to use the arctangent function instead of either the arcsine or arc-cosine functions. The reason for doing this is accuracy: less possibility of compounded error, due to either rounding and/or calculator-related (keystroke) errors. Explain why the use of the arctangent function to calculate <span class="math">Θ </span> incurs less chance of error than either of the other two arcfunctions.</p>
<p>The follow-up question illustrates an important principle in many different disciplines: avoidance of unnecessary risk by choosing calculation techniques using given quantities instead of derived quantities. This is a good topic to discuss with your students, so make sure you do so.</p>
