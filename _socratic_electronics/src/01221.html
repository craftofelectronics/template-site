<p>In order to familiarize students with these &quot;strange&quot; numeration systems, I like to begin each day of digital circuit instruction with counting practice. Students need to be <em>fluent</em> in these numeration systems by the time they are finished studying digital circuits!</p>
<p>One suggestion I give to students to help them see patterns in the count sequences is &quot;pad&quot; the numbers with leading zeroes so that all numbers have the same number of characters. For example, instead of writing &quot;10&quot; for the binary number two, write &quot;00010&quot;. This way, the patterns of character cycling (especially binary, where each successively higher-valued bit has half the frequency of the one before it) become more evident to see.</p>
