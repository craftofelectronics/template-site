<p>You may use circuit simulation software to set up similar oscilloscope display interpretation scenarios, for practice or for verification of what you see in this exercise.</p>
<p>Use a sine-wave function generator for the AC voltage source, and be sure set the frequency to some reasonable value (well within the capability of both the oscilloscope and counter to measure).</p>
<p>Some digital oscilloscopes have &quot;auto set&quot; controls which automatically set the vertical, horizontal, and triggering controls to &quot;lock in&quot; a waveform. Be sure students are learning how to set up these controls on their own rather than just pushing the &quot;auto set&quot; button!</p>
