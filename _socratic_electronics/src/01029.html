<p>Explain the operating principle of a <em>photovoltaic cell</em>, otherwise known as a &quot;solar cell.&quot; What happens within these devices to convert sunlight directly into electricity?</p>
<p>The energy of photons (light &quot;particles&quot;) striking a PN semiconductor junction creates electron-hole pairs, which then move in the direction that the depletion regionâ€™s electric field pushes them.</p>
<p>Challenge question: of what significance is the <em>band gap</em> of the PN junction to the efficiency of the cell?</p>
<p>There is quite a bit of detail that could be added to the account given in the answer. Ask your students to supply some of this detail! There are many resources for learning how photovoltaic cells work, so your students should have no trouble finding the information on their own.</p>
