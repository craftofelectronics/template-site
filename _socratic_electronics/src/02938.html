<p>A student has an idea to make a J-K flip-flop toggle: why not just connect the <span class="math"><em>J</em></span>, <span class="math"><em>K</em></span>, and Clock inputs together and drive them all with the same square-wave pulse? If the inputs are active-high and the clock is positive edge-triggered, the <span class="math"><em>J</em></span> and <span class="math"><em>K</em></span> inputs should both go &quot;high&quot; at the same moment the clock signal transitions from low to high, thus establishing the necessary conditions for a toggle (<span class="math"><em>J</em></span>=1, <span class="math"><em>K</em></span>=1, clock transition):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02938x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Unfortunately, the J-K flip-flop refuses to toggle when this circuit is built. No matter how many clock pulses it receives, the <span class="math"><em>Q</em></span> and <span class="math">$\overline{Q}$</span> outputs remain in their original states – the flip-flop remains &quot;latched.&quot; Explain the practical reason why the student’s flip-flop circuit idea will not work.</p>
<p>With all inputs tied together, there is zero setup time on the <span class="math"><em>J</em></span> and <span class="math"><em>K</em></span> inputs before the clock pulse rises.</p>
<p>The purpose of this question is to get students to think about setup time, and to see its importance by providing a scenario where the circuit will not work because this parameter has been ignored.</p>
