<p>Describe what happens to the capacitor voltage in this circuit over time as it is charged by the constant-current source:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01895x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Now, determine the ideal values for <span class="math"><em>V</em></span> and <span class="math"><em>R</em></span> that will result in similar behavior in a capacitor circuit powered by a <em>voltage source</em> rather than a current source:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01895x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Your answers will, of course, be qualitative rather than quantitative. Explain whether or not the time constant for the voltage-source-powered circuit ought to be large or small, and why.</p>
<p>Both <span class="math"><em>V</em></span> and <span class="math"><em>R</em></span> should be extremely large values in order to mimic the behavior of a current source.</p>
<p>In this question, I ask students to identify the behavior of a true integrator circuit, and then contrast it with the behavior of what is more accurately known as a first-order lag circuit (the RC circuit powered by the voltage source). Of course, the two circuits do not behave the same, but through judicious choices of <span class="math"><em>V</em></span> and <span class="math"><em>C</em></span>, one can make the &quot;lag&quot; circuit closely mimic the true integrator circuit over a practical range of capacitor voltage.</p>
