<p>Compare the voltage gains of these two opamp circuits:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00700x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Which one has the greater <span class="math"><em>A</em><sub><em>V</em></sub></span>, and why?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00700x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>This opamp circuit has the greater voltage gain, because its <span class="math">$Z_{feedback} \over Z_{input}$</span> ratio is greater.</p>
<p>It is common to see impedances represented as boxes, if their constituent components are not germane to the operation of the circuit.</p>
