<p>Calculate the amount of electric current that would have to pass through a coil of wire having 850 turns to produce an MMF (<span class="math">$\cal F$</span>) of 2.1 amp-turns.</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>I</em></span> = 2.471 mA</p>
<p>Nothing special here, just a simple calculation. One of the points of this question is to have students research the formula for calculating <span class="math">$\cal F$</span>, as simple as it is.</p>
