<p>Using a computer or graphing calculator, plot the sum of these two sine waves:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01557x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>What do you suppose the sum of a 1-volt (peak) sine wave and a 2-volt (peak) sine wave will be, if both waves are perfectly in-phase with each other?</p>
<p>Hint: you will need to enter equations into your plotting device that look something like this:</p>
<p>y1 = sin x</p>
<p>y2 = 2 * sin x</p>
<p>y3 = y1 + y2</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01557x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Graphing calculators are excellent tools to use for learning experiences such as this. In far less time than it would take to plot a third sine wave by hand, students may see the sinusoidal sum for themselves.</p>
