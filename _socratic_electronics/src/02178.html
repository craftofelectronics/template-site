<p>The three different types of power in AC circuits are as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> S = apparent power, measured in Volt-Amps (VA)</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> P = true power, measured in Watts (W)</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Q = reactive power, measured in Volt-Amps reactive (VAR)</p>
<p>Explain the names of each of these power types. Why are they called &quot;apparent,&quot; &quot;true,&quot; and &quot;reactive&quot;?</p>
<p>&quot;Apparent&quot; power is <em>apparently</em> the total circuit power when volts and amps are multiplied together. &quot;Reactive&quot; power is due to reactive components (<span class="math"><em>L</em></span> and <span class="math"><em>C</em></span>) only, and &quot;True&quot; power is the only type that actually accounts for energy leaving the circuit through a load component.</p>
<p>These definitions may be found in any number of textbooks, but that does not mean they are easy to understand. Be sure to discuss these very important concepts with your students, given their tendency to generate confusion!</p>
