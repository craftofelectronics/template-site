<p>Complete the timing diagram, showing the state of the <span class="math"><em>Q</em></span> output over time as the input switches are actuated. Assume that <span class="math"><em>Q</em></span> begins in the low state on power-up:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02901x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02901x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Follow-up question: complete a schematic diagram showing how this latch circuit could turn a motor on and off through a MOSFET.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02901x03.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Also, comment on whether your MOSFET <em>sources</em> current to the motor or <em>sinks</em> current from the motor.</p>
<p>Some students may be confused about the width of the last pulse on the <span class="math"><em>Q</em></span> output. Remind them that <span class="math"><em>Q</em></span> follows <span class="math"><em>D</em></span> for as long as the Enable input is activated!</p>
