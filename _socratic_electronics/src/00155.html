<p>What naturally occurring substance is the <em>best</em> conductor of electricity?</p>
<p>Most people think the answer to this question is <em>gold</em>. However, there is another type of metal that conducts electricity better than any other type of metal, including gold! Document where you found your answer to this question.</p>
<p>A few of your students may come across <em>superconductors</em> in their research, which of course conduct electricity perfectly (with no resistance to electric current whatsoever). However, the answer Iâ€™m looking for here is the non-superconducting metal with the lowest electrical resistance of all.</p>
