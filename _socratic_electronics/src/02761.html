<p>Identify the type of logic gate shown in this schematic diagram, and explain why it has the name it does:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02761x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>This is an <strong>inverter</strong> gate, so named because its output is always the opposite (inverted) state as the input.</p>
<p>Note: inverter gates are often shown like this instead:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02761x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Note: inverter gates are sometimes referred to as <strong>NOT</strong> gates, because when the input is high, the output will <em>not</em> be high.</p>
<p>Your students should have no great difficulty identifying this particular logic gate if they have a good digital electronics reference book at their disposal.</p>
