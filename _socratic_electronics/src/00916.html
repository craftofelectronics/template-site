<p><em>Series-wound</em> DC motors have very different operating characteristics than either shunt-wound or permanent magnet DC motors. Describe what happens in a series-wound motor when a mechanical load is placed on the motor, causing it to slow down and the counter-EMF to decrease:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00916x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Contrast this behavior against that of a permanent magnet DC motor under the same conditions (increased mechanical load, causing counter-EMF to decrease).</p>
<p>As a series-wound motor is slowed down by a mechanical load, its field strength increases, causing the torque to increase dramatically.</p>
<p>Ask your students to contrast this motor behavior against that of a permanent magnet or shunt-wound motor. What happens to the stationary magnetic field strengths in those motor types when mechanically loaded? Ask your students what applications might be best for series motors, and what applications might be best for shunt or permanent magnet motors.</p>
