<p>Shown here is a simple telegraph circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00920x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Explain why the lamps energize when either pushbutton is actuated, and why they de-energize when both pushbuttons are open (despite there being an unbroken circuit connecting both lamps and both batteries).</p>
<p>The key to understanding this circuit is that both batteries are equal in voltage and opposed in polarity to one another.</p>
<p>This is a simple circuit, yet practical in its function as a telegraph and as an example of KVL in action.</p>
