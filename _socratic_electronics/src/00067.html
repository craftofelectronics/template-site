<p>Examine this schematic diagram:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00067x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Now, without moving the following components, show how they may be connected together with wires to form the same circuit depicted in the schematic diagram above:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00067x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00067x03.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>One of the more difficult skills for students to develop is the ability to translate a nice, neat schematic diagram into a messy, real-world circuit, and visa-versa. Developing this skill requires lots of practice.</p>
<p>It is very worthwhile for students to discuss how they solve problems such as these with each other. For those students who have trouble visualizing shapes, a simple hint or &quot;trick&quot; to use when translating schematics to illustrations or visa-versa may be invaluable.</p>
