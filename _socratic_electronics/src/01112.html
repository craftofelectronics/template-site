<p>The simplest form of AM radio receiver is the so-called <em>crystal</em> receiver circuit. It gets its name from the very early days of solid-state electronics, when crude signal rectifying diodes were constructed from certain types of mineral crystals:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01112x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Explain how the AM radio signal becomes &quot;demodulated&quot; into an audio-frequency signal, through the clipping action of the diode.</p>
<p>This simple AM &quot;detector&quot; circuit is widely discussed in basic electronics textbooks and other technical literature. There is little I can say here that would expand on what is already written about these circuits. I leave it to you to do the research!</p>
<p>Ask your students to explain the purpose of each component in the &quot;crystal&quot; radio circuit, not just those components related to the clipping function.</p>
