<p>What is <em>common-mode voltage</em>, and how should a differential amplifier (ideally) respond to it?</p>
<p>&quot;Common-mode voltage&quot; is the amount of voltage common to both inputs of a differential amplifier. Ideally, a differential amplifier should <em>reject</em> this common-mode voltage, only amplifying the difference between the two input voltages.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: what does the phrase <em>common-mode rejection ratio</em> (CMRR) mean for a differential amplifier?</p>
<p>Ask your students to provide examples of common-mode voltage to a differential amplifier. For example, <span class="math"><em>x</em></span> amount of voltage on one input and <span class="math"><em>y</em></span> amount of voltage on the other constitutes <span class="math"><em>z</em></span> amount of common-mode voltage . . .</p>
