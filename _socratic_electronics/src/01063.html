<p>Suppose you needed to build a simple voltage regulator circuit with a regulation point of 4.5 volts, but had no zener diodes to work with. Can you think of a way normal diodes could be used for the purpose instead?</p>

<p>(The number of series-connected diodes required depends on the actual forward voltage drop of each diode under loaded conditions.)</p>
<p>Some students may suggest to use normal diodes backwards, exploiting the reverse-breakdown phenomenon common to all PN junctions. Whether or not this suggestion is made, ask your students why it would not be a practical solution in this case.</p>
