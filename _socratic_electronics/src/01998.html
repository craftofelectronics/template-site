<p>Use circuit simulation software to verify your predicted and measured parameter values.</p>
<p>Use a power transistor for this circuit, as general-purpose signal transistors may not have sufficient power dissipation ratings to survive the loading students may put them through! I recommend a small DC motor as a load. An electric motor offers an easy way to increase electrical loading by placing a mechanical load on the shaft. By doing this, students can see for themselves how well the circuit maintains load voltage (resisting voltage &quot;sag&quot; under increasing load current).</p>
<p>I have found that this circuit is excellent for getting students to understand how negative feedback really works. Here, the opamp adjusts the power transistor’s base voltage to <em>whatever it needs to be</em> in order to maintain the load voltage at the same level as the reference set by the zener diode. Any sort of loss incurred by the transistor (most notably <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>B</em><em>E</em></sub></span>) is automatically compensated for by the opamp.</p>
<p>An extension of this exercise is to incorporate troubleshooting questions. Whether using this exercise as a performance assessment or simply as a concept-building lab, you might want to follow up your students’ results by asking them to predict the consequences of certain circuit faults.</p>
