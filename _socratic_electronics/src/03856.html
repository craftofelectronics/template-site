<p>Explain what the <em>characteristic curve</em> for a transistor shows. In other words, what important parameters or behaviors of the transistor are shown on a characteristic curve plot?</p>
<p>A &quot;characteristic curve&quot; shows how the transistor acts as a current-regulating device over a range of supply voltages. It also shows where the transistor saturates, and where it may break down.</p>
