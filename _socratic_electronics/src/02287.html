<p>The <em>voltage gain</em> of a single-ended amplifier is defined as the ratio of output voltage to input voltage:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02287x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$A_V = {V_{out} \over V_{in}}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Often voltage gain is defined more specifically as the ratio of output voltage change to input voltage change. This is generally known as the <em>AC</em> voltage gain of an amplifier:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$A_{V(AC)} = {{\Delta V_{out}} \over {\Delta V_{in}}}$</span><br /></p>
<p>In either case, though, gain is a ratio of a single output voltage to a single input voltage.</p>
<p>How then do we generally define the voltage gain of a <em>differential</em> amplifier, where there are two inputs, not just one?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02287x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Voltage gain for a differential amplifier is defined as the ratio of output voltage to the <em>difference</em> in voltage between the two inputs.</p>
<p>This is a very important concept for students to grasp, especially before they proceed to study operational amplifiers, which are nothing more than differential amplifiers with extremely high voltage gains.</p>
