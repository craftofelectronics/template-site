<p>A block diagram of a <em>phase-locked loop</em> circuit looks like this:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01143x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Determine what type of electronic signals would be seen at points A and B for the following input conditions:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Input = sine wave, steady frequency</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Input = sine wave, increasing frequency</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Input = sine wave, decreasing frequency</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Input = sine wave, frequency increases and decreases regularly</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Input = sine wave, steady frequency</p>
<p>– <strong>A</strong>: Steady DC voltage</p>
<p>– <strong>B</strong>: frequency equal to input signal</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Input = sine wave, increasing frequency</p>
<p>– <strong>A</strong>: Increasing DC voltage</p>
<p>– <strong>B</strong>: frequency equal to input signal</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Input = sine wave, decreasing frequency</p>
<p>– <strong>A</strong>: Decreasing DC voltage</p>
<p>– <strong>B</strong>: frequency equal to input signal</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Input = sine wave, frequency increases and decreases regularly</p>
<p>– <strong>A</strong>: DC voltage that rises and falls with input frequency</p>
<p>– <strong>B</strong>: frequency equal to input signal</p>
<p>The purpose of this question is to get students to recognize the function of each &quot;block&quot; in a phase-locked loop. Having them predict the types of output signals at points A and B for different input signal conditions reveals whether or not they understand the concept.</p>
<p>Ask them where they obtained their information on phase-locked loop operation. I’ve seen quite a few tutorials on the internet for this subject, so there should be no problem with students finding sources.</p>
