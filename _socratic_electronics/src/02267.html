<p>No ground symbols are seen anywhere in the schematic diagram, yet there are &quot;+V&quot; and &quot;-V&quot; labels for the two poles of the DC power supply. Where is ground in this circuit, and what establishes its potential?</p>
<p>The voltage divider circuit comprised of two 1 k<span class="math">Ω </span> resistors establishes the ground point.</p>
<p>Of course, this circuit could have been built with a &quot;split&quot; supply of +V/Gnd/-V, but it is much easier to find or build a simple &quot;single&quot; power supply!</p>
