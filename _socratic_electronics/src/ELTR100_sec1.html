<p>A common misunderstanding is that the location of a break (interruption) in a simple circuit matters to the electrons moving around in it. To the contrary, <em>any</em> break in a simple circuit halts the flow of electrons <em>everywhere</em> in it. A good way to grasp this concept is by experimenting with a simple one-battery, one-lamp circuit, seeing the effect that breaks in the circuit have on the lamp’s illumination.</p>
<p>Unlike current, which may be measured at a single point in a circuit, voltage is fundamentally relative: it only exists as a <em>difference</em> between two points. In other words, there is no such thing as voltage existing at a single location. Therefore, while we speak of current going <em>through</em> a component in a circuit, we speak of voltage being <em>across</em> a component, measured between two different points on that component. So confusing is this concept that a significant number of students continue to harbor conceptual errors about the nature of voltage for several months after having first learned about it. A good way to understand voltage is to experiment with a voltmeter, measuring voltage between different pairs of points in safe, low-voltage circuits. Another good way to gain proficiency is to practice on conceptual problems relating to the measurement of voltage in circuits.</p>
<p>It is common for students uncomfortable with algebra to resort to &quot;cheat&quot; techniques to figure out how to write the various equations for Ohm’s and Joule’s Law (e.g. drawing the letters in a pyramid shape and then covering up the one you want to solve for to see where the others are in relation to each other; or using a &quot;cheat sheet&quot; showing all algebraic combinations of V, I, R, and P). The real problem is lack of math skill, and the only solution is to gain proficiency by <em>using</em> algebra to transpose variables in these equations. Ohm’s Law is the easiest equation you will see in electronics for practicing your algebra skills, so use this as an opportunity to learn!</p>
