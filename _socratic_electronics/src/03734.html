<p>This crowbar circuit has a problem. It used to work just fine, and then one day it blew the fuse. Upon replacing the fuse, the new fuse immediately blew:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03734x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Measuring the supply voltage with a voltmeter, everything checks out well. There does not appear to be an overvoltage condition causing a legitimate &quot;crowbar&quot; event in the circuit. Disconnecting the load from the crowbar circuit and powering it up with a standard bench-top laboratory power supply reveals the load to be in perfect condition. Thus, both the source and the load have been eliminated as possibilities that may have blown the fuse(s).</p>
<p>Moving on to the crowbar circuit itself, identify some component faults that could (each, independently) account for the problem, and explain your reasoning.</p>
<p>(not an exhaustive list)</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> SCR failed shorted</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Zener diode failed shorted</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> failed shorted</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span> failed open</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>4</sub></span> failed open (especially if SCR is a sensitive-gate type)</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> UJT <span class="math"><em>Q</em><sub>1</sub></span> failed shorted between base terminals</p>
<p>Discuss with your students the initial troubleshooting steps described in the question. What strategy or strategies is the technician taking to isolate the problem?</p>
