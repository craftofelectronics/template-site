<p>Describe what happens to <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>o</em><em>u</em><em>t</em></sub></span> (the voltage across capacitor <span class="math"><em>C</em><sub>4</sub></span>) as time goes on, assuming the relay is continuously toggled by the oscillator circuit at a high frequency. Assume that the input voltage (<span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>i</em><em>n</em></sub></span>) is constant over time:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01455x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>This type of circuit is often referred to as a <em>flying capacitor</em> circuit, with <span class="math"><em>C</em><sub>3</sub></span> being the &quot;flying&quot; capacitor. Explain why this is, and what possible benefit might be realized by using a flying capacitor circuit to sample a voltage.</p>
<p><em>Flying capacitor</em> circuits are used to provide galvanic isolation between a sampled voltage source and voltage measurement circuitry.</p>
<p>I once worked for a company where thousands of these &quot;flying capacitor&quot; circuits were used to sample voltage across numerous series-connected electrochemical reduction cells, whose common-mode voltage could easily exceed 500 volts DC! This primitive technology provided isolation so that the data acquisition circuitry did not have to deal with that high common-mode voltage.</p>
<p>Incidentally, the relays we used were hermetically sealed, mercury-wetted contact, reed relays. These relays had a surprisingly long life, often several years! They were cycled at around 20 Hz, for several cycles, about once every minute (24 hours per day, 365 days per year).</p>
