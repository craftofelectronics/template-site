<p>Suppose you are working on the power wiring inside of a home, and are wondering whether or not the home is supplied with 3-phase or single-phase power. You do not have a voltmeter available to measure voltage, but you do have plenty of light bulbs, switches, wires, and other standard residential wiring components available for use.</p>
<p>The two possibilities for this home’s power source are shown here, the coils representing secondary windings of the utility power transformer:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00413x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>An experienced electrician suggests you build the following circuit to test whether or not the home’s power is supplied by a 3-phase source or a single-phase source:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00413x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The electrician tells you to open and close the switch, and observe the brightness of the light bulbs. This will indicate whether or not the system is 3-phase.</p>
<p>Explain how this circuit works. What sort of light bulb behavior would indicate a 3-phase source? What sort of light bulb behavior would indicate a single-phase source?</p>
<p>On a single-phase system, there should be no change in light bulb brightness as the switch is opened and closed. On a three-phase system, there will be a change in brightness between the two different switch states (I’ll let you figure out which switch state makes the light bulbs glow brighter!).</p>
<p>The subject of this question is closely related to the subject of &quot;single-phasing&quot; a polyphase load as the result of a line conductor opening. In this case it is the neutral conductor we are intentionally opening, but the results are similar.</p>
