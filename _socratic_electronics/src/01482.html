<p>The &quot;Miller capacitance&quot; of a transistor in a common-emitter configuration is often expressed as the product of the transistor’s base-to-collector junction capacitance (<span class="math"><em>C</em><sub><em>B</em><em>C</em></sub></span>) and <span class="math"><em>β</em> + 1</span>:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math"><em>C</em><sub><em>m</em><em>i</em><em>l</em><em>l</em><em>e</em><em>r</em></sub> = <em>C</em><sub><em>B</em><em>C</em></sub>(<em>β</em> + 1)</span><br /></p>
<p>Why is this? What purpose does it serve to include the transistor’s gain into the calculation, rather than just expressing the junction capacitance as it is?</p>
<p>Since <span class="math"><em>C</em><sub><em>B</em><em>C</em></sub></span> &quot;couples&quot; the collector to the base, changes in collector voltage result in far more collector current than would result from <span class="math"><em>C</em><sub><em>B</em><em>C</em></sub></span> coupling to ground. In other words, the transistor’s gain effectively multiplies the Miller-effect capacitance as &quot;seen&quot; from the collector terminal to ground:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$i_C \approx C_{BC}\left( \beta + 1 \right){dV_C \over dt} &gt;&gt; C_{BC}{dV_C \over dt}$</span><br /></p>
<p>This effect of base-collector capacitance &quot;multiplication,&quot; while being a nuisance in typical amplifier applications, may be exploited for positive benefit in other circuits. Many an op-amp circuit has been built specifically to &quot;multiply&quot; the value of a passive component, when some exceptionally large value is needed that will not fit on a circuit board. This technique has its limits, of course, but is good to keep in mind.</p>
<p>Some students may not be familiar with the double-chevron notation (<span class="math"> &gt;  &gt; </span> or <span class="math"> &lt;  &lt; </span>). It means <em>much greater than</em>, and <em>much less than</em>, respectively.</p>
