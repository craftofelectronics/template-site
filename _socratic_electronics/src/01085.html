<p>Under certain conditions (especially with certain types of loads) it is possible for a simple one-transistor voltage amplifier circuit to oscillate:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01085x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Explain how this is possible. What parasitic effects could possibly turn an amplifier into an oscillator?</p>
<p>Here is a re-drawn representation of the amplifier circuit, with the base-emitter capacitance shown:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01085x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Follow-up question: what type of oscillator circuit does this resemble?</p>
<p>Challenge question: what type(s) of load would tend to make this circuit oscillate more readily than others?</p>
<p>This question reinforces a very important lesson in electronic circuit design: parasitic effects may produce some <em>very</em> unexpected consequences! Just because you didn’t intend for your amplifier circuit to oscillate does not mean than it won’t.</p>
