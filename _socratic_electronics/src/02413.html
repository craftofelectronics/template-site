<p>Identify each type of JFET (whether it is N-channel or P-channel), label the terminals, and determine whether the JFET in each of these circuits will be turned <em>on</em> or <em>off</em>:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02413x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Additionally, identify which of these four circuits places unnecessary stress on the transistor. There is one circuit among these four where the transistor is operated in a state that might lead to premature failure.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02413x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The upper-right circuit places unnecessary stress on the JFET.</p>
<p>It is very important for your students to understand what factor(s) in a circuit force a JFET to turn on or off. Be sure to ask your students to explain their reasoning for each transistor’s status. What factor, or combination of factors, is necessary to turn a JFET on, versus off? One point of this question is to emphasize the non-importance of <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>D</em><em>D</em></sub></span>’s polarity when there is an external biasing voltage applied directly between gate and source.</p>
<p>Discuss with your students precisely what is wrong with the upper-right JFET circuit. Why is the transistor being stressed? How do we avoid such a problem?</p>
