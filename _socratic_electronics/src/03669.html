<p>This passive integrator circuit is powered by a square-wave voltage source (oscillating between 0 volts and 5 volts at a frequency of 2 kHz). Determine the output voltage (<span class="math"><em>v</em><sub><em>o</em><em>u</em><em>t</em></sub></span>) of the integrator at each instant in time where the square wave transitions (goes from 0 to 5 volts, or from 5 to 0 volts), assuming that the capacitor begins in a fully discharged state at the first transition (from 0 volts to 5 volts):</p>

<p>Challenge question: what are the final (ultimate) values for the integrator outputâ€™s sawtooth-wave peak voltages?</p>
<p>Be sure to have your students share their problem-solving techniques (how they determined which equation to use, etc.) in class. See how many of them notice that the exponential portion of the equation (<span class="math">$e^{t \over \tau}$</span>) is the same for each calculation, and if they find an easy way to manage the calculations by storing charge/discharge percentages in their calculator memories!</p>
