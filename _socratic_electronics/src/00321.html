<p>What is a <em>polarized</em> power plug, and what does this have to do with electrical safety?</p>
<p>A &quot;polarized&quot; power plug is one that is designed to plug into a power receptacle one way only (i.e. it cannot be reversed). Usually this is accomplished by the use of one &quot;prong&quot; on the plug being wider than the other, with matching-width holes in the receptacle.</p>
<p>Discuss with your students the relative merits of polarized plugs versus three-wire plugs that provide a hard ground connection with the frame of the electrical device. Which plug type provides a greater level of safety? Why?</p>
