<p>Identify some different ways you can create the sine-wave audio tracks necessary to turn the media player into a signal generator.</p>
<p>Some computer programs will generate &quot;wave&quot; files (.wav) according to the wave-shape, amplitude, and frequency specified. Using a program such as this is one of the best ways to obtain the necessary audio tracks.</p>
<p>There are other ways to obtain good audio tracks, including recording the output of another signal generator. I have had such good success with the computer method, though, I can’t imagine that recording an analog source – no matter how good that source may be – would do much better.</p>
<p>Incidentally, the program I use is a Linux application called sox. It is a general-purpose sound file converter utility that also happens to have a &quot;synthesizer&quot; mode where it can generate audio tracks. Using this utility, I created twenty sine-wave tracks and then burnt them to a CD-R, where I could then play the tracks using a cheap ($17.00, 2004 U.S. currency) CD-audio player. I found the best wave quality to be when the player’s &quot;anti-skip&quot; mode was turned <em>off</em>.</p>
