<p>A submarine sonar system uses a &quot;bank&quot; of parallel-connected capacitors to store the electrical energy needed to send brief, powerful pulses of current to a transducer (a &quot;speaker&quot; of sorts). This generates powerful sound waves in the water, which are then used for echo-location. The capacitor bank relieves the electrical generators and power distribution wiring aboard the submarine from having to be rated for huge surge currents. The generator trickle-charges the capacitor bank, and then the capacitor bank quickly dumps its store of energy to the transducer when needed:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03119x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>As you might well imagine, such a capacitor bank can be lethal, as the voltages involved are quite high and the surge current capacity is enormous. Even when the DC generator is disconnected (using the &quot;toggle&quot; disconnect switch shown in the schematic), the capacitors may hold their lethal charge for many days.</p>
<p>To help decreases the safety risk for technical personnel working on this system, a &quot;discharge&quot; switch is connected in parallel with the capacitor bank to automatically provide a path for discharge current whenever the generator disconnect switch is opened:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03119x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Suppose the capacitor bank consists of forty 1500 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>F capacitors connected in parallel (I know the schematic only shows three, but . . .), and the discharge resistor is 10 k<span class="math">Ω </span> in size. Calculate the amount of time it takes for the capacitor bank to discharge to 10 percent of its original voltage and the amount of time it takes to discharge to 1 percent of its original voltage once the disconnect switch opens and the discharge switch closes.</p>
<p>Time to reach 10% <span class="math"> ≈ </span> 23 minutes</p>
<p>Time to reach 1% <span class="math"> ≈ </span> 46 minutes</p>
<p>Follow-up question: without using the time constant formula again, calculate how long it will take to discharge to 0.1% of its original voltage. How about 0.01%?</p>
<p>The follow-up question illustrates an important mathematical principle regarding logarithmic decay functions: for every passing of a fixed time interval, the system decays by the same <em>factor</em>. This is most clearly (and popularly) seen in the concept of <em>half-life</em> for radioactive substances, but it is also seen here for RC (or LR) circuits.</p>
