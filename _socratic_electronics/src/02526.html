<p>The following circuit is known as an <em>instrumentation amplifier</em>:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02526x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Suppose a DC voltage were to be applied to the noninverting input terminal, +1 volt at <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>i</em><em>n</em>( + )</sub></span>, and the inverting input terminal grounded. Complete the following table showing the output voltage of this circuit for different values of <span class="math"><em>m</em></span>:</p>
<p><span class="math"></span><br /><span class="math">$\underbar{file 02526}$</span><br /><br /><span class="math"></span><br />A<sub>V(diff)</sub> = 2 + m m<span class="math"></span></p>
<p>Follow-up question: why did I choose to set the noninverting input voltage at +1 volts and ground the inverting input? Should we not be able to calculate gain given <em>any</em> two input voltages and a value for <span class="math"><em>m</em></span>? Explain the purpose behind my choice of input voltage conditions for this &quot;thought experiment.&quot;</p>
<p>While the relationship between instrumentation amplifier differential gain and <span class="math"><em>m</em></span> may be looked up in any good opamp circuit textbook, it is something that your students should learn to figure out on their own from the data in the table.</p>
