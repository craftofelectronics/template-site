<p>Identify what type of filter this circuit is, and calculate the size of resistor necessary to give it a cutoff frequency of 3 kHz:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00619x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>This is a <em>high-pass</em> filter.</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>R</em> = 2<em>π</em><em>f</em><em>L</em></span></p>
<p><span class="math"><em>R</em> = </span> 5.65 k<span class="math">Ω </span></p>
<p>The most important part of this question, as usual, is to have students come up with methods of solution for determining R’s value. Ask them to explain how they arrived at their answer, and if their method of solution made use of any formula or principle used in <em>capacitive</em> filter circuits.</p>
