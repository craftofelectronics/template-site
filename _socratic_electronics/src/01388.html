<p>Counter circuits built by cascading the output of one flip-flop to the clock input of the next flip-flop are generally referred to as <em>ripple</em> counters. Explain why this is so. What happens in such a circuit that earns it the label of &quot;ripple&quot;? Is this effect potentially troublesome in circuit operation, or is it something of little or no consequence?</p>
<p>When these counters increment or decrement, they do so in such a way that the respective output bits change state in rapid sequence (&quot;rippling&quot;) rather than all at the same time. This creates false count outputs for very brief moments of time.</p>
<p>Whether or not this constitutes a problem in a digital circuit depends on the circuitâ€™s tolerance of false counts. In many circuits, there are ways to avoid this problem without resorting to a re-design of the counter.</p>
<p>If your students have studied binary adder circuits, they should recognize the term &quot;ripple&quot; in a slightly different context. Different circuit, same problem.</p>
