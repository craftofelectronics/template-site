<p>A student built this resistor circuit on a solderless breadboard, but made a mistake positioning resistor R3. It should be located one hole to the left instead of where it is right now:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01770x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Determine what the voltage drop will be across each resistor, in this faulty configuration, assuming that the battery outputs 9 volts.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math">$R_1 = 2 \hbox{ k} \Omega$</span> <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>R</em>1</sub> = </span></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math">$R_2 = 1 \hbox{ k} \Omega$</span> <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>R</em>2</sub> = </span></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math">$R_3 = 3.3 \hbox{ k} \Omega$</span> <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>R</em>3</sub> = </span></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math">$R_4 = 4.7 \hbox{ k} \Omega$</span> <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>R</em>4</sub> = </span></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math">$R_5 = 4.7 \hbox{ k} \Omega$</span> <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>R</em>5</sub> = </span></p>
<p>Rather than tell you each voltage drop, I’ll give you this one hint: there is only <em>one</em> resistor in this breadboard circuit that has voltage across it! All the other resistors in this circuit are de-energized, thanks to the misplacement of resistor R3.</p>
<p>Tell your students that the fault shown in this question is quite typical. The hole spacings on solderless breadboards are small enough that it is surprisingly easy to mis-locate a component in the manner shown.</p>
<p>Point out to your students (if they haven’t already noticed) that no calculations are necessary to answer this question! It may be answered through simple, qualitative analysis alone.</p>
