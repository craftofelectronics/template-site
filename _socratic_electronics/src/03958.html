<p>Suppose that an operational amplifier has a gain-bandwidth product of 1.5 MHz. How much gain could I obtain in a voltage amplifier circuit using this op-amp and still be able to amplify signals up to 100 kHz in frequency before it starts &quot;cutting off&quot; like a low-pass filter? Is this gain a maximum or a minimum value to consider?</p>
