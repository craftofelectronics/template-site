<p>Many different equations used in the analysis of electric circuits may be graphed. Take for instance Ohm’s Law for a 1 k<span class="math">Ω </span> resistor:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03059x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Plot this graph, following Ohm’s Law. Then, plot another graph representing the voltage/current relationship of a 2 k<span class="math">Ω </span> resistor.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03059x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Ask your students to explain how they plotted the two functions. Did they make a table of values first? Did they draw dots on the paper and then connect those dots with a line? Did anyone plot dots for the endpoints and then draw a straight line in between because they knew this was a linear function?</p>
