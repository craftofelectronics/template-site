<p>A simple AC-DC power supply circuit outputs about 6.1 volts DC without a filter capacitor connected, and about 9.3 volts DC with a filter capacitor connected:</p>
<p>Explain why this is. How can the addition of nothing but a capacitor have such a great effect on the amount of DC voltage output by the circuit?</p>
<p>The filter capacitor captures the peak voltage level of each pulse from the rectifier circuit, holding that peak level during the time between pulses.</p>
<p>Many new students find this phenomenon paradoxical, especially when they see a DC output voltage <em>greater</em> than the AC (RMS) output voltage of the transformerâ€™s secondary winding. Case in point: being able to build a 30 volt DC power supply using a transformer with a secondary voltage rating of only 24 volts. The purpose of this question is to get students to face this paradox if they have not recognized and resolved it already.</p>
