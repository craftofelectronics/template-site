<p>A technician picks up a resistor with the following color bands:</p>
<p>Color code: <strong>Brn, Blk, Sil, Gld</strong></p>
<p>Having forgotten the resistor color code, and being too lazy to research the color code in a book, the technician decides to simply measure its resistance with an ohmmeter. The value this technician obtains is 0.6 <span class="math">Ω </span>.</p>
<p>What is wrong with the technician’s measurement?</p>
<p>The resistance measurement is too high (it should be closer to 0.1 <span class="math">Ω </span>) because the ohmmeter was not properly set up to compensate for test lead resistance.</p>
<p>Analog ohmmeters had to be &quot;zeroed&quot; prior to almost every measurement out of necessity, to give accurate measurements despite changes in internal battery voltage. Modern digital ohmmeters do not have this problem, but the lack of a &quot;zeroing&quot; procedure can lead to errors due to uncompensated test lead resistance. Your students should research the proper use of their own digital meters in this regard.</p>
