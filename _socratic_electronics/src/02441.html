<p>Calculate the approximate amount of AC voltage output by this common-collector amplifier circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02441x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Also, determine a signal frequency value that yields less than 1 ohm of reactance for each of the two coupling capacitors.</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>o</em><em>u</em><em>t</em></sub> ≈ </span> 2.5 volts peak or 1.77 volts RMS (assuming a sinusoidal source). A signal frequency of 3.39 kHz or greater will ensure the capacitive reactances will remain less than 1 ohm each.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: calculate the approximate (average) DC voltage dropped across the 1 k<span class="math">Ω </span> emitter resistor.</p>
<p>Students should know the AC voltage gain of this amplifier configuration to be approximately 1, so the output voltage calculation should be trivial. This question is really a test to see whether or not students are able to apply their knowledge of voltage gain to a specific application.</p>
