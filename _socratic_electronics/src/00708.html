<p>Identify the function of this active filter:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00708x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>It is low pass, high pass, band pass, or band stop? Explain your answer.</p>
<p>This is a band pass filter circuit.</p>
<p>Discuss with your students their methods of determining filter type. How did they approach this problem, to see what type of filter this circuit was? Determining the identify of a &quot;band-&quot; filter is more difficult than with a low- or a high- pass filter circuit, because the behavior is roughly the same at both extremes of the frequency range.</p>
