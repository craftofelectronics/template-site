<p>Two people are debating electron flow versus conventional flow. One of them says that the you will get different results predicting polarity of voltage drops in a resistive circuit depending on which convention you use. The other person says the convention for labeling current does not matter at all, and that the correct polarities will be predicted either way.</p>
<p>Which of these two people is correct? Explain why, and give an example to prove your point.</p>
<p>I will let pictures show the answer to this question:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{04082x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>It is important to remember that there is only one convention for using &quot;+&quot; and &quot;-&quot; symbols to designate the polarity of a voltage drop (thankfully!).</p>
