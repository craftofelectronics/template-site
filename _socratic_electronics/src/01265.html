<p>Bipolar junction transistors are classified as <em>minority carrier</em> devices. Explain why.</p>
<p>Conduction through a BJT depends on charge carriers being &quot;injected&quot; into the base layer of the transistor, and these charge carriers are always the &quot;minority&quot; type with respect to the doping of the base.</p>
<p>Note to your students that there is such a thing as a <em>majority carrier</em> type of transistor, but that it does not resemble the BJT in either construction or operational characteristics.</p>
