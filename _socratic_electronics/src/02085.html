<p>A series AC circuit contains 1125 ohms of resistance and 1500 ohms of reactance for a total circuit impedance of 1875 ohms. This may be represented graphically in the form of an impedance triangle:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02085x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Since all side lengths on this triangle are known, there is no need to apply the Pythagorean Theorem. However, we may still calculate the two non-perpendicular angles in this triangle using &quot;inverse&quot; trigonometric functions, which are sometimes called <em>arc</em>functions.</p>
<p>Identify which arc-function should be used to calculate the angle <span class="math">Θ </span> given the following pairs of sides:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$R \hbox{ and } Z$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$X \hbox{ and } R$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$X \hbox{ and } Z$</span><br /></p>
<p>Show how three different trigonometric arcfunctions may be used to calculate the same angle <span class="math">Θ </span>.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\arccos {R \over Z} = 53.13^o$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\arctan {X \over R} = 53.13^o$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\arcsin {X \over Z} = 53.13^o$</span><br /></p>
<p>Challenge question: identify three <em>more</em> arcfunctions which could be used to calculate the same angle <span class="math">Θ </span>.</p>
<p>Some hand calculators identify arc-trig functions by the letter &quot;A&quot; prepending each trigonometric abbreviation (e.g. &quot;ASIN&quot; or &quot;ATAN&quot;). Other hand calculators use the inverse function notation of a -1 exponent, which is <em>not</em> actually an exponent at all (e.g. <span class="math">sin<sup> − 1</sup></span> or <span class="math">tan<sup> − 1</sup></span>). Be sure to discuss function notation on your students’ calculators, so they know what to invoke when solving problems such as this.</p>
