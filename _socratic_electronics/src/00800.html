<p>Shown here is a simplified schematic diagram of one of the operational amplifiers inside a TL08x (TL081, TL082, or TL084) op-amp integrated circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00800x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Qualitatively determine what will happen to the output voltage (<span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>o</em><em>u</em><em>t</em></sub></span>) if the voltage on the noninverting input (<span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>i</em><em>n</em> + </sub></span>) increases, and the voltage on the inverting input (<span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>i</em><em>n</em> − </sub></span>) remains the same (all voltages are positive quantities, referenced to -V). Explain what happens at every stage of the op-amp circuit (voltages increasing or decreasing, currents increasing or decreasing) with this change in input voltage.</p>
<p>Here, I’ve labeled a few of the important voltage changes in the circuit, resulting from the increase in noninverting input voltage (<span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>i</em><em>n</em> + </sub></span>):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00800x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The answer provided here is minimal. Challenge your students to follow the whole circuit through until the end, qualitatively assessing voltage and current changes.</p>
<p>Incidentally, the strange-looking double-circle symbol is a <em>current source</em>. Ask your students if they were able to find a reference anywhere describing what this symbol means.</p>
