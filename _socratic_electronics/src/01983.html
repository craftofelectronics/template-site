<p>If a wire coil with 450 turns is exposed to a magnetic flux increasing at a rate of 0.008 Webers per second, how much voltage will be induced across the coil?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01983x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>3.6 volts</p>
<p>This is simply a quantitative application of Faradayâ€™s Law. There is no significance to the fact that the magnetic flux is increasing rather than decreasing. The only effect this would have on the induced voltage is its polarity.</p>
