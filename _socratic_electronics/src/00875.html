<p>Although the following symbol is generally interpreted as an operational amplifier (&quot;op-amp&quot;), it may also be used to represent a <em>comparator</em>:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00875x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>What is the difference between a comparator such as the model LM319, and a true operational amplifier such as the model LM324? Are the two devices interchangeable, or is there any significant difference despite the exact same schematic symbols? Explain your answer.</p>
<p>Comparators are designed for <em>open-loop</em> operation only (no feedback), while operational amplifiers are designed to perform well with feedback. For many simple applications, though, a true op-amp does a reasonable job as a comparator.</p>
<p>The answer to this question invokes a couple of terms your students may not be familiar with yet: &quot;open-loop&quot; and &quot;feedback&quot;. Discuss these terms with your students, asking them first if they were able to arrive at definitions for them.</p>
