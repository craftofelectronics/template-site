<p>Describe what the output voltage of this transistor circuit will do (measured with reference to ground), if the potentiometer wiper begins at the full-down position (common with ground), and is slowly moved in the <em>upward</em> direction (closer to +V):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00822x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>o</em><em>u</em><em>t</em></sub></span> will decrease, from +10 volts to nearly zero volts, as the potentiometer wiper is moved closer to +V.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: based on this result, would you be inclined to call this amplifier an <em>inverting</em> or a <em>noninverting</em> circuit?</p>
<p>Although this circuit is very simple, it is also very important to master. Be sure to discuss its operation thoroughly with your students, so they understand.</p>
