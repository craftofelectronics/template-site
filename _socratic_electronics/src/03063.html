<p>Solve for <span class="math"><em>n</em></span> in the following equations:</p>
<p>Equation 1: <span class="math"> − 56 =  − 14<em>n</em></span></p>
<p>Equation 2: <span class="math">54 − <em>n</em> = 10</span></p>
<p>Equation 3: <span class="math">${4 \over n} = 12$</span></p>
<p>Equation 4: <span class="math">28 = 2 − <em>n</em></span></p>
<p>Equation 1: <span class="math"><em>n</em> = 4</span></p>
<p>Equation 2: <span class="math"><em>n</em> = 44</span></p>
<p>Equation 3: <span class="math">$n = 0.\overline{333}$</span></p>
<p>Equation 4: <span class="math"><em>n</em> =  − 26</span></p>
<p>Have your students come to the front of the class and show everyone else the techniques they used to solve for the value of <span class="math"><em>a</em></span> in each equation. Remind them to document each and every step in the process, so that nothing is left to guess or to chance.</p>
<p>Equations 2 through 4 require two steps to solve for <span class="math"><em>n</em></span>. Equation 1 only requires a single step, but the two negative numbers may be a bit confusing to some.</p>
