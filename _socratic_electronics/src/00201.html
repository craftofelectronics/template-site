<p>Two 470 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>F capacitors connected in series are subjected to a total applied voltage that changes at a rate of 200 volts per second. How much current will there be &quot;through&quot; these capacitors? Hint: the total voltage is divided evenly between the two capacitors.</p>
<p>Now suppose that two 470 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>F capacitors connected in parallel are subjected to the same total applied voltage (changing at a rate of 200 volts per second). How much total current will there be &quot;through&quot; these capacitors?</p>
<p>Series connection: 47 milliamps (mA) total. Parallel connection: 188 milliamps (mA) total.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: what do these figures indicate about the nature of series-connected and parallel connected capacitors? In other words, what single capacitor value is equivalent to two series-connected 470 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>F capacitors, and what single capacitor value is equivalent to two parallel-connected 470 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>F capacitors?</p>
<p>If your students are having difficulty answering the follow-up question in the Answer, ask them to compare these current figures (47 mA and 188 mA) against the current that would go through just one of the 470 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>F capacitors under the same condition (an applied voltage changing at a rate of 200 volts per second).</p>
<p>It is, of course, important that students know how series-connected and parallel connected capacitors behave. However, this is typically a process of rote memorization for students rather than true understanding. With this question, the goal is to have students come to a realization of capacitor connections based on their understanding of series and parallel voltages and currents.</p>
