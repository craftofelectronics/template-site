<p>Identify at least one advantage that active filter circuits may have over passive filter circuits.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Potential for steeper rolloff than passive filters.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> No loss of signal amplitude as always happens with passive filters.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Relative immunity to changes in source and load impedances.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Some active filter circuits provide multiple filter functions in one (e.g. the <em>state variable</em> active filter).</p>
