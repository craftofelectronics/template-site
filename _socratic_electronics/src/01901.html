<p>Complete the following sentences with one of these phrases: &quot;shorter than,&quot; &quot;longer than,&quot; or &quot;equal to&quot;. Then, explain why the time constant of each circuit type must be so.</p>
<p>Passive integrator circuits should have time constants that are (<em>fill-in-the-blank</em>) the period of the waveform being integrated.</p>
<p>Passive differentiator circuits should have time constants that are (<em>fill-in-the-blank</em>) the period of the waveform being differentiated.</p>
<p>Passive integrators need to have <em>slow</em> time constants, while passive differentiators need to have <em>fast</em> time constants, in order to reasonably integrate and differentiate.</p>
<p>If students donâ€™t understand why this is, let them work through an example problem, to see what the output waveform(s) would look like for various periods and time constants. Remember to stress what an ideal integrator or differentiator is supposed to do!</p>
