<p>Suppose a student builds this circuit and notices that it spontaneously breaks into oscillations, whether or not the &quot;microphone&quot; speaker is picking up any sound. Identify some possible causes of oscillation in a circuit like this, as well as possible fixes.</p>
<p>At root, the cause of oscillation in an amplifier circuit is some form of positive (regenerative) feedback. Possible causes include:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Insufficient power supply decoupling (<em>add a large capacitor across the power supply terminals of the opamp.</em>)</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Stray capacitive coupling between input and output wiring (<em>re-route wires, keeping input and output wiring well separated.</em>)</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Amplifier gain too high (<em>add limiting resistor(s) to the opamp’s feedback to prevent the gain adjustment from being set too high.</em>)</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Transformer phasing (<em>reverse one winding of the transformer with respect to the other winding.</em>)</p>
<p>Unwanted oscillations in amplifier circuitry is a very real problem many electronics technicians and engineers alike must face. There is often no single correct solution to the problem, given the multiple avenues through which regenerative feedback may take place in a circuit.</p>
