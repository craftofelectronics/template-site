<p>Measure the forward voltage drop of a silicon rectifying diode, such as a model 1N4001. How close is the measured forward voltage drop to the &quot;ideal&quot; figure usually assumed for silicon PN junctions? What happens when you increase the temperature of the diode by holding on to it with your fingers? What happens when you decrease the temperature of the diode by touching an ice cube to it?</p>
<p>Did you really think I was going to give away the answer here, and spoil the fun of setting up an experiment?</p>
<p>Diodes are quite temperature-sensitive, so this experiment will be very easy to conduct. You may not have ice available in your classroom, but thatâ€™s okay. Your students should realize that experiments such as this are perfectly fair to perform at home, where they probably do have access to ice.</p>
