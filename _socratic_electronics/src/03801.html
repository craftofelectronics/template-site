<p>This operational amplifier circuit is often referred to as a <em>voltage buffer</em>, because it has unity gain (0 dB) and therefore simply reproduces, or &quot;buffers,&quot; the input voltage:</p>

<p>What possible use is a circuit such as this, which offers no voltage gain or any other form of signal modification? Wouldnâ€™t a straight piece of wire do the same thing? Explain your answers.</p>

<p>While this circuit offers no voltage gain, it does offer <em>current gain</em> and <em>impedance transformation</em>. Much like the common-collector (or common-drain) single transistor amplifier circuits which also had voltage gains of (near) unity, opamp buffer circuits are useful whenever one must drive a relatively &quot;heavy&quot; (low impedance) load with a signal coming from a &quot;weak&quot; (high impedance) source.</p>
<p>I have found that some students have difficulty with the terms &quot;heavy&quot; and &quot;light&quot; in reference to load characteristics. That a &quot;heavy&quot; load would have very few ohms of impedance, and a &quot;light&quot; load would have many ohms of impedance seems counter-intuitive to some. It all makes sense, though, once students realize the terms &quot;heavy&quot; and &quot;light&quot; refer to the amount of <em>current</em> drawn by the respective loads.</p>
<p>Ask your students to explain why the straight piece of wire fails to &quot;buffer&quot; the voltage signal in the same way the the opamp follower circuit does.</p>
