<p>Solve this equation for the value of <span class="math"><em>x</em></span>:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math"><em>x</em> + 5 = 8</span><br /></p>
<p>How many exact solutions does the above equation have?</p>
<p>Now, determine a few <em>different</em> solutions for the following equation:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math"><em>x</em> + <em>y</em> = 8</span><br /></p>
<p>How many exact solutions does this equation have? Plot this equation’s solutions on the following graph:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03091x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\hbox{If } x + 5 = 8 \hbox{ , then } x = 3 \hbox{ (exactly one solution)}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\hbox{If } x + y = 8 \hbox{ , then there are an infinite number of solutions:}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03091x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Follow-up question: find the solution to <span class="math"><em>x</em> + 5 = 8</span> on this same graph.</p>
<p>This question begins with an extremely simple equation having one solution and moves on to another simple equation having an infinite number of solutions. While an infinitude of correct answers may seem impossible to rationally deal with, a graph handles it quite nicely, the multitude of correct answer pairs represented as a line on a graph with infinite length.</p>
