<p>A special class of electromechanical relays called <em>time-delay</em> relays provide delayed action, either upon power-up or power-down, and are commonly denoted in ladder logic diagrams by &quot;TD&quot; or &quot;TR&quot; designations near the coil symbols and arrows on the contact symbols. Here is an example of a time-delay relay contact used in a motor control circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03141x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>In this circuit, the motor delays start-up until three seconds <em>after</em> the switch is thrown to the &quot;Run&quot; position, but will stop immediately when the switch is returned to the &quot;Stop&quot; position. The relay contact is referred to as <em>normally-open, timed-closed</em>, or NOTC. It is alternatively referred to as a <em>normally-open, on-delay</em> contact.</p>
<p>Explain how the arrow symbol indicates the nature of this contactâ€™s delay, that delay occurs during closure but not during opening.</p>
<p>Note that the &quot;arrow&quot; is pointing in the up direction, toward the direction of contact closure.</p>
<p>The arrow symbol is not difficult to figure out, but it is essential to know when working with time-delay relay circuits. Ask your students to describe their understanding of the arrow symbol as they answer this question.</p>
