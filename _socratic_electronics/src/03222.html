<p>The following schematic diagram shows a timer circuit made from a UJT and an SCR:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03222x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Together, the combination of <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span>, <span class="math"><em>C</em><sub>1</sub></span>, <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span>, <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>3</sub></span>, and <span class="math"><em>Q</em><sub>1</sub></span> form a <em>relaxation oscillator</em>, which outputs a square wave signal. Explain how a square wave oscillation is able to perform a simple time-delay for the load, where the load energizes a certain time <em>after</em> the toggle switch is closed. Also explain the purpose of the RC network formed by <span class="math"><em>C</em><sub>2</sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>4</sub></span>.</p>
<p>Remember that <span class="math"><em>C</em><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> only needs one pulse at its gate to turn (and latch) it on! <span class="math"><em>C</em><sub>2</sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>4</sub></span> form a <em>passive differentiator</em> to condition the square wave signal from the UJT oscillator.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: how would you suggest we modify this circuit to make the time delay adjustable?</p>
<p>Knowing that the UJT forms an oscillator, it is tempting to think that the load will turn on and off repeatedly. The first sentence in the answer explains why this will not happen, though.</p>
<p>I got the basic idea for this circuit from the second edition of , by Stephen L. Herman.</p>
