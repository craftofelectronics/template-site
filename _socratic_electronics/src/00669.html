<p>Suppose the load in this circuit suddenly stops receiving power:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00669x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Your first step in troubleshooting is to take some voltage measurements:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>A</em><em>B</em></sub></span> = 120 V</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>E</em><em>C</em></sub></span> = 0 V</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>D</em><em>C</em></sub></span> = 120 V</p>
<p>Based on these measurements, where do you think the fault is in this circuit, and what type of fault is it?</p>
<p>I’ll let you determine the most likely failure on your own!</p>
<p>Ask your students to think of some other possibilities for failure in this circuit besides their first hypothesis. Also, discuss how you would verify (double-check) all hypotheses, with different meter measurements.</p>
