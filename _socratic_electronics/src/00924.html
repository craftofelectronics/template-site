<p>How much voltage would have to be &quot;dialed up&quot; at the potentiometer in order to stabilize the output at exactly 0 volts, assuming the opamp has no input offset voltage?</p>

<p>5 volts</p>
<p>This question is a basic review of an ideal differential amplifier’s function. Ask your students what voltage must be &quot;dialed up&quot; at the potentiometer to produce 0 volts at the output of the op-amp for several different voltages at the other input. If they don’t understand at first, they soon will after discussing these alternate scenarios.</p>
