<p>Suppose a DC power source with a voltage of 50 volts is connected to a 10 <span class="math">Ω </span> load. How much power will this load dissipate?</p>
<p>Now suppose the same 10 <span class="math">Ω </span> load is connected to a sinusoidal AC power source with a <em>peak</em> voltage of 50 volts. Will the load dissipate the same amount of power, more power, or less power? Explain your answer.</p>
<p>50 volts DC applied to a 10 <span class="math">Ω </span> load will dissipate 250 watts of power. 50 volts (peak, sinusoidal) AC will deliver less than 250 watts to the same load.</p>
<p>There are many analogies to explain this discrepancy between the two &quot;50 volt&quot; sources. One is to compare the physical effort of a person pushing with a constant force of 50 pounds, versus someone who pushes intermittently with only a <em>peak</em> force of 50 pounds.</p>
