<p>Determine the approximate amount of voltage that each voltmeter in this circuit will indicate:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00786x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Note: the voltage readings shown by the voltmeters are <em>approximate</em> only!</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00786x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Challenge question: how could the 58 volts from (-) to ground be eliminated, so as to permit grounding of the (-) output terminal?</p>
<p>Direct rectification of a grounded AC power source results in significant voltage being dropped between either DC output conductor and ground. Ask your students what kinds of problems might be caused by this effect. How about safety? Ask them if they think 58 volts presents a safety hazard.</p>
<p>In answer to the challenge question, what is needed here is some kind of electrical isolation. There is more than one answer to this problem, but definitely one solution that is more popular than the others.</p>
