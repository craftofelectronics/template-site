<p>The amount of capacitance between two conductors may be calculated by the following equation:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$C = {\epsilon A \over d}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Where,</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>C</em> = </span> Capacitance in Farads</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>ε</em> = </span> Permittivity of dielectric (absolute)</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>A</em> = </span> Conductor area, in square meters</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>d</em> = </span> Separation distance, in meters</p>
<p>How far away from each other would two metal plates, 2 square meters in area each, have to be in order to create a capacitance of 1 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>F? Assume that the plates are separated by air.</p>
<p>If you calculated a distance in the order of 2 million meters (<span class="math">2 × 10<sup>6</sup></span> meters), you made a common mistake! The proper answer is 17.71 micro-meters (<span class="math">17. 71 × 10<sup> − 6</sup></span> meters), or 0.01771 millimeters.</p>
<p>This problem is first and foremost an algebraic manipulation exercise. Then, it is merely a matter of solving for <span class="math"><em>d</em></span> given the proper values. Finding <span class="math"><em>ε</em></span> could be difficult, though, and this is by design: I want students to learn the significance of <em>absolute</em> permittivity!</p>
