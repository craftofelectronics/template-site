<p>It is a common phenomenon for the electrical resistance of a substance to change with changes in temperature. Explain how you would experimentally demonstrate this effect.</p>
<p>It is a simple thing to demonstrate a substance’s change in resistance with temperature. I’m interested in finding out how you might discern a <em>quantitative</em> measurement of this change. That is, how would you design an experiment so as to &quot;attach a number&quot; to the effect of resistance changing with temperature?</p>
<p>This question is an excellent starting point for an in-class experiment. There are several ways in which this effect could be demonstrated.</p>
