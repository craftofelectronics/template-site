<p>Sound pressure is often measured in units of dBA. You should be familiar with decibels as a unit of amplifier gain, but what does &quot;db<em>A</em>&quot; actually mean? How is 0 dBA objectively defined?</p>
<p>0 dBA = 1 pW/m<span class="math">$^{2} $</span><span class="math"> ≈ </span> &quot;Threshold of human hearing&quot;</p>
<p>Discuss with your students how decibels are an appropriate way to express sound intensity, due to the very nonlinear sensitivity of human hearing. In fact, the very genesis of the decibel scale was early telephone system design, where engineers had to rate signal loss in terms that were meaningful to human users.</p>
