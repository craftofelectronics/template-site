<p>Plot the relative B-H curves for a sample of air and a sample of iron, in proportion to each other (as much as possible):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03515x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>What do you notice about the slope (also called the derivative, or <span class="math">$dB \over dH$</span>) of each plot?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03515x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Follow-up question: note that the slope of both plots are approximately equal toward the far right end of the graph. Explain this effect in terms of magnetic <em>saturation</em>.</p>
<p>The purpose of this question is twofold: to get students to see that a ferromagnetic material such as iron is <em>much</em> more permeable (less &quot;reluctant&quot;) than air, but that the great gains in <span class="math"><em>B</em></span> realized by iron tend to disappear as soon as saturation sets in. Once the iron is saturated, the gains in <span class="math"><em>B</em></span> for equal advances in <span class="math"><em>H</em></span> are the same as for air. That is, the <span class="math">$dB \over dH$</span> for iron is equal to the <span class="math">$dB \over dH $</span> for air once the iron is saturated.</p>
