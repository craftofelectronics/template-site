<p>Determine the amount of voltage measured at points <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong> with reference to ground, and also determine voltage <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>A</em><em>B</em></sub></span> (defined here as the voltage indicated by a voltmeter with the red test lead touching point <strong>A</strong> and the black test lead touching point <strong>B</strong>):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01958x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math">$V_A = +9 \hbox{ volts}$</span></p>
<p><span class="math">$V_B = +6 \hbox{ volts}$</span></p>
<p><span class="math">$V_{AB} = +3 \hbox{ volts}$</span></p>
<p>Follow-up question: explain why the mathematical signs (&quot;+&quot;) are important in these answers.</p>
<p>Determining differential voltages is a skill that many students find frustrating to attain. There is more than one way to explain how to arrive at +3 volts as the answer for <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>A</em><em>B</em></sub></span>, and it is good for students to see more than one way presented.</p>
