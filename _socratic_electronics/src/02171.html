<p>Power is easy to calculate in DC circuits. Take for example this DC light bulb circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02171x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Calculate the power dissipation in this circuit, and describe the transfer of energy from source to load: where does the energy come from and where does it go to?</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>P</em></span> = 264 Watts</p>
<p>If the source is a chemical battery, energy comes from the chemical reactions occurring in the batteryâ€™s electrolyte, becomes transfered to electrical form, and then converted to heat and light in the bulb, all at the rate of 264 Joules per second (J/s).</p>
<p>Discuss with your students the one-way flow of energy in a circuit such as this. Although electric current takes a circular path, the actual transfer of energy is one-way: from source to load. This is very important to understand, as things become more complex when reactive (inductive and capacitive) components are considered.</p>
