<p>Suppose an oscilloscope has been set up to display a triangle wave:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01907x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The horizontal position knob is then turned clockwise until the left-hand edge of the waveform is visible:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01907x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Now, the point at which the waveform triggers is clearly visible, no longer hidden from view past the left-hand side of the screen:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01907x03.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>What will happen now if the trigger level knob is turned clockwise? How will this affect the positioning of the waveform on the oscilloscope screen?</p>
<p>The waveform will shift to the left as the trigger level is raised:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01907x04.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>There is nothing special about a triangle wave here. To be perfectly honest, it was the easiest waveform for me to draw which had a sloping edge to trigger on!</p>
<p>By the way, for students to really understand how triggering works, it is important for them to spend time &quot;playing&quot; with an oscilloscope and a signal generator trying things like this. There is only so much one can learn about the operation of a machine by reading!</p>
