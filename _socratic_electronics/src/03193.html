<p>The design recommendation for this circuit is to make resistors <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>3</sub></span> both equal to the resistance of the potentiometer <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>p</em><em>o</em><em>t</em>2</sub></span>. This way, the full mechanical range of the potentiometer will be useful for adjusting duty cycle: fully turning it one way will just produce a 0% duty cycle, while fully turning it the other way will just produce a 100% duty cycle.</p>
<p>Explain why those resistor values need to be equal to achieve this optimum usage of pot range. Hint: it has something to do with the internal workings of the 555 timer IC.</p>
<p>The sawtooth signal seen at capacitor <span class="math"><em>C</em><sub>1</sub></span> (with reference to ground) oscillates between <span class="math">${1 \over 3}$</span> and <span class="math">${2 \over 3}$</span> supply voltage.</p>
<p>This question forces students to explore what the 555 is really doing, and to recognize the comparatorâ€™s function in generating PWM square waves.</p>
