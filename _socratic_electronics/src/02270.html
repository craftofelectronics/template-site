<p>Plot what the frequency spectrum would look like for a pure (undistorted) 1 MHz sine wave:</p>

<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02270x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>This question probes studentsâ€™ knowledge of frequency spectra and logarithmic scales. Note that with a pure sine wave, there is but a single peak on the frequency spectrum.</p>
