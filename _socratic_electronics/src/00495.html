<p>Determine the sum of these two phasors, and draw a phasor diagram showing their geometric addition:</p>
<p>(4 <span class="math">∠</span> 0<span class="math">$^o$</span>) + (3 <span class="math">∠</span> 90<span class="math">$^o$</span>)</p>
<p>How might a phasor arithmetic problem such as this relate to an AC circuit?</p>
<p>(4 <span class="math">∠</span> 0<span class="math">$^o$</span>) + (3 <span class="math">∠</span> 90<span class="math">$^o$</span>) = (5 <span class="math">∠</span> 36.87<span class="math">$^o$</span>)</p>

<p>It is very helpful in a question such as this to graphically depict the phasors. Have one of your students draw a phasor diagram on the whiteboard for the whole class to observe and discuss.</p>
<p>The relation of this arithmetic problem to an AC circuit is a very important one for students to grasp. It is one thing for students to be able to mathematically manipulate and combine phasors, but quite another for them to smoothly transition between a phasor operation and comprehension of voltages and/or currents in an AC circuit. Ask your students to describe what the <em>magnitude</em> of a phasor means (in this example, the number 5), if that phasor represents an AC voltage. Ask your students to describe what the <em>angle</em> of an AC voltage phasor means, as well (in this case, 36.87<span class="math">$^{o}$</span>), for an AC voltage.</p>
