<p>Something is wrong with this circuit. Based on the oscilloscopeâ€™s display, determine whether the battery or the function generator is faulty:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03448x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The battery is faulty.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: discuss how accidently setting the coupling control on the oscilloscope to &quot;AC&quot; instead of &quot;DC&quot; would also cause this waveform to show on the screen (even with a good battery).</p>
<p>This question challenges students to apply their knowledge of AC+DC mixed signals to oscilloscope display patterns, in order to determine whether it is the battery or the function generator which has failed.</p>
