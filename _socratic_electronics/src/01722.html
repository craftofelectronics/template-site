<p>Follow-up question #1: without performing any mathematical calculations, determine the effects on all the component voltage drops and currents if resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span> were to fail <em>open</em>.</p>
<p>Follow-up question #2: without performing any mathematical calculations, determine the effects on all the component voltage drops and currents if resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span> were to fail <em>shorted</em>.</p>
<p>Discuss with your students what a good procedure might be for calculating the unknown values in this problem, and also how they might check their work.</p>
