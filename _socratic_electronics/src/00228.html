<p>The mathematical equivalence between <em>watts</em> and <em>horsepower</em> is approximately 746:1. Given this equivalency, how many watts of electrical energy may theoretically be produced by a generator, if turned by an engine rated at 50 horsepower?</p>
<p>37.3 kW of electrical power.</p>
<p>Unit conversion problems are handled most easily by using &quot;unity fractions&quot; comprised of a quotient of two different numerical quantities having the same physical value. For instance:</p>
