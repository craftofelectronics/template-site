<p>The following illustration is a cross-section of an <em>insulated gate field-effect transistor</em>, sometimes referred to as an <em>IGFET</em>:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02070x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Explain what happens when a positive voltage is applied to the gate (with reference to the substrate), with regard to electrical conductivity between the source and drain:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02070x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>When enough positive voltage is applied to the gate, an <em>inversion layer</em> forms just beneath it, creating an N-type channel for source-drain current:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02070x03.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Ask your students to explain how the inversion layer forms, and what it means for source-drain conduction if no inversion layer is present.</p>
<p>Discuss with your students the fact that this inversion layer is incredibly thin; so this that it is often referred to as a two-dimensional &quot;sheet&quot; of charge carriers.</p>
<p>Also mention to your students that although &quot;IGFET&quot; is the general term for such a device, &quot;MOSFET&quot; is more commonly used as a designator due to the deviceâ€™s history.</p>
