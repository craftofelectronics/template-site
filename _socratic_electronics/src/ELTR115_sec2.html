<p>The very idea of such a thing as &quot;imaginary power&quot; (reactive power) is hard to grasp. Basically, what we’re talking about here is current in an AC circuit that is not contributing to work being done because it is out of phase with the voltage waveform. Instead of contributing to useful work (energy leaving the circuit), it merely stores and releases energy from reactive components. In a purely reactive circuit, <em>all</em> power in the circuit is &quot;imaginary&quot; and does no useful work. In a purely resistive circuit, <em>all</em> power is &quot;real&quot; and is dissipated from the circuit by the resistance (this is also true of motor circuits operating at 100% efficiency, where energy leaves not in the form of heat but in the form of mechanical work). In all realistic circuits, power is some combination of &quot;real&quot; and &quot;imaginary;&quot; true and reactive.</p>
<p>Phase shift is not as easy to measure with an oscilloscope as is amplitude or frequency, and it takes practice to learn. Some students have a tendency to look for memorizable formulae or step-by-step procedures for doing this rather than to figure out how and why it works. As I am fond of telling my students, <em>memory will fail you! Understand, don’t memorize!</em> Phase shift measurement is not as difficult as it may look. Once you figure out the relationship between horizontal divisions on the oscilloscope screen and the period (360<span class="math">$^{o}$</span>) of the waveforms, figuring phase shift is merely a matter of ratio: <span class="math"><em>x</em></span> divisions of shift is to the number of divisions per cycle as <span class="math"><em>y</em></span> degrees of shift is to 360<span class="math">$^{o}$</span>.</p>
<p>Electrical systems having more than one phase (<em>poly-</em>phase) are tremendously useful and prevalent in modern industry. The idea of having multiple voltages and currents in a system all out of phase with each other may seem a little weird and confusing, but it is very necessary to know. Perhaps the best way to grasp what is going on in these systems is to see a video animation of three-phase power being generated, or a three-phase motor in action. As I teacher, I like to use blinking Christmas lights or the motion of crowds in grandstands sequentially waving (&quot;The Wave&quot;) as an illustration of the large-scale &quot;motion&quot; one may create with out-of-phase sequences.</p>
<p>When it comes to mathematically analyzing what is happening in polyphase systems, phasor diagrams are most useful. Try to apply a phasor diagram to polyphase problems which you know the solution(s) to, and then see how the same types of diagrams may apply to problems you are currently trying to solve.</p>
