<p>Suppose a technician connected a potentiometer to the input of a VCO, to act as a manually-variable voltage source. Then, the technician compares the output of the VCO with an external signal source that slowly changes frequency, adjusting the potentiometer to keep the two frequencies equal:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01144x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>If a voltmeter were connected between the potentiometer wiper and ground, what would its indication represent (with regard to the external audio signal)?</p>
<p>Explain where <em>feedback</em> occurs in this system, and how the system may be automated so as to not require the continual attention of a technician.</p>
<p>The wiper voltage in this system is representative of the external signal’s frequency. Feedback occurs in the &quot;loop&quot; formed by the technician’s hand, adjusting the potentiometer in response to changes in differential frequency.</p>
<p>Tell your students that voltage-controlled oscillators are sometimes called <em>voltage-to-frequency converters</em>. Then, ask them to explain how the presence of feedback in this system provides a <em>frequency-to-voltage conversion</em> function.</p>
<p>The question regarding automation of this system may be challenging for some of your students. If they cannot give a technical answer for this question, ask them to explain &quot;in layman’s terms&quot; what the additional components must do. Accurately identifying the function of a human operator is the first step in designing an automation system!</p>
