<p>Modify the schematic diagram for a Hartley oscillator to include a <em>crystal</em>. What advantage(s) does a crystal-controlled Hartley oscillator exhibit over a regular Hartley oscillator?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01084x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Follow-up question: does the resonant frequency of the tank circuit have to match the crystalâ€™s resonant frequency? Why or why not?</p>
<p>Ask your students to explain what purpose a crystal serves in an oscillator circuit that already contains a tank circuit for tuning.</p>
