<p>Shown here are two energy diagrams: one for a &quot;P&quot; type semiconducting material and another for an &quot;N&quot; type.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00906x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Next is an energy diagram showing the <em>initial</em> state when these two pieces of semiconducting material are brought into contact with each other. This is known as a <em>flatband diagram</em>:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00906x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The state represented by the &quot;flatband&quot; diagram is most definitely a temporary one. The two different Fermi levels are incompatible with one another in the absence of an external electric field.</p>
<p>Draw a new energy diagram representing the final energy states after the two Fermi levels have equalized.</p>
<p><em>Note: <span class="math"><em>E</em><sub><em>f</em></sub></span> represents the Fermi energy level, and not a voltage. In physics, <span class="math"><em>E</em></span> always stands for energy and <span class="math"><em>V</em></span> for electric potential (voltage).</em></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00906x03.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Electrons from the N-piece rushed over to fill holes in the P-piece <em>in order to achieve a lower energy state</em> and equalize the two Fermi levels. This displacement of charge carriers created an electric field which accounts for the sloped energy bands in the middle region.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: what is this middle region called?</p>
<p>This is one of those concepts I just couldnâ€™t understand when I had no comprehension of the quantum nature of electrons. In the &quot;planetary&quot; atomic model, there is no reason whatsoever for electrons to move from the N-piece to the P-piece unless there was an electric field pushing them in that direction. And conversely, once an electric field was created by the imbalance of electrons, the free-wheeling planetary theory would have predicted that the electrons move right back where they came from in order to neutralize the field.</p>
<p>Once you grasp the significance of quantized energy states, and the principle that particles do not &quot;hold on&quot; to unnecessary energy and therefore remain in high states when they could move down to a lower level, the concept becomes much clearer.</p>
