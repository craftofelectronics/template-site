<p>If a positive charge is forcibly moved closer to another positive charge, mechanical work must be performed. This is analogous to compressing a spring: work must be done to cause motion against the natural repulsion of the system:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01700x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>This mechanical work becomes &quot;stored&quot; in the electric field between the charges, and is a form of <em>potential energy</em>. This, again, is similar to a mechanical spring, where the work done in compressing a spring is &quot;stored&quot; as potential energy in its compressed state.</p>
<p>Define <em>voltage</em> in terms of the change in potential energy resulting from this forceful motion of the charge, the way a physicist would.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$V_{ab} = {{U_b - U_a} \over q}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Where,</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>a</em><em>b</em></sub> = </span> Voltage between points A and B</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>U</em><sub><em>b</em></sub> − <em>U</em><sub><em>a</em></sub> = </span> Difference in potential energy between points A and B</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>q</em> = </span> Quantity of charge (moved), in Coulombs</p>
<p>Follow-up question: explain why, if a charge of twice the magnitude (<span class="math">2<em>q</em></span>) were moved from the same point A to the same point B, there would be twice as much work done and twice as much potential energy stored, but exactly the same voltage (<em>potential</em>) as gained by the smaller charge (<span class="math"><em>q</em></span>).</p>
<p>If time permits, it is quite enlightening for students to discover that voltage may be defined in simple mechanical terms of repulsion and work. Of course, a basic familiarity with <em>work</em> in the scientific sense of the term is a prerequisite for understanding this scenario.</p>
