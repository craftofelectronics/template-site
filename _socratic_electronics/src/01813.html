<p>A formula I like to use in calculating voltage and current values in either RC or LR circuits has two forms, one for voltage and one for current:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$V(t) = \left( V_f - V_0 \right) \left( 1 - {1 \over {e^{t \over \tau}}} \right) + V_0 \hbox{ \hskip 15pt (for calculating voltage)}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$I(t) = \left( I_f - I_0 \right) \left( 1 - {1 \over {e^{t \over \tau}}} \right) + I_0 \hbox{ \hskip 15pt (for calculating current)}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The &quot;0&quot; subscript represents the condition at time = 0 (<span class="math"><em>V</em><sub>0</sub></span> or <span class="math"><em>I</em><sub>0</sub></span>, respectively), representing the &quot;initial&quot; value of that variable. The &quot;f&quot; subscript represents the &quot;final&quot; or &quot;ultimate&quot; value that the voltage or current would achieve if allowed to progress indefinitely. Obviously, one must know how to determine the &quot;initial&quot; and &quot;final&quot; values in order to use either of these formulae, but once you do you will be able to calculate <em>any</em> voltage and <em>any</em> current at <em>any</em> time in either an RC or LR circuit.</p>
<p>What is not so obvious to students is how each formula works. Specifically, what does each portion of it represent, in practical terms? This is your task: to describe what each term of the equation means in your own words. I will list the &quot;voltage&quot; formula terms individually for you to define:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math"><em>V</em>(<em>t</em>) = </span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">(<em>V</em><sub><em>f</em></sub> − <em>V</em><sub>0</sub>) = </span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\left( 1 - {1 \over {e^{t \over \tau}}} \right) =$</span><br /></p>
<p>The term <span class="math"><em>V</em>(<em>t</em>)</span> uses symbolism common to calculus and pre-calculus, pronounced &quot;<span class="math"><em>V</em></span> of <span class="math"><em>t</em></span>,&quot; meaning &quot;voltage at time <span class="math"><em>t</em></span>&quot;. It means that the variable <span class="math"><em>V</em></span> changes as a <em>function</em> of time <span class="math"><em>t</em></span>.</p>
<p><span class="math">(<em>V</em><sub><em>f</em></sub> − <em>V</em><sub>0</sub>)</span> represents the amount of <em>change</em> that the voltage would go through, from the start of the charge/discharge cycle until eternity. Note that the sign (positive or negative) of this term is very important!</p>
<p><span class="math">$\left( 1 - {1 \over {e^{t \over \tau}}} \right)$</span> is the fractional value (between 0 and 1, inclusive) expressing how far the voltage has changed from its initial value to its final value.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: why is it important to add the final <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub>0</sub></span> term to the expression? Why not leave the formula at <span class="math">$V(t) = \left( V_f - V_0 \right) \left( 1 - {1 \over {e^{t \over \tau}}} \right)$</span> ?</p>
<p>This so-called &quot;universal time-constant formula&quot; is my own (Tony R. Kuphaldt’s) invention. A product of frustration from trying to teach students to calculate variables in RC and LR time-constant circuits using one formula for decay and another one for increasing values, this equation works for <em>all</em> conditions. Vitally important to this formula’s accuracy, however, is that the student correctly assesses the initial and final values. This is the biggest problem I see students having when they go to calculate voltages or currents in time-constant circuits.</p>
<p>In my textbook, I introduce this formula in a slightly different form:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\Delta V = \left( V_f - V_0 \right) \left( 1 - {1 \over {e^{t \over \tau}}} \right)$</span><br /></p>
<p>This explains the purpose of my follow-up question: to challenge students who might simply read the book’s version of the formula and not consider the difference between it and what is presented here!</p>
