<p>What is wrong with this JFET circuit? What might happen to the transistor if this circuit is built and operated?</p>

<p>The gate-channel PN junction inside a JFET is not designed to handle much forward current!</p>
<p>Have your students consult a typical JFET datasheet and research the maximum gate current parameter. Discuss this parameter with your students, and also talk about how we can make sure this limitation is not exceeded in any circuit design.</p>
<p>The latter subject is very important for students because I have seen many a JFET destroyed by this exact type of abuse.</p>
