<p>If we wish to solve for the value of three inter-related variables (i.e. <span class="math"><em>x</em> + <em>y</em> + <em>z</em> = 0</span>), how many equations do we need in our &quot;system&quot; of simultaneous equations, total?</p>
<p>Graphically, what does the solution set (<span class="math"><em>x</em></span>,<span class="math"><em>y</em></span>,<span class="math"><em>z</em></span>) represent for a system of equations with three variables?</p>
<p>Three variables require three equations for solution. Graphically, the solution set represents the point at which three planes of infinite area intersect.</p>
<p>Ask your students to graphically contrast the scenario of three variables and three equations against two variables and two equations. Where is the solution set represented in a two-variable, two-equation system? How many we extrapolate from this situation to one where three variables and three equations are involved?</p>
