<p>Calculate the impedance value necessary to balance this AC bridge, expressing your answer in both polar and rectangular forms:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01863x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math">${\bf Z} =$</span> 1.975 k<span class="math">Ω </span> <span class="math">∠</span> 90<span class="math">$^{o}$</span> (polar form)</p>
<p><span class="math">${\bf Z} =$</span> 0 + j1.975 k<span class="math">Ω </span> (rectangular form)</p>
<p>Follow-up question: what type and size of component will provide this exact amount of impedance at 400 Hz?</p>
<p>So long as complex quantities are used, AC bridge circuits &quot;balance&quot; just the same way that DC bridge circuits balance. Consequently, this is really nothing new for your students if they’ve already studied DC Wheatstone bridge circuits.</p>
