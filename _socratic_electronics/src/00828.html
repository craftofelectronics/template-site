<p>Suppose an AC signal amplifier circuit has a voltage gain (ratio) of 5. That is, <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>o</em><em>u</em><em>t</em></sub></span> is five times as large as <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>i</em><em>n</em></sub></span>:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00828x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Translate this voltage gain ratio into a decibel figure. Explain why the conversion from voltage gain ratio to decibels is not the same as conversion of a power gain ratio to decibels.</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>A</em><sub><em>V</em></sub> = </span> 13.98 dB</p>
<p>Discuss with your students the nature of the &quot;Bel&quot; unit: it is fundamentally a unit of <em>power</em> gain, not voltage or current gain. So, representing voltage or current gains in units of either Bels or decibels means representing those voltage or current gains <em>in terms of how much power gain they equate to</em>.</p>
