<p>A problem has developed in this motor circuit. When the switch is turned &quot;on&quot;, the motor does not turn. It does, however, draw a lot of current (several times the normal operating current) as indicated by the ammeter:</p>

<p>Based on this information, what do you think may be wrong with the circuit? Is there anything we know for sure is <em>not</em> failed in the circuit? Explain your answers.</p>
<p>One likely cause is either the field winding or something in the armature (a brush, perhaps) failed open. Internal motor problems are not the only possibilities, however!</p>
<p>This question is an exercise in diagnostic thinking. Always challenge your students to try diagnosing the nature of a problem with the given information before taking further measurements or observations. Far too often people take more measurements than necessary to troubleshoot electrical systems, because they do not think carefully enough about what they are doing.</p>
