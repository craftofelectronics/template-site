<p>In this time-delay relay circuit, the motor will immediately start when the pushbutton is pressed, and continue to run for about 5 seconds after the pushbutton is released. The green light-emitting diode (LED) is supposed to be on whenever the motor is stopped, and off whenever the motor is running:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03534x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>However, a problem has developed with this circuit. Neither the motor nor the green LED ever energizes, no matter what is done with the pushbutton switch. Strangely enough, the relay <em>does</em> make a &quot;click&quot; sound when the pushbutton is pressed, and then another &quot;click&quot; sound about 5 seconds after the switch is released. Based on this information, determine the following:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> components or wires in the circuit that you know cannot be failed either open or shorted, besides the 24 volt source.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> components or wires in the circuit you think could possibly be bad (either one independently capable of causing the problem), and the type of failure each would be (either open or shorted).</p>
