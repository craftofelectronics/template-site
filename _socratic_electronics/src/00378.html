<p>Suppose two 50 mH inductors are connected in parallel with each other. What will their combined inductance be, in Henrys? Explain your answer.</p>
<p>25 mH</p>
<p>Ask your students this question: given capacitors and inductors, which of these component types behave more like resistors, in terms of their series versus parallel equivalent values?</p>
