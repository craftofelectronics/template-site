<p>An important use for read-only semiconductor memories is as <em>look-up tables</em>. Describe what a &quot;look-up table&quot; is, and what one might be used for.</p>
<p>A <em>look-up table</em> is a set of data programmed into a memory device, used to map a function of some kind: for each unique input (address), there is an output (data) that means something to the system in which it is installed.</p>
<p>An example of a look-up table is an EBCDIC-to-ASCII code converter, where an EBCDIC code input to the address lines of a ROM chip &quot;looks up&quot; the equivalent ASCII character value from memory, and outputs it as the result through the ROM chip’s data lines.</p>
<p>The EBCDIC-to-ASCII code converter concept is not hypothetical! I actually designed and helped build such a circuit to allow standard personal computers to &quot;talk&quot; to an obsolete CNC machine tool control computer which didn’t understand ASCII data, only EBCDIC. A look-up table implemented in a UVEPROM served as a neat way to implement this function, without a lot of complex circuitry.</p>
