<p>Calculate the resonant frequency, bandwidth, and half-power points of the following filter circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01565x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math">$f_r = 6.79 \hbox{ kHz}$</span></p>
<p>Bandwidth = 289.4 Hz</p>
<p><span class="math">$f_1 = 6.64 \hbox{ kHz}$</span></p>
<p><span class="math">$f_2 = 6.93 \hbox{ kHz}$</span></p>
<p>Follow-up question: how would a decrease in the <span class="math"><em>Q</em></span> (&quot;quality factor&quot;) of the circuit affect the bandwidth, or would it at all?</p>
<p>The formulae required to calculate these parameters are easily obtained from any basic electronics text. No student should have trouble finding this information.</p>
