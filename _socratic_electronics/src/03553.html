<p>An unfortunate tendency that many new students have is to immediately plug numbers into equations when faced with a time-constant circuit problem, before carefully considering the circuit. Explain why the following steps are very wise to follow <em>before</em> performing any mathematical calculations:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Step 1: Identify and list all the known (&quot;given&quot;) quantities.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Step 2: Draw a schematic of the circuit, if none is given to you.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Step 3: Label components in the schematic with all known quantities.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Step 4: Sketch a rough plot of how you expect the variable(s) in the circuit to change over time.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Step 5: Label starting and final values for these graphed variables, wherever possible.</p>
<p>I’ll let you discuss this question with your classmates and instructor!</p>
<p>This is advice I always give my students, after seeing so many students get themselves into trouble by blindly plugging numbers into equations. <em>Think</em> before you act, is the motto here!</p>
<p>Actually, this general advice applies to most all physics-type problems: identify what it is you’re trying to solve and what you have to work with before jumping into calculations.</p>
