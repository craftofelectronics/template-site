<p>Why is it a very bad idea to connect an ammeter directly across a voltage source, like this?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00070x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Due to the ammeter’s very low resistance, it will &quot;draw&quot; a lot of current from the voltage source. In effect, the ammeter will form a short circuit with the voltage source, potentially damaging the meter and/or the source.</p>
<p>In applications where the voltage source possesses very little internal resistance of its own, the current surge resulting from such a short-circuit may be huge. Very large surges of electric current are capable of heating wires to the point where their insulation bursts into flames, as well as causing super-heated blasts of <em>plasma</em> (electrically ionized gas) to form at any point of electrical contact where there is a spark. Either of these high-temperature conditions are hazardous to the person holding the meter and test leads!</p>
<p>An important point to discuss is how electrical safety encompasses more than just shock hazard. In particular, <em>arc blasts</em> caused by high-current &quot;faults&quot; such as this may be just as dangerous as electric shock. At the very least, placing an ammeter directly across the terminals of a voltage source will likely result in the ammeter’s fuse being blown.</p>
<p>In some cases, ammeter fuses are more expensive than one might think. Safety-rated ammeters often use expensive fast-action fuses with significant current interruption ratings. In the case of the Fluke 187 and 189 multimeters, these fuses cost around $8 each (American dollars, 2004)!</p>
