<p>Determine the phase angle (<span class="math">Θ </span>) of the current in this circuit, with respect to the supply voltage:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01853x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math">Θ  = 26. 51<sup><em>o</em></sup></span></p>
<p>Challenge question: explain how the following phasor diagram was determined for this problem:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01853x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>This is an interesting question for a couple of reasons. First, students must determine how they will measure phase shift with just the two voltage indications shown by the meters. This may present a significant challenge for some. Discuss problem-solving strategies in class so that students understand how and why it is possible to determine <span class="math">Θ </span>.</p>
<p>Secondly, this is an interesting question because it shows how something as abstract as phase angle can be measured with just a voltmeter – no oscilloscope required! Not only that, but we don’t even have to know the component values either! Note that this technique works only for simple circuits.</p>
<p>A practical point to mention here is that multimeters have frequency limits which must be considered when taking measurements on electronic circuits. Some high-quality handheld digital meters have frequency limits of hundred of kilohertz, while others fail to register accurately at only a few thousand hertz. Unless we knew these two digital voltmeters were sufficient for measuring at the signal frequency, their indications would be useless to us.</p>
