<p>If a battery and switch were connected to one end of a 10-mile long cable, and two oscilloscopes were used to record voltage at either end of the cable, how far apart in time would those two pulses be, assuming a propagation velocity equal to the speed of light (in other words, the cable has a <em>velocity factor</em> equal to 1.0)?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00127x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>53.68 microseconds</p>
<p>Students should realize by the wording of the question that the voltage signal probably does not arrive at the far end of the cable instantaneously after the switch is closed. Although the speed of light is very, very fast, it is not instant: there will be a measurable time delay.</p>
