<p>The presence of a &quot;ground&quot; wire increases the degree of electrical safety for anyone using an electrical appliance. It entails having a third &quot;prong&quot; on the power plug, connecting with a third hole on the power receptacle, which connects to a separate wire running all the way back to the power systemâ€™s grounding point:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00317x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>But why not eliminate all that extra wiring, and simply connect the third hole on the power receptacle to the &quot;neutral&quot; wire?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00317x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Why would this idea be unwise?</p>
<p>Using the neutral conductor as a safety ground is a bad idea, in the event the neutral wire were to ever fail &quot;open&quot; between the receptacle and the system ground point.</p>
<p>Discuss this particular failure scenario with your students, drawing a schematic diagram if necessary. Not only does this illustrate the importance of having a separate ground conductor, but it also shows how the neutral wire can potentially be unsafe to touch!</p>
