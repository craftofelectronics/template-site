<p>Is it safe to close the breaker between these two alternators if their output frequencies are different? Explain why or why not.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01057x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>When the frequencies of two or more AC voltage sources are different, the phase shift(s) between them are constantly changing.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: what must be done to make the two alternatorsâ€™ frequencies equal to each other?</p>
<p>Ask your students to calculate how fast the voltages from these two alternators &quot;roll&quot; in and out of phase with each other.</p>
