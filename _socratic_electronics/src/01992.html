<p>Use circuit simulation software to verify your predicted and measured parameter values.</p>
<p>Use a variable-voltage, regulated power supply to supply any amount of DC voltage below 30 volts. Specify standard resistor values, all between 1 k<span class="math">Ω </span> and 100 k<span class="math">Ω </span> (1k5, 2k2, 2k7, 3k3, 4k7, 5k1, 6k8, 10k, 22k, 33k, 39k 47k, 68k, etc.). Use a sine-wave function generator to supply an audio-frequency input signal, and make sure its amplitude isn’t set so high that the amplifier clips.</p>
<p>I have had good success using the following values:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>D</em><em>D</em></sub></span> = 9 volts</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>i</em><em>n</em></sub></span> = 1 volt (peak), <span class="math"><em>f</em></span> = 2 kHz</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>G</em></sub></span> = 100 k<span class="math">Ω </span></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>S</em></sub></span> = 10 k<span class="math">Ω </span></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math"><em>C</em><sub>1</sub></span> = 0.47 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>F</p>
<p>Please note that the quiescent output voltage is impossible to precisely predict, as it depends on the particular characteristics of the JFET used (<span class="math"><em>I</em><sub><em>D</em></sub></span> versus <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>G</em><em>S</em></sub></span>). The fact that this circuit uses self-biasing instead of voltage divider biasing makes the situation worse. Predicting quiescent gate voltage, however should be extremely easy (0 volts) if one understands how JFETs function.</p>
<p>An interesting parameter to explore in this circuit is the effect of the source resistor value on voltage gain. The theoretical voltage gain of a simple common-drain amplifier circuit is unity (1), but this may be approximated only with relatively large load resistor (<span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>S</em></sub></span>) values. Try substituting a 1 k<span class="math">Ω </span> or less resistor for <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>S</em></sub></span>, and notice what happens to the gain. Then, have your students explain why this happens!</p>
<p>An extension of this exercise is to incorporate troubleshooting questions. Whether using this exercise as a performance assessment or simply as a concept-building lab, you might want to follow up your students’ results by asking them to predict the consequences of certain circuit faults.</p>
