<p>Special safety devices called <em>Ground Fault Current Interrupters</em>, or <em>GFCIâ€™s</em>, reduce the risk of shock hazard in electrical systems even where there is no ground conductor. Explain the operating principle of a GFCI. How are they able to sense a &quot;ground fault&quot; condition, so as to automatically turn off power to a receptacle?</p>
<p>&quot;GFCI&quot; devices work on the principle of <em>differential current measurement</em> as a means to sense ground faults.</p>
<p>Be sure to discuss with your students what &quot;differential current measurement&quot; means, rather than assume they all researched the answer in greater detail than what is provided here. This really is a clever way to detect the presence of a ground fault!</p>
<p>You should point out to your students that GFCI power receptacles are commonly installed in &quot;wet&quot; areas of residences, such as in the bathroom and outside, where the hazard of ground-fault electric shock is maximized by the presence of water.</p>
<p>This question also provides an opportunity to discuss why the presence of water at a point of bodily contact increases the severity of electric shock.</p>
