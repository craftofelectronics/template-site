<p><em>Mutual inductance</em> is the term given to the phenomenon where a change in current through one inductor causes a voltage to be induced in another. When two inductors (<span class="math"><em>L</em><sub>1</sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>L</em><sub>2</sub></span>) are magnetically &quot;coupled,&quot; the mutual inductance (<span class="math"><em>M</em></span>) relates their voltages and currents as such:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$e_1 = M{di_2 \over dt} \hskip 10pt \hbox{Voltage induced in coil 1 by change of current in coil 2}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$e_2 = M{di_1 \over dt} \hskip 10pt \hbox{Voltage induced in coil 2 by change of current in coil 1}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00468x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>When the magnetic coupling between the two inductors is perfect (<span class="math"><em>k</em> = 1</span>), how does <span class="math"><em>M</em></span> relate to <span class="math"><em>L</em><sub>1</sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>L</em><sub>2</sub></span>? In other words, write an equation defining <span class="math"><em>M</em></span> in terms of <span class="math"><em>L</em><sub>1</sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>L</em><sub>2</sub></span>, given perfect coupling.</p>
<p>Hint:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$e_1 = L_2 {N_1 \over N_2} {di_2 \over dt}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$e_2 = L_1 {N_2 \over N_1} {di_1 \over dt}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">${L_1 \over L_2} = \left( {N_1 \over N_2} \right)^2$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math">$M = \sqrt{L_1 L_2}$</span></p>
<p>Challenge question: is mutual inductance expressed in the same unit of measurement that self-inductance is? Why or why not?</p>
<p>The solution to this question involves quite a bit of algebraic manipulation and substitution. Of course, it may also be found in many basic electronics textbooks, but the point of this question is for students to see how it may be derived from the equations they already know.</p>
