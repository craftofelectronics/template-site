<p>Suppose a power supply is energized by an AC source of 119 V RMS. The transformer step-down ratio is 8:1, it uses a full-wave bridge rectifier circuit with silicon diodes, and the filter is nothing but a single electrolytic capacitor. Calculate the unloaded DC output voltage for this supply (assume 0.7 volts drop across each diode). Also, write an equation solving for DC output voltage (<span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>o</em><em>u</em><em>t</em></sub></span>), given all these parameters.</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>o</em><em>u</em><em>t</em></sub> = </span> 19.6 volts</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$V_{out} = {{V_{in} \over r} \over 0.707} - 2 V_f$</span><br /></p>
<p>Where,</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>o</em><em>u</em><em>t</em></sub> = </span> DC output voltage, in volts</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>i</em><em>n</em></sub> = </span> AC input voltage, in volts RMS</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>r</em> = </span> Transformer step-down ratio</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>f</em></sub> = </span> Forward voltage drop of each diode, in volts</p>
<p>Follow-up question: algebraically manipulate this equation to solve for <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>i</em><em>n</em></sub></span>.</p>
<p>It is important for students to understand where this equation comes from. Ask your students to explain, step by step, the process of calculating output voltage for a simple power supply circuit. It is helpful in this process to calculate the voltage at each &quot;stage&quot; of the power supply (transformer primary, transformer secondary, etc.), as though we were building the circuit one component at a time.</p>
<p>Incidentally, the method of building a project (such as a power supply) in a step-by-step fashion rather than all at once, saves a lot of time and effort when things go wrong. The same &quot;step-by-step&quot; strategy works well for mathematical analysis, and other problem-solving tasks as well: try to analyze the circuit one &quot;block&quot; at a time instead of the whole thing at once.</p>
