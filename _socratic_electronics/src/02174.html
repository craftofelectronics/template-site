<p>If the power waveform is plotted for a resistive AC circuit, it will look like this:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02174x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>What is the significance of the power value always being <em>positive</em> (above the zero line) and never negative (below the zero line)?</p>
<p>Positive power represents energy flowing from the source to the (resistive) load, in this case meaning that energy never returns from the load back to the source.</p>
<p>Ask your students what it means in physical terms for energy to flow to a resistive load, and what it would mean for energy to flow from a resistive load back to the source.</p>
