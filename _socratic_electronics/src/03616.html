<p>Explain what it means for an inductor-capacitor (<span class="math"><em>L</em><em>C</em></span>) circuit to be in a state of <em>resonance</em>.</p>
<p>Resonance is that state where the inductive and capacitive reactances are precisely equal to one another:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math"><em>X</em><sub><em>L</em></sub> = <em>X</em><sub><em>C</em></sub></span><br /></p>
