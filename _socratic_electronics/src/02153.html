<p>A resistive DC load receives pulse-width modulated (PWM) power from a controller circuit, and an oscilloscope shows the load voltage waveform as such:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02153x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Calculate the duty cycle of this waveform, and also the average power dissipated by the load assuming a load resistance of 2.5 <span class="math">Ω </span>.</p>
<p>Duty cycle <span class="math"> ≈ </span> 42%</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>P</em><sub><em>a</em><em>v</em><em>e</em><em>r</em><em>a</em><em>g</em><em>e</em></sub></span> <span class="math"> ≈ </span> 1.5 W</p>
<p>Follow-up question: which oscilloscope setup parameters (vertical sensitivity, probe ratio, coupling, and timebase) are necessary for performing these calculations? Which parameters are unnecessary, and why?</p>
<p>Calculating the duty cycle should be easy. Calculating load power dissipation requires some thought. If your students do not know how to calculate average power, suggest this thought experiment: calculating power dissipation at 0% duty cycle, at 100% duty cycle, and at 50% duty cycle. The relationship between duty cycle and average power dissipation is rather intuitive if one considers these conditions.</p>
<p>If a more rigorous approach is required to satisfy student queries, you may wish to pose another thought experiment: calculate the <em>energy</em> (in units of Joules) delivered to the load for a 50% duty cycle, recalling that Watts equals Joules per second. Average power, then, is calculated by dividing Joules by seconds over a period of one or more whole waveform cycles. From this, the linear relationship between duty cycle and average power dissipation should be clear.</p>
