<p>An AC voltage source with an internal (&quot;Thévenin&quot;) resistance of 50 <span class="math">Ω </span> is connected to a step-down transformer with a winding ratio of 10:1. What is the equivalent source voltage and resistance, as seen from the load terminals?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01034x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Equivalent source voltage = 2.4 VAC; equivalent source resistance = 0.5 <span class="math">Ω </span>.</p>
<p>Ask your students to explain how they obtained the equivalent voltage and current figures for this transformer-coupled source. Is there a scenario we could imagine the source being placed in that would allow us to obtain these figures without knowing anything about transformer impedance matching?</p>
