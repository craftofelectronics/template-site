<p>What difference will it make if the battery in this circuit is reversed in direction?</p>

<p>The choice of battery &quot;polarity&quot; in a simple light bulb circuit makes no difference at all. In either case, the light bulb will energize when the switch is closed.</p>
<p>It should be noted that not all electrical loads are &quot;non-polarized&quot; like an incandescent light bulb. Some electrical components, such as <em>light-emitting diodes</em>, are polarity sensitive, and will function only if current goes through them in the proper direction.</p>
