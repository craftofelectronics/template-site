<p>Solve for the value of <span class="math"><em>x</em></span> in the following equations:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$10x = 80 \hbox{\hskip 30pt} x =$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$3 = {15 \over x} \hbox{\hskip 30pt} x =$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$10x = 80 \hbox{\hskip 30pt} x = 8$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$3 = {15 \over x} \hbox{\hskip 30pt} x = 5$</span><br /></p>
<p>Have your students come to the front of the class and show everyone else the techniques they used to solve for the value of <span class="math"><em>x</em></span> in each equation. Remind them to document each and every step in the process, so that nothing is left to guess or to chance.</p>
