<p>Sometimes a <em>feedback network</em> is purposely placed in an amplifier circuit, like the <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>f</em></sub></span>-<span class="math"><em>C</em><sub><em>f</em></sub></span> combination shown in the following schematic:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03744x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Explain what will happen to the amplifier circuit’s performance if either one of the components in this feedback network fails open.</p>
<p>The amplifier’s gain will increase, possibly to the point of distorting the signal.</p>
<p>The purpose of this question is to approach the domain of circuit troubleshooting from a perspective of knowing what the fault is, rather than only knowing what the symptoms are. Although this is not necessarily a realistic perspective, it helps students build the foundational knowledge necessary to diagnose a faulted circuit from empirical data. Questions such as this should be followed (eventually) by other questions asking students to identify likely faults based on measurements.</p>
