<p>Make a rough calculation of the power your circuitâ€™s final output transistor(s) must dissipate when carrying the full 2 amps of current. Will the power dissipation be greatest at maximum voltage (20 volts) output or minimum voltage (3 volts) output? Explain why.</p>
<p>The answer to this question may surprise you, being somewhat nonintuitive. You may find that power dissipation is the most significant technical challenge to overcome in this circuit design: how to ensure your circuit will not be damaged by excessive heat.</p>
<p>Having students recognize this design problem and engineer solutions to it is very important part of this project, and it will greatly enhance their practical understanding of transistor circuits as well!</p>
