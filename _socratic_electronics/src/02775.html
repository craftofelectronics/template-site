<p>In ladder logic diagrams, a normally-open relay contact is drawn as a set of parallel lines, almost like a non-polarized capacitor in an electronic schematic diagram. Normally-closed relay contacts differ in symbolism by having a diagonal line drawn through them.</p>
<p>Analyze the following relay logic circuit, completing the truth table accordingly:</p>

<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02775x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Many students find the &quot;line-through-the-contact&quot; a very intuitive way to represent normally-closed relay contacts. Be sure to emphasize that the diagonal line, as well as the name <em>normally</em>-closed, does not refer to any given state of the contact, but rather to the contactâ€™s <em>resting</em> state when the relay coil is de-energized. I have seen teachers put a diagonal line through a relay contact symbol on a ladder logic diagram to indicate the state of the contact being closed by energization of the coil, during the process of explaining how a circuit functioned. This is wrong, as it confuses the concept of contacts being normally-closed with the concept of contacts simply being (energized) closed.</p>
