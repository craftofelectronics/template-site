<p>Explain the meaning of the digital lines A, B, F, and S in the following schematic diagram:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02848x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Lines A, B, and F (with the slash marks and the number &quot;4&quot;) represent four actual conductors, carrying four bits of digital information. The thick line (S) is also a four-bit &quot;bus&quot; but is denoted by a slightly different convention.</p>
<p>In case you were wondering, it is unusual to mix two different bus symbol conventions in the same schematic diagram. I show this here only for your benefit, to see that there is more than one &quot;standard&quot; way to draw it.</p>
<p>The answer pretty much says it all. The fact that the IC is an ALU is quite incidental. Some students may research the part number to get a better understanding of what is going on. That is fine, but my emphasis in this question is the schematic diagram convention(s) for multi-conductor busses.</p>
