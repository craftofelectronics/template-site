<p>Find a piece of wire or electrical cable and bring it with you to class for discussion. Identify as much information as you can about your conductor prior to discussion:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Gauge</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Ampacity</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Voltage rating of insulation</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Temperature rating of insulation</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Insulation type (plastic, Teflon, silicone, etc.)</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Insulation service (conduit, wireway, direct burial, etc.)</p>
<p>If possible, find a manufacturer’s datasheet for your type of wire to discuss with your classmates.</p>
<p>The purpose of this question is to get students to kinesthetically interact with the subject matter. It may seem silly to have students engage in a &quot;show and tell&quot; exercise, but I have found that activities such as this greatly help some students. For those learners who are kinesthetic in nature, it is a great help to actually <em>touch</em> real components while they’re learning about their function. Of course, this question also provides an excellent opportunity for them to practice interpreting component markings, use a multimeter, access datasheets, etc.</p>
