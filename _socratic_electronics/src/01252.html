<p>A student builds the following digital circuit on a solderless breadboard (a &quot;proto-board&quot;):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01252x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The DIP circuit is a TTL hex inverter (it contains <em>six</em> &quot;inverter&quot; or &quot;NOT&quot; logic gates), but only one of these gates is being used in this circuit. The student’s intent was to build a logic circuit that energized the LED when the pushbutton switch was unactuated, and de-energized the LED when the switch was pressed: so that the LED indicated the reverse state of the switch itself. However, in reality the LED fails to energize no matter what state the switch is in.</p>
<p>First question: how would you use a multimeter as a logic probe to check the logic states of points in this circuit, in order to troubleshoot it?</p>
<p>Second question: suppose you checked the logic states of pin #1 on the IC, for both states of the switch (pressed and unpressed), and found that pin #1 was always &quot;high&quot;. How does this measurement indicate the student’s design flaw in this circuit? How would you recommend this design flaw be corrected?</p>
<p>To use a multimeter as a logic probe, connect the common (black) test lead to the power supply ground, set the meter to measure DC voltage (a 0-5 volt scale would be perfect in this application), and then use the other test lead (red) to probe the various points of the circuit.</p>
<p>The problem with this student’s circuit is the input switch: it does not provide a solid &quot;low&quot; state when open. Rather, the inverter’s input is left &quot;floating&quot; when the switch is unactuated. There is more than one way to fix this design flaw, but I’ll leave the details up to you!</p>
<p>Discuss the problem of &quot;floating&quot; or &quot;high-Z&quot; states with your students. It is always a good idea to eliminate ambiguous logic states such as this in the circuits you build.</p>
