<p>One style of light bulb, very different from the &quot;incandescent&quot; design which works on the principle of a super-heated wire filament emitting light, is called a <em>gas discharge tube</em>. In this design of light bulb, light is produced by the direct &quot;excitation&quot; of gas molecules as electric current passes between two electrodes:</p>

<p>Both types of light bulbs have interesting voltage/current plots, neither one being identical to the voltage/current plot of a resistor. First, the voltage/current plot for an incandescent light bulb:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00091x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Next, the voltage/current plot for a gas-discharge light bulb:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00091x03.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Based on these two graphs, what can you say about the electrical resistance of each bulb type over its operating range?</p>
<p>Unlike a resistor, which offers a relatively fixed (unchanging) amount of resistance to the motion of electrons over a wide range of operating conditions, the electrical resistance of light bulbs typically change dramatically over their respective operating ranges.</p>
<p>From the graphs, determine where the resistance for each type of light bulb is at its <em>maximum</em>, and where the resistance is at its <em>minimum</em>.</p>
<p>Many types of electrical and electronic components experience changes in electrical resistance over their operating ranges of current and voltage. Resistors, while simple to study, do not exhibit the behavior of most electronic components. It is important for students to understand that the real world of electricity and electronics is much more complex than what Ohmâ€™s Law might suggest (with an implicit assumption of fixed resistance). This is one concept that graphs really help to illustrate.</p>
