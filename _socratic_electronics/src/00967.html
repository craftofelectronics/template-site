<p>Explain how you could <em>measure</em> the AC voltage gain of a functioning Class A amplifier circuit, as opposed to <em>predicting</em> its gain from known component values.</p>
<p>Measuring input and output voltage with an AC voltmeter or oscilloscope:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$A_V = {V_{out} \over V_{in}}$</span><br /></p>
<p>This skill is important if students are to build amplifier circuits and empirically compare their performance against predicted results.</p>
