<p>Observe the following equivalence:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">${4^2 \over 4^3} = {{4 \times 4} \over {4 \times 4 \times 4}}$</span><br /></p>
<p>It should be readily apparent that we may cancel out two quantities from both top and bottom of the fraction, so in the end we are left with this:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$1 \over 4$</span><br /></p>
<p>Following the rule of <span class="math">${a^m \over a^n} = a^{m-n}$</span>, the reduction of <span class="math">${4^2 \over 4^3}$</span> should be <span class="math">4<sup> − 1</sup></span>. Many students find this confusing, as the intuitive concept of exponents (how many times a number is to be multiplied by itself) fails here. How in the world do we multiply 4 by itself -1 times?!</p>
<p>Expand each of these expressions so that there are no exponents either:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math">${3^2 \over 3^5} = $</span></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math">${10^4 \over 10^6} = $</span></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math">${8^3 \over 8^7} = $</span></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math">${20^4 \over 20^5} = $</span></p>
<p>After expanding each of these expressions, re-write each one in simplest form: one number to a power, just like the final form of the example given (<span class="math">4<sup> − 1</sup></span>), following the rule <span class="math">${a^m \over a^n} = a^{m-n}$</span>. From these examples, what easy-to-understand definition can you think of to describe negative exponents?</p>
<p>Also, expand the following expression so there are no exponents, then re-write the result in exponent form following the rule <span class="math">${a^m \over a^n} = a^{m-n}$</span>:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$5^3 \over 5^3$</span><br /></p>
<p>What does this tell you about exponents of zero?</p>
<p>A negative exponent is simply the reciprocal (<span class="math">1 / <em>x</em></span>) of its positive counterpart. A zero exponent is always equal to 1.</p>
<p>I have found that students who cannot fathom the meaning of negative or zero exponents often understand immediately when they construct their own definition based on the general rule (<span class="math">${a^m \over a^n} = a^{m-n}$</span>).</p>
