<p>Shown here is a circuit constructed on a PCB (a &quot;Printed Circuit Board&quot;), with copper &quot;traces&quot; serving as wires to connect the components together:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00099x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>How would the multimeter be used to measure the resistance of the component labeled &quot;R1&quot;? Include these important points in your answer:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> The configuration of the multimeter (selector switch position, test lead jacks)</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> The connections of the meter test leads to the circuit</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> The state of the switch on the PCB (open or closed)</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00099x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>It is very important that students understand component resistance cannot be measured when the component is energized! In cases such as this, it is necessary to disconnect the component from the rest of the circuit so that only <em>its</em> resistance (and not any other components’ resistance) is measured. In other cases, though, it may be acceptable to leave the component in place to take a resistance measurement.</p>
