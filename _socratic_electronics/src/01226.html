<p>In an eight-bit digital system, where all numbers are represented in two’s complement form, what is the largest (most positive) quantity that may be represented with those eight bits? What is the smallest (most negative) quantity that may be represented? Express your answers in both binary (two’s complement) and decimal form.</p>
<p>Largest (most positive): <span class="math">01111111<sub>2</sub></span> = <span class="math">127<sub>10</sub></span></p>
<p>Smallest (most negative): <span class="math">10000000<sub>2</sub></span> = <span class="math"> − 128<sub>10</sub></span></p>
<p>The most important concept in this question is that of <em>range</em>: what are the limits of the representable quantities, given a certain number of bits. Two’s complement just makes the concept a bit more interesting.</p>
