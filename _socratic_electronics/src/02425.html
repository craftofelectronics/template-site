<p>Use circuit simulation software to verify your predicted and measured parameter values.</p>
<p>I recommend a value for R1 of 1 M<span class="math">Ω </span> or more, to show that the bleed resistor need not be very conductive to do its job well. The students will calculate their own dropping resistor value, based on the supply voltage and the LED ratings.</p>
<p>Students predict the LED current (approximately 20 mA) and the switch current (0 mA), and then calculate the transistor’s &quot;on&quot; channel resistance and power dissipation after taking additional measurements. I expect students to be able to figure out how to calculate both these parameters without being told what measurements to take!</p>
