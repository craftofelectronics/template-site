<p>Ideally, an amplifier circuit increases the amplitude of a signal without altering the signal’s wave-shape in the least. Realistically, though, amplifiers always exhibit some degree of distortion.</p>
<p>Describe how harmonic analysis – either with a spectrum analyzer or some other piece of test equipment capable of measuring harmonics in a signal – is used to quantify the distortion of an amplifier circuit.</p>
<p>A pure sine wave is input to the amplifier under test, and a spectrum analyzer is connected to the amplifier’s output.</p>
<p>The answer given is purposefully vague. All I did is describe what gets connected to the amplifier, not how to interpret the measurements. Ask your students to explain <em>why</em> a pure sine wave is chosen as the test signal, and what sort of response would be considered ideal to see on the spectrum analyzer.</p>
