<p>The flip-flop circuit shown here is classified as <em>synchronous</em> because both flip-flops receive clock pulses at the exact same time:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01385x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Define the following parameters:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Set-up time</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Hold time</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Propagation delay time</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Minimum clock pulse duration</p>
<p>Then, explain how each of these parameters is relevant in the circuit shown.</p>
<p>The clock frequency must be slow enough that there is adequate <em>set-up time</em> before the next clock pulse. The <em>propagation delay time</em> of FF1 must also be larger than the <em>hold time</em> of FF2. And, of course, the pulse width of the clock signal must be long enough for both flip-flops to reliably &quot;clock.&quot;</p>
<p>I could have simply asked students to define the terms, but where’s the fun in that? Seriously, though, these concepts will make far more sense to students when they are viewed in a practical context. After all, the whole purpose of teaching these concepts is so students will be able to <em>apply</em> them, right?</p>
