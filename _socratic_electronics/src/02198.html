<p>Suppose a set of three neon light bulbs were connected to an alternator with three sets of windings labeled <strong>A</strong>, <strong>B</strong>, and <strong>C</strong>:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02198x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The schematic diagram for this alternator/lamp system is as follows:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02198x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>If the alternator spins fast enough (clockwise, as shown), the AC voltage induced in its windings will be enough to cause the neon lamps to &quot;blink&quot; (neon bulbs have very fast reaction times and thus cannot maintain a glow for very long without current, unlike incandescent lamps which operate on the principle of a glowing-hot metal filament). Most likely this blinking will be too fast to discern with the naked eye.</p>
<p>However, if we were to videorecord the blinking and play back the recording at a slow speed, we should be able to see the sequence of light flashes. Determine the apparent &quot;direction&quot; of the lampsâ€™ blinking (from right-to-left or from left-to-right), and relate that sequence to the voltage peaks of each alternator coil pair.</p>
<p>The lamps will blink from left to right (<strong>C</strong>-<strong>B</strong>-<strong>A</strong>-<strong>C</strong>-<strong>B</strong>-<strong>A</strong>).</p>
<p>Follow-up question: suppose lamp <strong>B</strong> stopped blinking, while lamps <strong>A</strong> and <strong>C</strong> continued. Identify at least two possible causes for this failure.</p>
<p>This question is really a prelude to discussing <em>phase rotation</em> in polyphase systems.</p>
