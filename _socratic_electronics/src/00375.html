<p>Many precision resistors utilize a <em>wire-wound</em> construction, where the resistance is determined by the type and length of wire wrapped around a spool. This form of construction allows for high precision of resistance, with low temperature sensitivity if certain metal alloys are used for the wire.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, though, wrapping wire around a spool forms a coil, which will naturally possess a significant amount of inductance. This is generally undesirable, as we would like to have resistors possessing <em>only resistance</em>, with no &quot;parasitic&quot; properties.</p>
<p>There is, however, a special way in which a wire coil may be wound so as to have almost no inductance. This method is called <em>bifilar</em> winding, and it is common in wire-wound resistor construction. Describe how bifilar winding works, and why it eliminates parasitic inductance.</p>
<p>I won’t directly describe how a bifilar winding is made, but I’ll give you a hint. Compare the inductance of a straight piece of wire, versus one that is folded in half:</p>

<p>Now, how could a non-inductive <em>coil</em> of wire be made using the same principle?</p>
<p>This technique is very useful in reducing or eliminating parasitic inductance. Typically, parasitic inductance is not a problem unless very high rates of current change are involved, such as in high-frequency AC circuits (radio, high-speed digital logic, etc.). In such applications, knowing how to control stray inductance is very important to proper circuit operation.</p>
