<p>Define what &quot;derivative&quot; means when applied to the graph of a function. For instance, examine this graph:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03646x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Label all the points where the derivative of the function (<span class="math">$dy \over dx$</span>) is positive, where it is negative, and where it is equal to zero.</p>
<p>The graphical interpretation of &quot;derivative&quot; means the <em>slope</em> of the function at any given point.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03646x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Usually students find the concept of the derivative easiest to understand in graphical form: being the <em>slope</em> of the graph. This is true whether or not the independent variable is time (an important point given that most &quot;intuitive&quot; examples of the derivative are time-based!).</p>
