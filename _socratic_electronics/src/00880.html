<p>Many op-amp circuits require a <em>dual</em> or <em>split</em> power supply, consisting of three power terminals: +V, -V, and Ground. Draw the necessary connections between the 6-volt batteries in this schematic diagram to provide +12 V, -12 V, and Ground to this op-amp:</p>

<p>I encourage your students to learn how to power op-amp circuits with interconnected batteries, because it really helps to build their understanding of what a &quot;split&quot; power supply is, as well as allow them to build functioning op-amp circuits in the absence of a quality benchtop power supply.</p>
