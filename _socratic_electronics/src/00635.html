<p>Engineers often write the capacitive and inductive reactance formulae in a different way from what you may have seen:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math"><em>X</em><sub><em>L</em></sub> = <em>ω</em><em>L</em></span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$X_C = {1 \over {\omega C}}$</span><br /></p>
<p>These equations should look familiar to you, from having seen similar equations containing a term for frequency (<span class="math"><em>f</em></span>). Given these equations’ forms, what is the mathematical definition of <span class="math"><em>ω</em></span>? In other words, what combination of variables and constants comprise &quot;<span class="math"><em>ω</em></span>&quot;, and what unit is it properly expressed in?</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>ω</em> = 2<em>π</em><em>f</em></span>, and it is expressed in units of <em>radians per second</em>.</p>
<p>Students who have taken trigonometry should recognize the <em>radian</em> as a unit for measuring angles. Discuss with your students why multiplying frequency (<span class="math"><em>f</em></span>, cycles per second) by the constant <span class="math">2<em>π</em></span> results in the unit changing to &quot;radians per second&quot;.</p>
<p>Engineers often refer to <span class="math"><em>ω</em></span> as the <em>angular velocity</em> of an AC system. Discuss why the term &quot;velocity&quot; is appropriate for <span class="math"><em>ω</em></span>.</p>
