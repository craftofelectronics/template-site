<p>Examine this push-pull audio amplifier circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01126x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Answer the following questions about this circuit based on your analysis of it:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> How is phase splitting accomplished in this circuit?</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> What is the purpose of resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span>?</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> What would happen if resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> failed open?</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> What would happen if the wire connecting the base of transistor <span class="math"><em>Q</em><sub>2</sub></span> to the input transformer (<span class="math"><em>T</em><sub>1</sub></span>) were to fail open?</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> The input transformer <span class="math"><em>T</em><sub>1</sub></span> provides phase splitting.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> establishes the Q point of both transistors.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> If <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> failed open, both transistors would go into cutoff mode.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> If the wire connecting the base of transistor <span class="math"><em>Q</em><sub>2</sub></span> to the input transformer (<span class="math"><em>T</em><sub>1</sub></span>) were to fail open, one-half of the output waveform would become clipped.</p>
<p>Ask your students to give detailed reasons for their answers. The answers provided for this question are minimal – it is your job as the instructor to ensure students are <em>thinking</em> their way through this question, and not just repeating something they’ve read or heard from others.</p>
