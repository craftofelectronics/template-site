<p>Just as electricity may be harnessed to produce magnetism, magnetism may also be harnessed to produce electricity. The latter process is known as <em>electromagnetic induction</em>. Design a simple experiment to explore the phenomenon of electromagnetic induction.</p>
<p>Perhaps the easiest way to demonstrate electromagnetic induction is to build a simple circuit formed from a coil of wire and a sensitive electrical meter (a digital meter is preferred for this experiment), then move a magnet past the wire coil. You should notice a direct correlation between the position of the magnet relative to the coil over time, and the amount of voltage or current indicated by the meter.</p>
<p>Many students improperly assume that electromagnetic induction may take place in the presence of <em>static</em> magnetic fields. This is not true. The simple experimental setup described in the &quot;Answer&quot; section for this question is sufficient to dispel that myth, and to illuminate studentsâ€™ understanding of this principle. Incidentally, this activity is a great way to get students started thinking in calculus terms: relating one variable to the <em>rate of change over time</em> of another variable.</p>
