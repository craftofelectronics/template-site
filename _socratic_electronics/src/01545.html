<p>What is the difference between <em>white noise</em> and <em>pink noise</em>?</p>
<p>White noise in the audio range is generally considered to be pleasing to the human ear. Identify one source of &quot;white&quot; noise that anyone can readily experience for themselves.</p>
<p>The difference has to do with the distribution of noise amplitude compared to noise frequency. Hint: compare red-colored light with &quot;white&quot; light.</p>
<p>With regard to white noise, <em>everyone</em> has heard it at least one in their lives, but most people don’t know what to call it!</p>
<p>Explain to your students that other colors are used to categorize spectral distributions of different noise types:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Purple = <span class="math"><em>f</em><sup>2</sup></span> (directly proportional to square of frequency)</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Blue = <span class="math"><em>f</em></span> (directly proportional to frequency)</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> White = 1 (constant amplitude)</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Pink = <span class="math">1 / <em>f</em></span> (inversely proportional to frequency)</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Red/Brown = <span class="math">1 / <em>f</em><sup>2</sup></span> (inversely proportional to square of frequency)</p>
<p>And, of course, there are such noises that do not neatly fall into any of these categories.</p>
<p>For a good overview of electrical noise, consult Texas Instruments’ online manual, <em>Op Amps For Everyone</em>, sections 10-1 through 10-12.</p>
