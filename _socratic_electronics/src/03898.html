<p>Examine these checkplot images from a PCB drafting program, for a control board based on this inverter circuit design. Both the top and bottom copper layer plots are shown from the perspective of the board’s top side. The six large &quot;pads&quot; around the periphery of the board are actually holes for mounting screws:</p>

<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03898x03.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\hbox{\bf Top copper layer}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03898x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\hbox{\bf Bottom copper layer}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03898x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Mark where discrete components (resistors, capacitors, and diodes) go into the PCB, and identify which integrated circuits on the board layout are performing which functions in the schematic. Note: the square pad on each IC marks pin number 1.</p>
<p>I’ll let you do the work on this one. Discuss your answers with your classmates!</p>
<p>This is an exercise in datasheet research and layout tracing. One potentially confusing aspect of the PCB shown is that I have a diode placed in the circuit for &quot;idiot-proofing&quot; in the event of reverse power supply connections.</p>
<p>In case you were wondering, the reason IC part numbers appear on the &quot;top copper&quot; checkplot even though silkscreening is not shown is because I actually wrote the part numbers as part of the copper layer. This was done purely for purposes of economy: my PCB supplier offers a &quot;bare bones&quot; deal with no silkscreening capability, and I still wanted to have IC labels on my boards.</p>
