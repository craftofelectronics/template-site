<p>Use circuit simulation software to verify your predicted and actual truth tables.</p>
<p>The choice of diodes is not critical in a circuit where the inputs come from manually actuated switches. Neither is the choice of resistor sizes (10 k<span class="math">Ω </span>) works just fine, especially when the only thing loading the output is the student’s logic probe or voltmeter.</p>
