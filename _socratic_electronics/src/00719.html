<p>What is a <em>galvanometer</em>? How might you build your own galvanometer from commonly available components?</p>
<p>There are several sources of information on galvanometers, both historical and modern. I leave it to you to do the research and present your findings.</p>
<p>It is possible to make a crude galvanometer from a large audio speaker, using the voice coil/cone assembly as the moving element. Using a small laser and a mirror, it should be easy to construct a light-beam galvanometer, for greater sensitivity. This could be a fun and educational classroom experiment!</p>
