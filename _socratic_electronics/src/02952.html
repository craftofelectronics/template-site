<p>Here is an eight-bit counter comprised of two four-bit 74HCT163 synchronous binary counters cascaded together:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02952x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Explain how this counter circuit works, and also determine which output bit is the LSB and which is the MSB.</p>
<p>Now, examine this eight-bit counter comprised of the same two ICs:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02952x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Explain how this counter circuit works, and how its operation differs from the previous eight-bit counter circuit.</p>
<p>The first circuit shows two four-bit counters cascaded together in a <em>ripple</em> fashion. The second circuit shows the same two four-bit counters cascaded in a <em>synchronous</em> fashion. In both cases, <span class="math"><em>Q</em><sub>0</sub></span> of the left counter is the LSB and <span class="math"><em>Q</em><sub>3</sub></span> of the right counter is the MSB.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: comment on which method of cascading is preferred for this type of counter IC. Is the functional difference between the two circuits significant enough to warrant concern?</p>
<p>It is important for students to consult the datasheet for the 74HCT163 counter circuit in order to fully understand what is going on in these two cascaded counter circuits.</p>
