<p>The following graph is a family of characteristic curves for a particular transistor:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02246x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Superimpose on that graph a load line for the following common-emitter amplifier circuit using the same transistor:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02246x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Also determine some bias resistor values (<span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span>) that will cause the Q-point to rest approximately mid-way on the load line.</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> = <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span> =</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02246x03.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>There are several pairs of resistor values that will work adequately to position the Q-point at the center of the load line. I leave this an an exercise for you to work through and discuss with your classmates!</p>
<p>Follow-up question: determine what would happen to the Q-point if resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span> (the 2.2 k<span class="math">Ω </span> biasing resistor) were to fail open.</p>
<p>This is a very practical question, as technicians and engineers alike need to choose proper biasing so their amplifier circuits will operate in the intended class (A, in this case). There is more than one proper answer for the resistor values, so be sure to have your students share their solutions with the whole class so that many options may be explored.</p>
