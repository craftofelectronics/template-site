<p>Explain the difference between a <em>ripple adder</em> and a <em>look-ahead</em> adder. What does the term &quot;ripple&quot; mean in this context? Why is &quot;ripple&quot; potentially a bad thing for a digital adder circuit?</p>
<p>&quot;Ripple&quot; adders update their output bits one at a time rather than simultaneously. This leads to false, transient output states.</p>
<p>The &quot;ripple&quot; effect seen in simple binary adder circuits is not limited to adders! Some Gray-to-binary code converters and counter circuits also exhibit ripple, with the same deleterious effects.</p>
