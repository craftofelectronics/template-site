<p>Calculate the total capacitance in this collection of capacitors, as measured between the two wires:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00205x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>132.998 pF</p>
<p>Follow-up question: suppose one of the terminal blockâ€™s hold-down screws were to come loose on one of the leads for the middle capacitor, making a bad (open) connection. What effect would this have on the total capacitance?</p>
<p>It is most helpful to first draw a schematic diagram for this capacitor network before trying to perform any capacitance calculations, in order that a clear understanding of the series/parallel connections be established.</p>
