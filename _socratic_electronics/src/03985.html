<p>A very common accessory for oscilloscopes is a <span class="math"> × </span>10 probe, which effectively acts as a 10:1 voltage divider for any measured signals. Thus, an oscilloscope showing a waveform with a peak-to-peak amplitude of 4 divisions, with a vertical sensitivity setting of 1 volt per division, using a <span class="math"> × </span>10 probe, would actually be measuring a signal of <em>40 volts</em> peak-peak:</p>

<p>Obviously, one use for a <span class="math"> × </span>10 probe is measuring voltages beyond the normal range of an oscilloscope. However, there is another application that is less obvious, and it regards the input impedance of the oscilloscope. A <span class="math"> × </span>10 probe gives the oscilloscope 10 times more input impedance (as seen from the probe tip to ground). Typically this means an input impedance of 10 M<span class="math">Ω </span> (with the <span class="math"> × </span>10 probe) rather than 1 M<span class="math">Ω </span> (with a normal 1:1 probe). Identify an application where this feature could be useful.</p>
<p>I won’t give away an answer here, but I will provide a hint in the form of another question: why is it generally a good thing for voltmeters to have high input impedance? Or conversely, what bad things might happen if you tried to use a low-impedance voltmeter to measure voltages?</p>
<p>Increased input impedance is often a more common reason for choosing <span class="math"> × </span>10 probes, as opposed to increased voltage measurement range. The answer to this question is more readily grasped by students after they have worked with loading-sensitive electronic circuits.</p>
