<p>Define the following terms:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Ferromagnetic</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Paramagnetic</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Diamagnetic</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Ferromagnetic: easily magnetized</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Paramagnetic: only slightly magnetic</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Diamagnetic: repels magnetic fields</p>
<p>Ask your students to give examples of a few ferromagnetic materials. This should be quite easy.</p>
<p>An interesting point of trivia to bring up in discussion is that oxygen, even in its gaseous state, is paramagnetic. This principle is exploited in the design of some oxygen concentration analyzer equipment, which measure oxygen content by measuring the amount of force generated by a tiny glass container filled with a solution to be sampled!</p>
