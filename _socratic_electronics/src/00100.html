<p>The circuit shown here is called a &quot;bridge rectifier,&quot; and its purpose is to convert alternating current (from the &quot;power-supply&quot; unit) into direct current. Suppose you were instructed to check the continuity of the switch (SW1) mounted on the printed circuit board. What would be a fast and effective way of testing this switch’s continuity (ideally, without removing the switch from the circuit board)?</p>

<p>Disconnect the power supply from the circuit board (only one wire need be disconnected), and then use an ohmmeter to measure continuity across the switch terminals when in the &quot;ON&quot; position and when in the &quot;OFF&quot; position. Incidentally, this is not the only way to check the switch’s continuity, but it is the most direct.</p>
<p>Challenge your students to think of other methods which could be used to check the switch’s continuity. There is often more than one way to perform a certain check of component function, if you are knowledgeable in electrical theory and creative in your use of test equipment!</p>
