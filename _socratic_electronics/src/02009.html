<p>A common sub-circuit in power supplies of all kinds is an <em>EMI/RFI</em> filter. This LC network is all but &quot;transparent&quot; to the 50 or 60 Hz power line frequency, so that the transformer sees full line voltage at all times:</p>

<p>If this EMI/RFI filter does nothing to or with the line power, what purpose does it serve?</p>
<p>An EMI/RFI filter has no purpose in the process of converting AC power into DC power. It does, however, help prevent the power supply circuitry from interfering with <em>other</em> equipment energized by the same AC line power, by filtering out unwanted high-frequency noise generated within the power supply by diode switching.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: calculate the total inductive reactance posed by the two inductors to 60 Hz power if the inductance of each is 100 <span class="math"><em>Î¼</em></span>H.</p>
<p>These filters are very common in switch-mode power supplies, but they are not out of place in linear (&quot;brute-force&quot;) power supply circuits such as this one. Mention to your students how the abatement of electromagnetic and radio frequency interference is a high priority in all kinds of electronic device design.</p>
