<p>Research the FCC (Federal Communication Commission) guidelines on low-power radio transmitters requiring no licenses. Determine what the maximum power output is, frequency range(s), antenna lengths, transmission time, and any other restrictions relevant to building a small transmitter circuit.</p>
<p>I cannot answer the question here, as FCC guidelines are subject to change.</p>
<p>This will be an interesting topic for you and your students to explore as they begin to design their transmitter circuits. In fact, it should be the very first step in the design process!</p>
