<p>A picture is worth a thousand words, they say. For me, this illustration is the one that finally made transistors make sense to me. By forward-biasing the emitter-base junction, minority carriers are injected into the base (electrons in the &quot;P&quot; type material, in the case of an NPN transistor), which then fall easily into the collector region. This energy diagram is invaluable for explaining why collector current can flow even when the base-collector junction is reverse biased.</p>
