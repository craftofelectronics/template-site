<p>What difference will it make if the switch is located in either of these two alternate locations in the circuit?</p>

<p>The choice of switch locations shown in the two alternate diagrams makes no difference at all. In either case, the switch exerts the same control over the light bulb.</p>
<p>This is a difficult concept for some students to master. Make sure they all understand the nature of electrical current and the importance of continuity <em>throughout</em> the entire circuit. Perhaps the best way for students to master this concept is to actually build working battery-switch-lamp circuits. Remind them that their &quot;research&quot; of these worksheet questions is not limited to book reading. It is not only valid, but <em>preferable</em> for them to experiment on their own, so long as the voltages are low enough that no shock hazard exists.</p>
<p>One analogy to use for the switchâ€™s function that makes sense with the schematic is a drawbridge: when the bridge is down (closed), cars may cross; when the bridge is up (open), cars cannot.</p>
