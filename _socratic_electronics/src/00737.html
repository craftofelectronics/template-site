<p>If a set of six electromagnet coils were spaced around the periphery of a circle and energized by 3-phase AC power, what would a magnetic compass do that was placed in the center?</p>

<p>Hint: imagine the electromagnets were light bulbs instead, and the frequency of the AC power was slow enough to see each light bulb cycle in brightness, from fully dark to fully bright and back again. What would the pattern of lights appear to do?</p>
<p>The compass needle would rotate.</p>
<p>Challenge question: what would happen to the apparent motion of the magnetic field if one of the phases (either 1, 2, or 3) were to fail, so that none of the coils with that number would ever energize?</p>
<p>The concept of the rotating magnetic field is central to AC motor theory, so it is imperative that students grasp this concept before moving on to more advanced concepts. If you happen to have a string of blinking &quot;Christmas lights&quot; to use as a prop in illustrating a rotating magnetic field, this would be a good thing to show your students during discussion time.</p>
