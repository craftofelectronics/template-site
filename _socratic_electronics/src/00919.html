<p>How is it possible to determine the polarity of a rectifying diode (which terminal is the anode, and which terminal is the cathode) from its physical appearance?</p>
<p>I’ll give you a hint: there is a stripe (similar to a color band on a resistor) closer to one end of the diode than the other!</p>
<p>The answer to this question, if not found in a book, may be easily determined by direct experimentation. I recommend students verify information about electronics through experimentation whenever possible, and not rely solely on someone else’s documentation.</p>
