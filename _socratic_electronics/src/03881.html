<p>Multi-stage amplifiers may be <em>direct-coupled</em>, <em>capacitor-coupled</em>, or <em>transformer-coupled</em>. Explain why different forms of stage-to-stage coupling matters. In other words, identify at least one reason why a designer would choose one form of coupling over the other in their amplifier circuit.</p>
<p>Only <em>direct-coupled</em> amplifiers can pass DC signals through from the input to the output. <em>Capacitor-</em> and <em>transformer-coupled</em> amplifiers are immune to DC bias shifts in the input signal.</p>
