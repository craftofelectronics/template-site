<p>What positions do the switches have to be in for the light bulb to receive power?</p>

<p>For the light bulb to be energized, both switches must either be in the &quot;up&quot; position, or in the &quot;down&quot; position.</p>
<p>This wiring arrangement (&quot;three-way&quot; switches) is commonly used in residential lighting, for controlling a light bulb in a hallway with switches at either end. Once students relate this circuit to personal experience, it usually makes a lot more sense to them.</p>
