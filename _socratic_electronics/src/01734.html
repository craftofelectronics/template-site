<p>A quantity often useful in electric circuit analysis is <em>conductance</em>, defined as the reciprocal of resistance:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$G = {1 \over R}$</span><br /></p>
<p>In a series circuit, resistance increases and conductance decreases with the addition of more resistors:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01734x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Describe what happens to total resistance and total conductance with the addition of <em>parallel</em> resistors:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01734x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>When successive resistors are connected in parallel, total resistance <em>decreases</em> while total conductance <em>increases</em>.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: what is the exact formula that describes total conductance in a network of parallel conductances?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$G_{total} = \hbox{ ???}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Once students recognize the mathematical relationship between resistance and conductance (<span class="math">$G = {1 \over R}$</span>), and they realize that parallel conductances add just like series resistances add, it is but a short exercise in algebra to develop the parallel resistance formula (<span class="math">$R_{parallel} = {1 \over { {1 \over R_1} + {1 \over R_2} + \cdots {1 \over R_n} } }$</span>).</p>
