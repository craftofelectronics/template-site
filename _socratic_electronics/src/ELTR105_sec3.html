<p>When learning the relationships between voltage and current for inductors and capacitors, one must think in terms of how fast a variable is changing. The amount of voltage induced across an inductor is proportional to how <em>quickly</em> the current through it changes, not how strong the current is. Likewise, the amount of current &quot;through&quot; a capacitor is proportional to how <em>quickly</em> the voltage across it changes. This is the first hurdle in calculus: to comprehend what a rate of change is, and it is not obvious.</p>
<p>How inductors add and diminish in series and parallel (respectively) is easy to grasp because it resembles the relationships for resistors. Capacitors are &quot;backwards&quot; to both resistors and inductors, though, which causes confusion.</p>
<p>The best way I know how to overcome this confusion is to relate the series or parallel connection of capacitors to changes in physical dimension for a theoretical capacitor, and ask what change in capacitance such a change in dimension will yield. Connecting capacitors in series may be modeled by increasing the distance between plates of a theoretical capacitor, decreasing capacitance. Connecting capacitors in parallel is analogous to increasing the plate area of a theoretical capacitor, increasing capacitance.</p>
<p>Many students find the time-constant equation difficult because it involves exponents, particularly exponents of Euler’s constant <span class="math"><em>e</em></span>. This exponent is often expressed as a negative quantity, making it even more difficult to understand. The single most popular mathematical mistake I see students make with this equation is failing to properly follow algebraic order of operations. Some students try to overcome this weakness by using calculators which allow parenthetical entries, nesting parentheses in such a way that the calculator performs the proper order of operations. However, if you don’t understand order of operations yourself, you will not know where to properly place the parentheses. If you have trouble with algebraic order of operations, there is no solution but to invest the necessary time and learn it!</p>
<p>Beyond mathematical errors, though, the most common mistake I see students make with the time constant equation is mis-application. One version of this equation expresses increasing quantities, while another version expresses decreasing quantities. You must already know what the variables are going to do in your time-constant circuit before you know which equation to use! You must also be able to recognize one version of this equation from the other: not by memory, lest you should forget; but by noting what the result of the equation does as time (<span class="math"><em>t</em></span>) increases. Here again there will be trouble if you are not adept applying algebraic order of operations.</p>
