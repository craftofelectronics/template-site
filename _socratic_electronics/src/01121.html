<p>This two-stage transistor amplifier circuit is <em>transformer-coupled</em>:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01121x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>What advantage(s) does a transformer-coupled amplifier have over circuits using other methods of coupling? Are there any disadvantages to using a transformer for signal coupling between transistor stages? Explain in detail.</p>
<p>Transformers allow for impedance transformation between stages, as well as phase inversion (if desired). However, their parasitic (leakage) inductance and inter-winding capacitance may cause the amplifier to have strange frequency response characteristics.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: label the transformerâ€™s polarity using &quot;dot&quot; notation in order to achieve no inversion of signal from input to output (as shown).</p>
<p>Ask your students to explain what <em>impedance transformation</em> is and why it is important, especially in amplifier circuits. This will be a good review of both transformer theory and the maximum power transfer theorem.</p>
<p>Regarding phase inversion, a fun challenge here is to have students specify the &quot;dot convention&quot; necessary for this particular transformer to obtain the non-inverting characteristic of this two-stage amplifier circuit. In other words, have them draw dots near the transformer windings (with the proper relative relationship) to produce the phasing shown by the sine-wave symbols in the diagram.</p>
