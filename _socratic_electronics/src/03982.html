<p>The equivalence between NAND gates and Negative-OR gates is something easily verified by an examination of these two gates’ respective truth tables, and is often a starting-point for learning about DeMorgan’s Theorem:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03982x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>A lesser-known fact is how the equivalence between NAND and Negative-OR gates may be transformed to express an equivalence between two other types of gates, shown here:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03982x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Another example is shown here:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03982x03.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Explain how the first equivalence (between the NAND and the Negative-OR gate) was transformed into the latter two equivalences, both in terms of the gate symbols and their respective Boolean expressions. In other words, explain <em>how</em> we can derive the last two examples by manipulating the first example.</p>
<p>This is a lot like algebraically manipulating equations: doing the exact same thing to both sides of an equation to arrive at a new equation that is more useful to us. I’ll let you figure out the details of how this is done.</p>
<p>This question is a precursor to having students create combinational gate circuits using nothing but NAND or NOR gates.</p>
