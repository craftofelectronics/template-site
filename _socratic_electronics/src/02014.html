<p>What parameters determine the <em>frequency</em> of a power supplyâ€™s ripple voltage?</p>
<p>For linear power supplies (those designs having a transformer-rectifier-filter topology), the parameters determining ripple frequency are line frequency and rectification pulses.</p>
<p>Note that I did not simply say the ripple frequency is equal to line frequency for half-wave rectification and double the line frequency for full-wave. Such an answer is misleading, since it completely ignores polyphase AC rectification!</p>
