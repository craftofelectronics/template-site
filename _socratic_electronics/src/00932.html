<p>Calculate the output voltage of this op-amp circuit (using negative feedback):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00932x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Also, calculate the DC voltage gain of this circuit.</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>o</em><em>u</em><em>t</em></sub> = </span> -8.1 volts</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>A</em><sub><em>V</em></sub> = </span> 5.4</p>
<p>Follow-up question: the midpoint of the voltage divider (connecting to the inverting input of the op-amp) is often called a <em>virtual ground</em> in a circuit like this. Explain why.</p>
<p>It is important that students learn to analyze the op-amp circuit in terms of voltage drops and currents for each resistor, rather than just calculate the output using a gain formula. Detailed, Ohm’s Law analysis of op-amp circuits is essential for analyzing more complex circuitry.</p>
<p>The &quot;virtual ground&quot; question is an important one for the sake of rapid analysis. Once students understand how and why there is such a thing as a &quot;virtual ground&quot; in an op-amp circuit like this, their analysis of op-amp circuits will be much more efficient.</p>
