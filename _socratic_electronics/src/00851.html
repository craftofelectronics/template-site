<p>Capacitors and inductors are complementary components – both conceptually and mathematically, they seem to be almost exact opposites of each other. Calculate the total impedance of this series-connected inductor and capacitor network:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00851x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math">${\bf Z_{total}} =$</span> 13 <span class="math">Ω </span> <span class="math">∠</span> -90<span class="math">$^{o}$</span></p>
<p>Follow-up question: does this circuit &quot;appear&quot; to be inductive or capacitive from the source’s point of view?</p>
<p>Here, the complementary nature of inductive and capacitive reactances is plain to see: they subtract in series. Challenge your students by asking them what the total impedance of this circuit would be if the two reactances were equal.</p>
