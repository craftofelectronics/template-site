<p>Working on a job site with an experienced technician, you are tasked with trying to determine whether the line currents going to a three-phase electric motor are balanced. If everything is okay with the motor and the power circuitry, of course, the three line currents should be precisely equal to each other.</p>
<p>The problem is, neither of you brought a clamp-on ammeter for measuring the line currents. Your multimeters are much too small to measure the large currents in this circuit, and connecting an ammeter in series with such a large motor could be dangerous anyway. So, the experienced technician decides to try something different â€“ he uses his multimeter as an AC milli-voltmeter to measure the small voltage drop across each fuse, using the fuses as crude shunt resistors:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03624x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>He obtains the following measurements:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\vbox{\offinterlineskip

} }$</span><br /> Do these voltage drop measurements suggest imbalanced motor line currents? Why or why not?</p>
<p>The results are inconclusive, because resistance for the whole fuse and holder assembly is not a reliably stable quantity. Corrosion between one of the fuse ends and the fuse holder clip, for example, would increase resistance between the points where millivoltage is shown measured.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: just because the results of these millivoltage measurements are inconclusive in this scenario does not necessarily mean the principle of using fuses as current-indicating shunt resistors is useless. Describe one application where using a fuse as a current-indicating shunt would yield trustworthy information about the current.</p>
<p>Challenge question: determine where you could measure millivoltage, that might be more reliable in terms of quantitatively indicating line current.</p>
<p>While measuring millivoltage across a <em>fuse</em> may seem like a strange diagnostic technique, it is one I have gainfully applied for years. The &quot;catch&quot; is you have to know what it is good for and what it is not. It is <em>not</em> a precise, quantitative technique by any means!</p>
