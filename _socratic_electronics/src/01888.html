<p>All large electric power generating systems in the world today produce <em>three phase</em> power, rather than single phase power. Explain why this is so, in terms of advantages of distribution and use.</p>
<p>Generating and distributing AC power in three-phase form is more efficient than if it were done in single-phase form.</p>
<p>Please do not accept the given answer as a student response! This answer is very shallow, not communicating much meaning. Ask your students to explain <em>why</em> polyphase power systems enjoy greater efficiencies than monophase power systems. There is more than one correct answer to this question!</p>
