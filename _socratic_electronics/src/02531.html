<p>All other factors being equal, which amplifier requires less input signal <em>current</em> to drive, one built with a bipolar junction transistor (BJT) or one built with a JFET?</p>
<p>JFET amplifiers draw less input current, because their gate-channel PN junctions are reverse-biased and therefore exhibit very high impedance.</p>
