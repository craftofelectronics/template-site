<p>A student builds this transistor amplifier circuit on a solderless &quot;breadboard&quot;:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01180x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The purpose of the potentiometer is to provide an adjustable DC bias voltage for the transistor, so it may be operated in Class-A mode. After some adjustment of this potentiometer, the student is able to obtain good amplification from the transistor (signal generators and oscilloscopes have been omitted from the illustration for simplicity).</p>
<p>Later, the student accidently adjusts the power supply voltage to a level beyond the JFETâ€™s rating, destroying the transistor. Re-setting the power supply voltage back where the student began the experiment and replacing the transistor, the student discovers that the biasing potentiometer must be re-adjusted to achieve good Class-A operation.</p>
<p>Intrigued by this discovery, the student decides to replace this transistor with a third (of the same part number, of course), just to see if the biasing potentiometer needs to be adjusted again for good Class-A operation. It does.</p>
<p>Explain why this is so. Why must the gate biasing potentiometer be re-adjusted every time the transistor is replaced, even if the replacement transistor(s) are of the exact same type?</p>
<p>This amplifier circuit uses <em>gate bias</em>, which is a notoriously unstable method of biasing a JFET amplifier circuit.</p>
<p>Ask your students to explain exactly what it is that causes the Q point of this amplifier circuit to change with each new transistor. Is it something in the transistor itself, or in some other part of the circuit?</p>
<p>Given the instability of gate biasing, should this method be used in mass-produced amplifier circuits? Ask your students to elaborate on why or why not.</p>
