<p>The formula for calculating total resistance of three series-connected resistors is as follows:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math"><em>R</em> = <em>R</em><sub>1</sub> + <em>R</em><sub>2</sub> + <em>R</em><sub>3</sub></span><br /></p>
<p>Algebraically manipulate this equation to solve for one of the series resistances (<span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span>) in terms of the other two series resistances (<span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>3</sub></span>) and the total resistance (<span class="math"><em>R</em></span>). In other words, write a formula that solves for <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> in terms of all the other variables.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$R_1 = R - (R_2 + R_3) \hbox{\hskip 30pt or \hskip 30pt} R_1 = R - R_2 - R_3$</span><br /></p>
<p>This question is nothing more than practice algebraically manipulating equations. Ask your students to show you how they solved it, and how the two given answers are equivalent.</p>
