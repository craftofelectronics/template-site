<p>Alternating current produced by electromechanical generators (or <em>alternators</em> as they are sometimes designated) typically follows a sine-wave pattern over time. Plot a sine wave on the following graph, by tracing the height of a rotating vector inside the circle to the left of the graph:</p>

<p>To illustrate the principle here, I will show how the point is plotted for a rotation of 45<span class="math">$^{o}$</span>:</p>

<p>You may wish to use a <em>protractor</em> to precisely mark the angles along the rotation of the circle, in making your sine-wave plot.</p>

<p>For many students, this might be the first time they realize trigonometry functions have anything to do with electricity! That voltage and current in an AC circuit might alternate according to a mathematical function available in their calculators is something of a revelation. Be prepared to discuss <em>why</em> rotating electromagnetic machines naturally produce such waveforms. Also, encourage students to make the cognitive connection between the independent variable of a sine function (angle, expressed in units of degrees in this question) to actual shaft rotation in a real generator.</p>
