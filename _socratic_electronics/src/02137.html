<p>Explain what a <em>crowbar</em> circuit is, and how it employs an SCR to protect a circuit from excessive voltage.</p>
<p>A &quot;crowbar&quot; circuit uses an SCR to clamp the output voltage of a DC power supply in the event of accidental overvoltage, in the same manner that a (literal) metal crowbar thrown across the terminals of a power supply would forcibly clamp the output voltage.</p>
<p>Discuss with your students whether or not they think a crowbar circuit is the sort of mechanism that sees regular use, or whether it is seldom activated.</p>
