<p>In any electrically conductive substance, what are <em>charge carriers</em>? Identify the charge carriers in metallic substances, semiconducting substances, and conductive liquids.</p>
<p>&quot;Charge carriers&quot; are any particles possessing an electrical charge, whose coordinated motion through a substance constitutes an electric current. Different types of substances have different charge carriers:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Metals: &quot;free&quot; (conduction-band) electrons</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Semiconductors: electrons and holes</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Liquids: ions</p>
<p>Metals are by far the simplest materials to understand with reference to electrical conduction. Point out to your students that it is this simplicity that makes metallic conduction so easy to mathematically model (Ohm’s Law, <span class="math"><em>E</em> = <em>I</em><em>R</em></span>).</p>
