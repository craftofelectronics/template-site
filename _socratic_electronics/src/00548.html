<p>A <em>strain gauge</em> is a device used to measure the strain (compression or expansion) of a solid object by producing a resistance change proportional to the amount of strain:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00548x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The bridge circuit is supposed to respond to changes in specimen strain, but explain what will happen to the voltage measured across this bridge circuit (<span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>A</em><em>B</em></sub></span>) if the specimen’s temperature increases (with no stress applied), assuming that the bridge begins in a balanced condition with no strain on the gauge, at room temperature. Assume a positive <span class="math"><em>α</em></span> value for the strain gauge conductors.</p>
<p>What does this indicate about the effectiveness of this device as a strain-measuring instrument?</p>
<p>If the specimen heats up, a voltage will develop between points <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong>, with <strong>A</strong> being positive and <strong>B</strong> being negative.</p>
<p>Be sure to have your students explain how they arrived at their answers for polarity across the voltmeter terminals.</p>
<p>Ask your students whether or not the fact of the circuit’s sensitivity to temperature invalidates its use as a strain-measuring system. Is it impossible to obtain a reliable measurement of strain, if we know temperature also affects the circuit output voltage? How could we compensate for the effects of temperature on the system?</p>
