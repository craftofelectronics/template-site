<p>Does this switch (in the closed state) have a low resistance or a high resistance between its terminals?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00027x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>A closed switch is supposed to have <em>low</em> resistance between its terminals.</p>
<p>Ask the students what it would mean if a closed switch actually measured having high resistance between its terminals. Knowing what the measurements of any electrical component <em>ought to be</em> is a very important skill for troubleshooting.</p>
