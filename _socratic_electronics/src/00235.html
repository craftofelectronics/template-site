<p>How are connections made between the various wire ends of components inserted into <em>printed circuit boards</em> (&quot;PCBs&quot;)?</p>
<p>Component wire ends are typically soldered onto strips of copper metal (called &quot;traces&quot;) affixed on the surface of the printed circuit board material, which itself is electrically insulating.</p>
