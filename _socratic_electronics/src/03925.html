<p><em>Common-mode rejection ratio</em> is the ratio between a differential amplifier’s differential voltage gain and its common-mode voltage gain:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\hbox{CMRR} = {A_{V(diff)} \over A_{V(CM)}}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The greater this parameter’s value, the better the differential amplifier will perform as a truly <em>differential</em> amplifier. Combine the equations for differential voltage gain and for common-mode voltage gain for the following differential amplifier circuit, into a single equation for CMRR:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03925x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\hbox{CMRR} \approx {R_E \over r'_e}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Follow-up question: what component value(s) should be altered to maximize CMRR in a differential pair circuit, and why?</p>
<p>You might want to add that CMRR is usually expressed in decibels, calculated the same way you would calculate decibels for any other ratio of voltages.</p>
