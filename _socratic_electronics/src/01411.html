<p>Design a circuit to convert four-bit Gray code to four-bit binary. Hint: it uses Exclusive-OR gates.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01411x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Challenge question: this circuit is not as suited to high-speed conversion as a binary-to-Gray converter, even though it uses the same quantity and same type of logic gate. Explain why problems may arise if this circuit is forced to convert Gray code inputs that are changing rapidly (for instance, translating the output of a Gray-code rotary encoder into binary, when the mechanical encoder is rotating at a very high speed).</p>
<p>This circuit is very easy to design, if you remember the conversion process going from Gray to binary. There are many good references available for students to learn (or re-learn) this process from, so donâ€™t simply tell them how to do it! Let them research it on their own.</p>
