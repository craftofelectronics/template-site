<p>In order for students to answer this question, they must review the internal operation of an oscilloscope. This does not have to be rigorous â€“ a block-diagram understanding is good enough. The important thing is that they understand what the capacitor does for the oscilloscope input. Once this is understood, students will have a much better understanding of <em>why</em> and <em>where</em> the coupling control is used.</p>
