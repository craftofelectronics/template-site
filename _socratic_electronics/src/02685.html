<p>Suppose you owned a scientific calculator with two broken buttons: the multiply (<span class="math"> × </span>) and divide (<span class="math"> ÷ </span>). Demonstrate how you could solve this simple multiplication problem using only logarithms, addition, and antilogarithms (powers):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$7 \times 5 = \hbox{???}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The answer to this problem was easy enough for you to figure out without a calculator at all, so here are some more practice problems for you to try:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math">23 × 35</span> =</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math">781 × 92</span> =</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math">19. 4 × 60</span> =</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math">0. 019 × 2. 6</span> =</p>
<p>Here I will show you the steps to using logarithms to solve the first multiplication problem:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$7 \times 5 = \hbox{???}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">7 × 5 = 10<sup>log7 + log5</sup></span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">7 × 5 = 10<sup>0. 8451 + 0. 6990</sup></span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">7 × 5 = 10<sup>1. 5441</sup></span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">7 × 5 = 35</span><br /></p>
<p>Since the others are easy enough for you to check (with your non-broken calculator!), I’ll leave their solutions in your capable hands.</p>
<p>Incidentally, there is nothing special about the common logarithm to warrant its exclusive use in this problem. We could have just as easily applied the natural logarithm function with the same (final) result:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$7 \times 5 = \hbox{???}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">7 × 5 = <em>e</em><sup>ln7 + ln5</sup></span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">7 × 5 = <em>e</em><sup>1. 9459 + 1. 6094</sup></span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">7 × 5 = <em>e</em><sup>3. 5553</sup></span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">7 × 5 = 35</span><br /></p>
