<p>A student is trying to use the &quot;current divider formula&quot; to calculate current through the second light bulb in a three-lamp lighting circuit (typical for an American household):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01739x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The student uses Joule’s Law to calculate the resistance of each lamp (240 <span class="math">Ω </span>), and uses the parallel resistance formula to calculate the circuit’s total resistance (80 <span class="math">Ω </span>). With the latter figure, the student also calculates the circuit’s total (source) current: 1.5 A.</p>
<p>Plugging this into the current divider formula, the current through any one lamp turns out to be:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$I = I_{total} \left( {R_{total} \over R} \right) = 1.5 \hbox{ A} \left( {80 \&gt; \Omega \over 240 \&gt; \Omega} \right) = 0.5 \hbox{ A}$</span><br /></p>
<p>This value of 0.5 amps per light bulb correlates with the value obtained from Joule’s Law directly for each lamp: 0.5 amps from the given values of 120 volts and 60 watts.</p>
<p>The trouble is, something doesn’t add up when the student re-calculates for a scenario where one of the switches is open:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01739x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>With only two light bulbs in operation, the student knows the total resistance must be different than before: 120 <span class="math">Ω </span> instead of 80 <span class="math">Ω </span>. However, when the student plugs these figures into the current divider formula, the result seems to conflict with what Joule’s Law predicts for each lamp’s current draw:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$I = I_{total} \left( {R_{total} \over R} \right) = 1.5 \hbox{ A} \left( {120 \&gt; \Omega \over 240 \&gt; \Omega} \right) = 0.75 \hbox{ A}$</span><br /></p>
<p>At 0.75 amps per light bulb, the wattage is no longer 60 W. According to Joule’s Law, it will now be 90 watts (120 volts at 0.75 amps). What is wrong here? Where did the student make a mistake?</p>
<p>The student incorrectly assumed that total current in the circuit would remain unchanged after the switch opened. By the way, this is a <em>very</em> common conceptual misunderstanding among new students as they learn about parallel circuits!</p>
<p>I am surprised how often this principle is misunderstood by students as they first learn about parallel circuits. It seems natural for many of them to assume that total circuit current is a constant when the source is actually a constant-<em>voltage</em> source!</p>
