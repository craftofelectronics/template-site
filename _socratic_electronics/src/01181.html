<p>The simple JFET amplifier circuit shown here (built with surface-mount components) employs a biasing technique known as <em>self-biasing</em>:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01181x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Self-biasing provides much greater Q-point stability than gate-biasing. Draw a schematic diagram of this circuit, and then explain how self-biasing works.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01181x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Self-biasing uses the negative feedback created by a source resistor to establish a &quot;natural&quot; Q-point for the amplifier circuit, rather than having to supply an external voltage as is done with gate biasing.</p>
<p>The concept of negative feedback is extremely important in electronic circuits, but it is not easily grasped by all. Self-biasing of JFET transistors is a relatively easy-to-understand application of negative feedback, so be sure to take advantage of this opportunity to explore the concept with your students.</p>
<p>Ask your students to explain why Q-point stability is a desirable feature for mass-produced amplifier circuits, as well as circuits subject to component-level repair.</p>
