<p>Define the following terms: <em>energy</em>, <em>work</em>, and <em>power</em>.</p>
<p><em>Work</em> is the exertion of a force over a distance. <em>Energy</em> is the capacity to perform work. <em>Power</em> is the rate of work performed per unit time.</p>
<p>Students may find a basic physics text helpful in obtaining these definitions. &quot;Work&quot; is a difficult concept to precisely define, especially for students unfamiliar with basic physics. Technically, it is the vector dot-product of force and displacement, meaning that work equals force times distance <em>only</em> if the force and distance vectors are precisely parallel to each other. In other words, if I carry a 10 kg mass (lifting <em>up</em> against the tug of gravity) while walking parallel to the ground (not going up or down), the force and displacement vectors are perpendicular to each other, and the work I do in carrying the mass is <em>zero</em>. It is only if my force is directed precisely the same direction as my motion that all of my effort is translated into work.</p>
