<p>Explain what will happen to the unmagnetized rotor when 3-phase AC power is applied to the stationary electromagnet coils. Note that the rotor is actually a short-circuited electromagnet:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00739x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The rotor will rotate due to the action of Lenz’s Law.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: what would happen if the rotor’s coil were to become open-circuited?</p>
<p>Here, we see a practical 3-phase <em>induction</em> motor. Be sure to thoroughly discuss what is necessary to increase or decrease rotor speed, and compare this with what is necessary to increase or decrease speed in a DC motor.</p>
