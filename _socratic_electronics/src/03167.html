<p>A student builds this headphone audio source selector/amplifier circuit to be able to choose from one of four audio signal sources with the push of a single &quot;Select&quot; button. As the Select button is pushed, the two-bit binary counter (made from JK flip-flops) goes through its counting sequence, driving the decoder to select one of the four CMOS bilateral analog switches to pass audio signal on to the opamp volume control. LEDs indicate which input source is being selected at any given time:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03167x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The circuit works just fine for awhile, then suddenly all channels fall silent. Pushing the &quot;Select&quot; button, the LEDs still come on one at a time, but there is no sound at the headphone.</p>
<p>Using an oscilloscope, the student measures a normal audio signal at TP12 with respect to ground (TP2) as the CD player plays a disk. From this information, identify two possible causes that could account for the problem and all measured values in this circuit. Also, identify the next logical test point(s) from those shown on the schematic that you would check, and why you would check there. Note that there may be more than one correct answer to this part of the question!</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Possible causes of the problem</p>
<p>1.</p>
<p>2.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Next logical test point(s) to check, with reason why you would check there</p>
<p>Next point(s):</p>
<p>Reason:</p>
<p>Note: the following answers are not exhaustive. There may be more circuit elements possibly at fault than what is listed here!</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Possible causes of the problem</p>
<p>1. Headphone failed open or shorted</p>
<p>2. Break in wire(s) between TP14 and headphone</p>
<p>3. Opamp dead (power loss to opamp, output failed high or low, etc.)</p>
<p>4. Volume control potentiometer failed open at wiper</p>
<p>5. Break in wire between TP14 and potentiometer</p>
<p>6. Short circuit between TP14 and ground</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Next logical test point(s) to check, with reason why you would check there</p>
<p>1. TP17, to see if opamp is still outputting any signal</p>
<p>2. TP14, to see if opamp is receiving an input to amplify</p>
