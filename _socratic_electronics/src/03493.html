<p>Calculate the number of &quot;turns&quot; (wraps) a wire coil would need in order to produce an MMF (<span class="math">$\cal F$</span>) of 5.7 amp-turns with an electric current of 12 mA.</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>N</em></span> = 475 turns</p>
<p>Nothing special here, just a simple calculation. One of the points of this question is to have students research the formula for calculating <span class="math">$\cal F$</span>, as simple as it is.</p>
