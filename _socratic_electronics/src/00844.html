<p>What does it mean if an operational amplifier has the ability to &quot;swing its output rail to rail&quot;? Why is this an important feature to us?</p>
<p>Being able to &quot;swing&quot; the output voltage &quot;rail to rail&quot; means that the full range of an op-ampâ€™s output voltage extends to within millivolts of either power supply &quot;rail&quot; (+V and -V).</p>
<p>Challenge question: identify at least one op-amp model that has this ability, and at least one that does not. Bring the datasheets for these op-amp models with you for reference during discussion time.</p>
<p>Discuss what this feature means to us as circuit builders in a practical sense. Ask those students who tackled the challenge question to look up the output voltage ranges of their op-amp models. Exactly how close to +V and -V can the output voltage of an op-amp lacking &quot;rail-to-rail&quot; output capability &quot;swing&quot;?</p>
