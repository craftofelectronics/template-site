<p>Cranes used to move scrap iron and steel use electrically powered magnets to hold the metal pieces, rather than a scoop or some other mechanical grasping device:</p>

<p>In this illustration of a crane, superimpose a drawing showing the electromagnet, electrical power supply and wiring necessary for this to work. Also include a switch so the crane operator can turn the magnet on and off. Also, draw an electrical schematic diagram of the same circuit, showing all components in the craneâ€™s magnet circuit.</p>
<p>Here is my schematic diagram:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00171x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>I will leave it to you to draw the illustration of this circuit on the crane. Your answer should show a wire <em>coil</em> embedded in the electromagnet assembly, a switch symbol near the operator, a battery symbol for the power supply, and wires carrying current to and from the electromagnet coil.</p>
<p>The main purpose of this question is to have the students relate the principles of electric circuits and electromagnetism to a real-life application, and to show how the wire paths in the crane do not resemble the neat, clean layout of the schematic diagram.</p>
