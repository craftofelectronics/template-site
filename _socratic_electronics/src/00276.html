<p>What is meant by the <em>ampacity</em> rating of a wire? What criteria establish the ampacity rating of any given wire?</p>
<p>The &quot;ampacity&quot; of a wire is its maximum rated current. I won’t tell you what criteria establish the ampacity rating of a wire, but I will say that you will find the characteristics of the insulation coating a wire has as much to do with a wire’s ampacity as the physical characteristics of the metal itself!</p>
<p>Be sure to ask your students what resource(s) proved helpful in researching the answer to this question. Being essentially a safety issue, there are several industry publications on electrical safety regulations that may prove informative.</p>
<p>This question connects several important principles together: physical ratings of materials, power dissipation in metallic conductors, and electrical safety. Challenge your students to &quot;connect&quot; these principles on their own by probing their knowledge with follow-up questions.</p>
