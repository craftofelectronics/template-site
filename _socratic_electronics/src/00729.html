<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00729x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Range = 500 mA</p>
<p>Determining the ranges for this ammeter is simply an exercise in Ohm’s Law. It is very important that your students recognize the shunt resistor’s value as being in <em>milli</em>ohms and not <em>Mega</em>ohms! Yes, there is a difference between a lower-case letter &quot;m&quot; and a capital letter &quot;M&quot;!</p>
