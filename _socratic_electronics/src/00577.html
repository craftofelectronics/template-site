<p>We know that the formula relating instantaneous voltage and current in a capacitor is this:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$i = C{de \over dt}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Knowing this, determine at what points on this sine wave plot for capacitor voltage is the capacitor current equal to zero, and where the current is at its positive and negative peaks. Then, connect these points to draw the waveform for capacitor current:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00577x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>How much phase shift (in degrees) is there between the voltage and current waveforms? Which waveform is leading and which waveform is lagging?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00577x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>For a capacitor, voltage is lagging and current is leading, by a phase shift of 90<span class="math">$^{o}$</span>.</p>
<p>This question is an excellent application of the calculus concept of the <em>derivative</em>: relating one function (instantaneous current, <span class="math"><em>i</em></span>) with the instantaneous rate-of-change of another function (voltage, <span class="math">$de \over dt$</span>).</p>
