<p>Write a mathematical equation for this op-amp circuit, assuming all resistor values are equal:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01003x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>What is this circuit typically called?</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>c</em> =  − (<em>a</em> + <em>b</em>)</span></p>
<p>This type of circuit is typically called an <em>inverting summer</em>.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: explain why the addition of another resistor in this circuit is recommended for optimum accuracy, as shown in the following schematic.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01003x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Challenge question: write an equation describing the proper value of this extra resistor.</p>
<p>Ask your students about the proper resistor values for an inverting summer circuit. The choices of resistor values are definitely not the same for inverting summer and noninverting summer circuits alike! Discuss why the values are what they are in an inverting summer circuit (using Ohm’s Law to analyze the circuit’s function), emphasizing comprehension over rote memorization.</p>
