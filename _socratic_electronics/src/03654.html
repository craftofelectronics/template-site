<p>Calculate the output voltage of this passive differentiator circuit 150 microseconds after the rising edge of each &quot;clock&quot; pulse (where the square wave transitions from 0 volts to +5 volts):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03654x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>o</em><em>u</em><em>t</em></sub></span> = 1.172 volts @ 150 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>s after rising edge</p>
<p>This question is nothing more than an exercise in time-constant circuit calculations: determining how far the output voltage has decayed from its peak of 5 volts after 150 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>s. Ask your students to share their techniques for problem-solving with the whole class.</p>
