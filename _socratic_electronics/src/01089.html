<p>All thyristor devices exhibit the property of <em>hysteresis</em>. From an electrical perspective, what is &quot;hysteresis&quot;? How does this behavior differ from that of &quot;normal&quot; active semiconductor components such as bipolar or field-effect transistors?</p>
<p>Once turned on, a thyristor tends to remain in the &quot;on&quot; state, and visa-versa.</p>
<p>The hysteretic action of thyristors is often referred to as <em>latching</em>. Ask your students to relate this term to the action of a thyristor. Why is &quot;latching&quot; an appropriate term for this behavior? Can your students think of any applications for such a device?</p>
