<p>Solid-state switching circuits usually keep their constituent transistors in one of two modes: <em>cutoff</em> or <em>saturation</em>. Explain what each of these terms means.</p>
<p>&quot;Cutoff&quot; refers to that condition where a transistor is not conducting any collector current (it is fully off). &quot;Saturation&quot; means that condition where a transistor is conducting maximum collector current (fully on).</p>
<p>Follow-up question: is there such a thing as a state where a transistor operates somewhere between cutoff (fully off) and saturation (fully on)? Would this state be useful in a switching circuit?</p>
<p>In all fairness, not all transistor switching circuits operate between these two extreme states. Some types of switching circuits fall shy of true saturation in the &quot;on&quot; state, which allows transistors to switch back to the cutoff mode faster than if they had to switch back from a state of full saturation. ECL (Emitter-Coupled Logic) digital circuits are an example of non-saturating switch circuit technology.</p>
