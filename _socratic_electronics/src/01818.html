<p>Determine the RMS amplitude of this sinusoidal waveform, as displayed by an oscilloscope with a vertical sensitivity of 0.2 volts per division:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01818x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The RMS amplitude of this waveform is approximately 0.32 volts.</p>
<p>Students must properly interpret the oscilloscopeâ€™s display, then correctly convert to RMS units, in order to obtain the correct answer for this question.</p>
