<p><em>Voltage</em> is commonly defined as &quot;electrical pressure.&quot; The unit of the <em>volt</em>, however, may be defined in terms of more fundamental physical units. What are these units, and how do they relate to the unit of the volt?</p>
<p>1 volt is equal to 1 joule of energy imparted to 1 coulomb of charge (<span class="math">6. 25 × 10<sup>18</sup></span> electrons):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$V = {W \over Q}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Where,</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>V</em> = </span> Voltage (volts)</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>W</em> = </span> Work, or potential energy (joules)</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>Q</em> = </span> Charge (coulombs)</p>
<p>Note that I use the letter &quot;V&quot; to denote voltage rather than &quot;E&quot; as I usually do. This is because in general physics work, &quot;E&quot; usually stands for either &quot;Energy&quot; or &quot;Electric field&quot;. Some electronics reference books use the letter &quot;E&quot; for voltage, while others use the letter &quot;V&quot;, or even use the two letters interchangeably.</p>
