<p>If we energize an inductorâ€™s coil with an oscillating (AC) voltage, we will generate an oscillating magnetic flux in the inductor core:</p>

<p>If we wrap a second coil of wire around the same magnetic core as the first (inductor) coil, we set up a situation where mutual inductance exists: a change of current through one coil induces a voltage in the other, and visa-versa. This, obviously, will result in an AC voltage being induced in the second wire coil:</p>

<p>What name is given to such a device, with two coils of wire sharing a common magnetic flux? Also, plot both the magnetic flux waveform and the secondary (induced) voltage waveform on the same graph as the primary (applied) voltage waveform:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01876x03.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>This device is called a <em>transformer</em>.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01876x04.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Note: the relative amplitudes of <span class="math"><em>v</em><sub><em>p</em></sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>v</em><sub><em>s</em></sub></span> are arbitrary. I drew them at different amplitudes for the benefit of the reader: so the two waveforms would not perfectly overlap and become indistinguishable from one another.</p>
<p>Ask your students how the secondary coil would have to be made in order to truly generate a voltage greater than the applied (primary) coil voltage. How about generating a secondary voltage less than the primary?</p>
