<p>This inductive lamp-dimmer circuit used to work just fine but now it has a problem: the lamp refuses to energize, no matter what is done with the switch or the dimmer knob (on the variable inductor).</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03573x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Turning the switch &quot;on&quot; and moving the dimmer knob to the &quot;bright&quot; position, you test for AC voltage between terminals <strong>A</strong> and <strong>D</strong> with a voltmeter and get 115 volts AC. Based on this information, determine the following:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> components or wires in the circuit that you know cannot be failed either open or shorted.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> component or wire in the circuit you think could possibly be failed, and which test points you would measure between with your voltmeter to check it.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Power plug</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Wires from plug to terminals <strong>B</strong>, <strong>D</strong></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Fuse</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Wires between fuse and terminals <strong>A</strong>, <strong>B</strong></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Open switch (indicated by voltage between <strong>A</strong> and <strong>E</strong> or absence of voltage between <strong>E</strong> and <strong>D</strong>)</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Open lamp (indicated by voltage between <strong>J</strong> and <strong>L</strong>)</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Open inductor (indicated by voltage between <strong>E</strong> and <strong>G</strong>)</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Open (<em>name any wire or component from <strong>A</strong> to the lamp to <strong>D</strong></em>), indicated by voltage between nearest terminals</p>
