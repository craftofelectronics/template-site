<p>Suppose I wish to listen to the &quot;hum&quot; of ripple voltage from an AC-to-DC power supply using this detector. &quot;Ripple voltage,&quot; in case you don’t know, is a small AC voltage superimposed on a large DC voltage. If I simply connect my detector directly to the power supply’s terminals, I hear a LOUD &quot;click.&quot; If I turn the volume control down until the &quot;click&quot; is tolerable, the hum is too faint to hear. If I turn the volume control up far enough to hear the hum, then the &quot;click&quot; is far too loud for comfort.</p>
<p>How can I set up the detector so that it <em>only</em> detects the AC portion (the &quot;ripple&quot; voltage) of the power supply’s output, and not the DC portion?</p>
<p>This is actually quite simple to do, and it involves connecting a specific type of component in series with the detector’s test leads. I won’t directly tell you what this component is, but I’ll give you a hint: you will be doing that same thing that is done inside an oscilloscope when you set the &quot;coupling&quot; switch from the &quot;DC&quot; position to the &quot;AC&quot; position.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: modify the schematic diagram to include an AC/DC coupling switch, so the detector’s coupling may be switched from one mode to the other just like an oscilloscope.</p>
<p>It would be very helpful to have an AC-DC power supply with substantial ripple voltage available for students to do this exercise.</p>
