<p>This circuit has four &quot;test points&quot; labeled with the letters A, B, C, and D. Assuming the circuit is functioning (light bulb is energized), determine whether or not there will be substantial voltage between the following sets of points:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Between A and B: <em>voltage or no voltage</em>?</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Between B and C: <em>voltage or no voltage</em>?</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Between C and D: <em>voltage or no voltage</em>?</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Between D and A: <em>voltage or no voltage</em>?</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Between A and C: <em>voltage or no voltage</em>?</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Between D and B: <em>voltage or no voltage</em>?</p>
<p>Based on these voltage determinations, what general statement(s) can you make about the presence or absence of voltage in a functioning circuit?</p>
<p>Rather than tell you whether or not there will be voltage, I’ll let you build your own circuit and measure for yourself! I will, however, give you two &quot;rules&quot; that may be derived from these measurements:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Measuring between two terminals of a voltage source, or between two terminals of an energized load (a component having substantial resistance, with current going through it), there will be a voltage.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Measuring between two points that are <em>electrically common</em> to each other, there will be no voltage (or at least an insignificant amount of voltage).</p>
<p><em>Electrically common</em> points are defined as points within a circuit that are connected together by conductors of negligible resistance.</p>
<p>The concept of &quot;electrically common&quot; points is one that I have found very helpful in the analysis of circuits, because there are a some simple rules regarding voltage that relate to whether or not points in a circuit are &quot;common&quot; to each other.</p>
