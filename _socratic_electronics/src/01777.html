<p>Suppose you were designing a circuit that required two LEDs for &quot;power on&quot; indication. The power supply voltage is 15 volts, and each LED is rated at 1.6 volts and 20 mA. Calculate the dropping resistor sizes and power ratings:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01777x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>After doing this, a co-worker looks at your circuit and suggests a modification. Why not use a single dropping resistor for both LEDs, economizing the number of components necessary?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01777x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Re-calculate the dropping resistor ratings (resistance <em>and</em> power) for the new design.</p>
<p>With two resistors: <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub> = <em>R</em><sub>2</sub> = 670 Ω </span>, rated for at least 0.268 watts (1/2 watt would be a practical rating).</p>
<p>With one resistor: <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub> = 335 Ω </span>, rated for at least 0.536 watts (1 watt would be a practical rating).</p>
<p>Follow-up question: if there were no perfectly sized resistors sized to choose from (which there most likely will not be!), would it be safer to choose a higher-value resistor or a lower-value resistor for these applications? For example, if you needed 670 <span class="math">Ω </span> but the closest options on hand were 680 <span class="math">Ω </span> and 500 <span class="math">Ω </span>, which resistance value would you select? Explain your answer.</p>
<p>If students are not yet familiar with the &quot;+V&quot; symbol used to denote the positive power supply connection in this schematic, let them know that this is a very common practice in electronic notation, just as it is common to use the ground symbol as a power supply connection symbol.</p>
<p>The follow-up question is a very practical one, for it is seldom that you have the exact components on-hand to match the requirements of a circuit you are building. It is important to understand which way is safer to err (too large or too small) when doing &quot;as-built&quot; design work.</p>
