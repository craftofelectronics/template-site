<p>A student connects a model CA3130 operational amplifier as a voltage follower (or voltage buffer), which is the simplest type of negative feedback op-amp circuit possible:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00942x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>With the noninverting input connected to ground (the midpoint in the split +6/-6 volt power supply), the student expects to measure 0 volts DC at the output of the op-amp. This is what the DC voltmeter registers, but when set to AC, it registers substantial AC voltage!</p>
<p>Now this is strange. How can a simple voltage buffer output <em>alternating current</em> when its input is grounded and the power supply is pure DC? Perplexed, the student asks the instructor for help. &quot;Oh,&quot; the instructor says, &quot;you need a compensation capacitor between pins 1 and 8.&quot; What does the instructor mean by this cryptic suggestion?</p>
<p>Some op-amps are inherently unstable when operated in negative-feedback mode, and will oscillate on their own unless &quot;phase-compensated&quot; by an external capacitor.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: Are there any applications of an op-amp such as the CA3130 where a compensation capacitor is not needed, or worse yet would be an impediment to successful circuit operation? Hint: some models of op-amp (such as the model 741) have built-in compensation capacitors!</p>
<p>Your students should have researched datasheets for the CA3130 op-amp in search of an answer to this question. Ask them what they found! Which terminals on the CA3130 op-amp do you connect the capacitor between? What size of capacitor is appropriate for this purpose?</p>
<p>Given the fact that some op-amp models come equipped with their own built-in compensation capacitor, what does this tell us about the CA3130’s need for an external capacitor? Why didn’t the manufacturer simply integrate a compensation capacitor into the CA3130’s circuitry as they did with the 741? Or, to phrase the question more directly, ask your students to explain what <em>disadvantage</em> there is in connecting a compensation capacitor to an op-amp.</p>
