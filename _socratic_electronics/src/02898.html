<p>Some digital circuits are considered to have <em>active-low</em> inputs, while others have <em>active-high</em> inputs. Explain what each of these terms means, and how we might identify which type of input(s) a digital circuit has.</p>
<p>An &quot;active-low&quot; input is one where that particular gate function is activated or invoked on a <em>low</em> logic state. Active-low inputs are identified by inversion bubbles (or inversion wedges) drawn at the IC input terminals. For example, the Enable input (EN) for the following integrated circuit is active-low, meaning the chip is enabled when that input line is held at ground potential:</p>

<p>This S-R latch circuit has active-low preset (<span class="math">$\overline{\hbox{PRE}}$</span>) and clear (<span class="math">$\overline{\hbox{CLR}}$</span>) inputs, meaning the latch circuit will be preset and cleared when each of these inputs are grounded, respectively:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02898x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Active-high inputs, conversely, engage their respective functions when brought to power supply rail (<span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>D</em><em>D</em></sub></span> or <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>C</em><em>C</em></sub></span>) potential. As one might expect, an active-high input will <em>not</em> have an inversion bubble or wedge next to the input terminal.</p>
<p>Challenge question: to the surprise of many students, there are a great number of digital logic circuit types built with active-low inputs. Explain why. Hint: most of these circuit types and functions were pioneered with TTL logic rather than CMOS logic.</p>
<p>Active-low inputs tend to confuse many students, hence my unusually long and descriptive answer.</p>
