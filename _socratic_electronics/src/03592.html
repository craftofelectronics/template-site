<p>Calculating apparent power for a single-phase AC circuit is easy – simply multiply line voltage by line current (<span class="math"><em>S</em> = <em>V</em><em>I</em></span>):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03592x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>How do we calculate apparent power in a balanced three-phase circuit, given the same figures?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03592x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math">$S = \sqrt{3}(VI)$</span></p>
<p>Follow-up question: suppose the three-phase system were a Delta configuration instead of a Wye configuration. Does this influence the apparent power calculation? Why or why not?</p>
<p>The formula for calculating power in a balanced three-phase system may be found in any textbook. Let your students do the necessary research!</p>
