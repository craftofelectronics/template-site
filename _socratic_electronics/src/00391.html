<p>Plot the power dissipation of the load resistance, for several values between 1 k<span class="math">Ω </span> and 20 k<span class="math">Ω </span>:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00391x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>At what load resistance value is the load’s power dissipation maximized?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00391x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>What practical application can you think of for this principle of power maximization? In what applications might we be interested in delivering the maximum amount of power possible to a load?</p>
