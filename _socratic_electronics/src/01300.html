<p>What is the <em>complement</em> of a Boolean number? How do we represent the complement of a Boolean variable, and what logic circuit function performs the complementation function?</p>
<p>A Boolean &quot;complement&quot; is the <em>opposite</em> value of a given number. This is represented either by overbars or prime marks next to the variable (i.e. the complement of <span class="math"><em>A</em></span> may be written as either <span class="math">$\overline{A}$</span> or <span class="math"><em>A</em>สน</span>):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01300x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Students need to be able to readily associate fundamental Boolean operations with logic circuits. If they can see the relationship between the &quot;strange&quot; rules of Boolean arithmetic and something they are already familiar with (i.e. truth tables), the association is made much easier.</p>
