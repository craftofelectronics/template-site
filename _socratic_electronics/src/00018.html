<p>Most electrical wire is covered in a rubber or plastic coating called <em>insulation</em>. What is the purpose of having this &quot;insulation&quot; covering the metal wire?</p>
<p>The purpose of <em>insulation</em> covering the metal part of an electrical wire is to prevent accidental contact with other conductors of electricity, which might result in an unintentional electric current through those other conductors.</p>
<p>Not only is this question practical from the standpoint of understanding circuit function, but also from the perspective of electrical safety. Why is it important for wires to be insulated? Are overhead power lines insulated like the wires used in classroom projects? Why or why not? How were electrical wires insulated before the advent of modern plastics technology?</p>
