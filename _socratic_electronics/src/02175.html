<p>If the power waveform is plotted for an AC circuit with a 90 degree phase shift between voltage and current, it will look something like this:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02175x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>What is the significance of the power value oscillating equally between positive (above the zero line) and negative (below the zero line)? How does this differ from a scenario where there is zero phase shift between voltage and current?</p>
<p>A symmetrically oscillating power waveform represents energy going back and forth between source and load, never actually dissipating.</p>
<p>Discuss with your students the energy-storing and energy-releasing ability of capacitors and inductors, and how they differ from resistors. This is key to understanding the zero net power dissipation of reactive components in AC circuits.</p>
