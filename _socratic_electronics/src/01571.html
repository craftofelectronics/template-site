<p>A music recording studio is equipped with three microphones, each of which connect to the &quot;mixer&quot; panel by means of shielded cables:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01571x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The purpose of the mixer is to function as a multi-channel audio signal amplifier, to control the volume of each sound channel so that a good &quot;mix&quot; is obtained for recording. The studio engineer will use the individual controls on the mixer to &quot;blend&quot; the inputs for the best recording tone and quality.</p>
<p>This system has a problem, though. Microphone #2 seems to be &quot;dead,&quot; meaning that channel #2 on the mixer does not register any signal when the singer sings into that microphone. All the other channels are working just fine, though.</p>
<p>Being the studio technician, you job is to troubleshoot this problem in the shortest time possible. Unfortunately, in your rush to get to the job site you forgot to bring your test equipment. That isnâ€™t a problem, however, because you know how to troubleshoot systems by swapping interchangeable components.</p>
<p>I will present four different &quot;swap&quot; scenarios to you, with two different outcomes for each. Your task is to declare what is known about the location of the fault based on these scenarios and outcomes.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01571x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01571x03.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01571x04.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01571x05.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Scenario #1, outcome #1: problem is <em>not</em> in the microphone.</p>
<p>Scenario #2, outcome #2: microphone #2 is faulty.</p>
<p>Scenario #2, outcome #1: problem is <em>not</em> in the microphone.</p>
<p>Scenario #2, outcome #2: microphone #2 is faulty.</p>
<p>Scenario #3, outcome #1: mixer input #2 is faulty.</p>
<p>Scenario #3, outcome #2: the problem is <em>not</em> in the mixer.</p>
<p>Scenario #4, outcome #1: the problem is <em>not</em> in the cable.</p>
<p>Scenario #4, outcome #2: cable #2 is faulty.</p>
<p>Your more adept students will immediately recognize that scenarios 1 and 2 are really quite the same. The logical thinking behind this troubleshooting strategy may confound some of your students, so be prepared to spend adequate time covering and re-covering (if necessary) this question. By the way, this type of question is excellent for a written test!</p>
