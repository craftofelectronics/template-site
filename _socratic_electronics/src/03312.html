<p>Just as addition is the inverse operation of subtraction, and multiplication is the inverse operation of division, a calculus concept known as <em>integration</em> is the inverse function of differentiation. Symbolically, integration is represented by a long &quot;S&quot;-shaped symbol called the integrand:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\hbox{If \hskip 10pt} x = {dy \over dt} \hbox{\hskip 10pt (} x \hbox{ is the derivative of }y\hbox{ with respect to }t\hbox{)}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\hbox{Then \hskip 10pt} y = \int x \&gt; dt \hbox{\hskip 10pt (} y \hbox{ is the integral of }x\hbox{ with respect to }t\hbox{)}$</span><br /></p>
<p>To be truthful, there is a bit more to this reciprocal relationship than what is shown above<sup><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>It is perfectly accurate to say that differentiation undoes integration, so that <span class="math">${d \over dt} \int x \&gt; dt = x$</span>, but to say that integration undoes differentiation is not entirely true because indefinite integration always leaves a constant <span class="math"><em>C</em></span> that may very well be non-zero, so that <span class="math">$\int {dx \over dt} \&gt; dt = x + C$</span> rather than simply being <span class="math"><em>x</em></span>., but the basic idea you need to grasp is that integration &quot;un-does&quot; differentiation, and visa-versa. Derivatives are a bit easier for most people to understand, so these are generally presented before integrals in calculus courses. One common application of derivatives is in the relationship between position, velocity, and acceleration of a moving object. Velocity is nothing more than rate-of-change of position over time, and acceleration is nothing more than rate-of-change of velocity over time:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$v = {dx \over dt} \hbox{\hskip 20pt Velocity (}v \hbox{) is the time-derivative of position (}x \hbox{)}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$a = {dv \over dt} \hbox{\hskip 20pt Acceleration (}a \hbox{) is the time-derivative of velocity (}v \hbox{)}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Illustrating this in such a way that shows differentiation as a process:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03312x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Given that you know integration is the inverse-function of differentiation, show how position, velocity, and acceleration are related by integration. Show this both in symbolic (proper mathematical) form as well as in an illustration similar to that shown above.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$x = \int v \&gt; dt \hbox{\hskip 20pt Position (}x \hbox{) is the time-integral of velocity (}v \hbox{)}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$v = \int a \&gt; dt \hbox{\hskip 20pt Velocity (}v \hbox{) is the time-integral of acceleration (}a \hbox{)}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03312x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Challenge question: explain why the following equations are more accurate than those shown in the answer.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$x = \int v \&gt; dt + x_0 \hbox{\hskip 20pt Position (}x \hbox{) is the time-integral of velocity (}v \hbox{)}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$v = \int a \&gt; dt + v_0 \hbox{\hskip 20pt Velocity (}v \hbox{) is the time-integral of acceleration (}a \hbox{)}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Where,</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>x</em><sub>0</sub></span> is the initial position (at time = 0)</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>v</em><sub>0</sub></span> is the initial velocity (at time = 0)</p>
<p>The purpose of this question is to introduce the integral as an inverse-operation to the derivative. Introducing the integral in this manner (rather than in its historical origin as an accumulation of parts) builds on what students already know about derivatives, and prepares them to see integrator circuits as counterparts to differentiator circuits rather than as unrelated entities.</p>
