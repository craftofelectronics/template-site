<p>Be sure to note <em>everything</em> accomplished for each day, so your instructor has a complete record of your progress.</p>
<p>The purpose of this report form is to familiarize students with the concept of time management as it relates to project completion. Too many students have a tendency to do little or nothing until just before their project is due. By assigning a grade value for progress made each day, you help them learn time management skills and also help them complete their projects sooner (and better!).</p>
