<p>Some inexpensive household lamps use a diode to achieve two-position light control (dim and bright):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00782x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Explain how this circuit is able to make the light bulb glow brighter and dimmer.</p>
<p>With the switch in the &quot;dim&quot; position, the light bulb only receives power for one-half of the AC cycle.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: does it matter which way the diode is oriented in the circuit? If we reversed its connections, would the light bulb behave any differently?</p>
<p>Although this circuit is not very complex, it reveals an application of diode rectification often overlooked: power control for non-polarized loads. Ask your students how the energy efficiency of a circuit like this compares to a rheostat (resistive) light dimming circuit.</p>
