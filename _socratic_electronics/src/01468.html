<p>An important function in computer circuitry is <em>serial-to-parallel data conversion</em>, where a stream of serial data is &quot;read&quot; one bit at a time, then all bits output at once in parallel form. A shift register circuit is ideal for this application. Shown here is an eight-bit shift register circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01468x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Draw any necessary wires and labels showing where serial data would enter the circuit, and where parallel data would exit.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01468x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Follow-up question: if we were to actually use this circuit for serial-to-parallel data conversion, we would have to be careful how fast we clocked the shift register. Explain why.</p>
<p>The subject of serial-to-parallel data conversion is much deeper than what is suggested by this disarmingly simple circuit. Talk with your students about the need for clock synchronization (even in &quot;asynchronous&quot; serial data transmission).</p>
