<p>Resistors are sometimes represented in electrical and electronic schematic diagrams by a symbol other than this:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00060x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Draw this other symbol next to the one shown above.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00060x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>It might be a good idea to occasionally draw schematic diagrams for your students using the &quot;other&quot; resistor symbol, just so they are not taken by surprise when they see this symbol in real schematics. Just be sure to remain consistent in your symbolism within each diagram: never mix the two different symbols within the same schematic!</p>
