<p>The characteristically colored glow from a gas-discharge electric light is the result of energy emitted by electrons in the gas atoms as they fall from high-level &quot;excited&quot; states back to their natural (&quot;ground&quot;) states. As a general rule of electron behavior, they must absorb energy from an external source to leap into a higher level, and they release that energy upon returning to their original level.</p>
<p>Given the existence of this phenomenon, what do you suspect might be occurring inside a PN junction as it conducts an electric current?</p>
<p>PN junctions emit energy of a characteristic wavelength when conducting current. For some types of PN junctions, the wavelengths are within the visible range of light.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: what practical application can you think of for this phenomenon?</p>
<p>The practical application of this phenomenon should be obvious, and it is very commonplace in modern electronic equipment. Discuss with your students the energy-efficiency of this light emission as compared to an incandescent lamp.</p>
