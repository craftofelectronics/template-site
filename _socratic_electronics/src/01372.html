<p>If the clock frequency driving this flip-flop is 240 Hz, what is the frequency of the flip-flop’s output signals (either <span class="math"><em>Q</em></span> or <span class="math">$\overline{Q}$</span>)?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01372x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math"><em>f</em><sub><em>o</em><em>u</em><em>t</em></sub></span> = 120 Hz</p>
<p>Follow-up question: how could you use another flip-flop to obtain a square-wave signal of 60 Hz from this circuit?</p>
<p>Ask your students to think of some practical applications for this type of circuit. For those who are musically inclined, ask them what the <em>musical</em> relationship is between notes whose frequencies are an exact 2:1 ratio (hint: it’s the same interval as <em>eight</em> white keys on a piano keyboard). How could a circuit such as this possibly be used in a musical synthesizer?</p>
