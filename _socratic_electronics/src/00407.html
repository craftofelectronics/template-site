<p>The majority of the &quot;humming&quot; sound emitted by an unloaded transformer is due to an effect known as <em>magnetostriction</em>. What is this effect, exactly?</p>
<p>&quot;Magnetostriction&quot; is the physical strain (contraction or expansion) of a material when subjected to a magnetic field.</p>
<p>Ask your students if they discovered whether magnetostrictive materials normally contract or expand with the application of a magnetic field. The answer to this question is quite surprising!</p>
