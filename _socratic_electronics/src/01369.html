<p>Suppose a student wants to build a sound-controlled lamp control circuit, whereby a single clap or other loud burst of noise turns the lamp on, and another single clap turns it off. The sound-detection and lamp-drive circuitry is shown here:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01369x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Add a J-K flip-flop to this schematic diagram to implement the toggling function.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01369x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Some students may ask whether there is any significance to using the <span class="math">$\overline{Q}$</span> output rather than the <span class="math"><em>Q</em></span>. Discuss this with your students: whether they think it will make any difference, or if it was just an arbitrary choice made by the circuitâ€™s designer. Then, ask them how they would go about <em>proving</em> their judgment.</p>
<p>There are plenty of &quot;what if&quot; failure scenarios you could ask your students about here, challenging them to analyze this circuit with a troubleshooting perspective. If time permits, have some fun with this.</p>
