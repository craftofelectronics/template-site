<p>Use circuit simulation software to verify your predicted and measured parameter values.</p>
<p>Use a variable-voltage, regulated power supply to supply any amount of DC voltage below 30 volts. If using this question as a lab exercise rather than an assessment, I recommend specifying a voltage that is standard for batteries, so students donâ€™t necessarily have to have an adjustable power supply available to do this lab.</p>
<p>In this exercise, the student must both quantitatively and qualitatively analyze the circuit, because the ideal resistor value probably does not exist. As the instructor, it is you task to choose voltage and current specifications that preclude exact solutions with common resistor values.</p>
