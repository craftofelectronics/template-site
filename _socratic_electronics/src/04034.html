<p>Provide a definition for <em>phasor</em>, as the term applies to electrical calculations.</p>
<p>A &quot;phasor&quot; is a complex-number representation of an electrical quantity, such as voltage, current, or impedance.</p>
<p>The ingredient of <em>complex</em> must be present in any definition of a phasor. A phasor, while it may be classified as a type of <em>vector</em> (possessing both magnitude and direction), is not the same as the vectors commonly used in other areas of physics (e.g. force vectors, electric/magnetic field vectors, etc.).</p>
