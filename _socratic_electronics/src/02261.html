<p>Identify some ways in which harmonics may be mitigated in AC power systems, since they tend to cause trouble for a variety of electrical components.</p>
<p>Filter circuits may be employed to block harmonic frequencies from reaching certain sensitive components.</p>
<p>The answer given here is correct, but vague. I did not specify the type of filter or exactly how it might be connected to a load. These are questions to ask your students during discussion.</p>
