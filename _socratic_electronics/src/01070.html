<p>Draw the proper wire connections necessary for &quot;enhancing&quot; this MOSFET with the solar cell’s voltage, so that the battery energizes the relay whenever there is sufficient light exposure on the solar cell:</p>

<p>Challenge question: connect a commutating (&quot;free-wheeling&quot;) diode into the circuit shown, so that inductive &quot;kickback&quot; from the relay de-energizing does not harm the MOSFET.</p>
<p>Students should note that the circuit shown is not the only possible way a MOSFET could be used to turn a relay on. Often, the substrate (SS) and source (S) terminals of the MOSFET are made common with each other, so that the controlling and controlled circuits share a common point (usually the system &quot;ground&quot; point).</p>
<p>Ask your students what would happen if the battery’s polarity were reversed.</p>
