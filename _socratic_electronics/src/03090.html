<p>Substitution is a technique whereby we let a variable represent (stand in the place of) another variable or an expression made of other variables. One application where we might use substitution is when we must manipulate an algebraic expression containing multiple instances of the same sub-expression. For example, suppose we needed to manipulate this equation to solve for <span class="math"><em>c</em></span>:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$1 = {{a + b(d^2 - f^2) + c} \over {d^2 - f^2}}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The sub-expression <span class="math"><em>d</em><sup>2</sup> − <em>f</em><sup>2</sup></span> appears twice in this equation. Wouldn’t it be nice if we had something simpler to put in its place during the time we were busy manipulating the equation, if for no other reason than to have less variables to write on our paper while showing all the steps to our work? Well, we can do this!</p>
<p>Substitute the variable <span class="math"><em>x</em></span> for the sub-expression <span class="math"><em>d</em><sup>2</sup> − <em>f</em><sup>2</sup></span>, and then solve for <span class="math"><em>c</em></span>. When you are done manipulating the equation, back-substitute <span class="math"><em>d</em><sup>2</sup> − <em>f</em><sup>2</sup></span> in place of <span class="math"><em>x</em></span>.</p>
<p>Original equation:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$1 = {{a + b(d^2 - f^2) + c} \over {d^2 - f^2}}$</span><br /></p>
<p>After substituting <span class="math"><em>x</em></span>:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$1 = {{a + bx + c} \over x}$</span><br /></p>
<p>After manipulating the equation to solve for <span class="math"><em>c</em></span>:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math"><em>c</em> = <em>x</em>(1 − <em>b</em>) − <em>a</em></span><br /></p>
<p>Back-substituting the original sub-expression in place of <span class="math"><em>x</em></span>:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math"><em>c</em> = (<em>d</em><sup>2</sup> − <em>f</em><sup>2</sup>)(1 − <em>b</em>) − <em>a</em></span><br /></p>
<p>Here I show an application of substitution that is useful only because the human brain has an easier time dealing with a single symbol than with a collection of different symbols. More powerful uses of algebraic substitution exist, of course, but this is a start for students who are new to the concept.</p>
