<p>Suppose we have an alternator with two sets of windings, <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong>:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01886x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Each pair of windings in each set is series-connected, so they act as just two separate windings:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01886x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>If one end of each winding pair were connected together at a common ground point, and each winding pair output 70 volts RMS, how much voltage would be measured between the open winding pair ends?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01886x03.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>99 volts</p>
<p>Hint: if you don’t understand how this voltage value was calculated, plot the voltage output of the two windings as if they were shown on an oscilloscope. The <em>phase relationship</em> between the two voltages is key to the solution.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: draw a phasor diagram showing how the difference in potential (voltage) between the wire ends is equal to 99 volts, when each winding coil’s voltage is 70 volts.</p>
<p>This question is a good exercise of students’ knowledge of phase shift, in a very practical context.</p>
