<p>Where are the power supply pins most commonly located for integrated circuits in the standard &quot;DIP&quot; form? Some manufacturers of high-speed digital ICs are now relocating power supply pins to the middle of the package, like this:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01425x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Explain the rationale for this non-traditional pin assignment.</p>
<p>Power supply pins on DIP chips are usually located in the upper left and lower-right corners (pins 14 and 7 on a 14-pin DIP, pins 16 and 8 on a 16-pin DIP), <em>but this is not always the case!</em>.</p>
<p>Centered power supply pins on modern high-speed DIPs exhibit less parasitic inductance than corner-located pins.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: what is the best way to determine pin assignments on any given integrated circuit?</p>
<p>Let your students know that even some of the older integrated circuits had &quot;weird&quot; power supply pin locations, so they cannot assume corner-pins for every older DIP they see! An example of this is the 2102L static RAM, or the 4049 CMOS hex inverting buffer.</p>
<p>Even stranger is DIP chips with <em>multiple</em> +V and GND pins. Good examples of this include the 74AC11004 and the 74AUC16373.</p>
