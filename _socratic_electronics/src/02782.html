<p>Convert the following logic gate circuit into a Boolean expression, writing Boolean sub-expressions next to each gate output in the diagram:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02782x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02782x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The process of converting gate circuits into Boolean expressions is really quite simple, if you proceed gate by gate. Have your students share whatever methods or &quot;tricks&quot; they use to write the expressions with the rest of the class.</p>
