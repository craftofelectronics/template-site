<p>Re-write this mathematical expression so that the exponent term (<span class="math"> − <em>x</em></span>) is no longer negative:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math"><em>e</em><sup> − <em>x</em></sup></span><br /></p>
<p>Also, describe the calculator keystroke sequence you would have to go through to evaluate this expression given any particular value for <span class="math"><em>x</em></span>.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$e^{-x} = {1 \over {e^x}}$</span><br /></p>
<p>I am usually not a fan of discussing calculator keystroke sequences to college-level students, but I have resorted to this at the college where I teach because so many of my students have no idea of how to evaluate exponential expressions! Of course, the actual keystrokes one must push to evaluate this expression depend on the brand of calculator used.</p>
