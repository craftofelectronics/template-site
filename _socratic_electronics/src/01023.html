<p>Design an op-amp circuit that <em>divides</em> one quantity (<span class="math"><em>x</em></span>) by another quantity (<span class="math"><em>y</em></span>) using logarithms. To give you a start on this circuit, Iâ€™ll provide the initial logarithmic op-amp modules in this diagram:</p>
<p>Note: it will be helpful for your analysis to write the mathematical expression at each op-amp output in your circuit, so you may readily see how the overall math function is constructed from individual steps.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01023x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The circuit shown in the answer is a very common logarithmic construction: a <em>log-ratio</em> circuit, useful for many operations other than simple division. This question challenges students to put together the logarithm, antilogarithm, and differential op-amp circuits in a way that achieves the final design goal. Perhaps the most challenging aspect of this problem is managing the sign reversals.</p>
