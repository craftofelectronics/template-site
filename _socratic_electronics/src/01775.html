<p>What will happen to each resistor’s voltage and current in this circuit if resistor R1 fails open? Provide individual answers for each resistor, please.</p>

<p>If resistor R1 fails open . . .</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>R</em>1</sub></span> will increase to full supply voltage, <span class="math"><em>I</em><sub><em>R</em>1</sub></span> will decrease to zero</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>R</em>2</sub></span> will decrease to zero, <span class="math"><em>I</em><sub><em>R</em>2</sub></span> will decrease to zero</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>R</em>3</sub></span> will decrease to zero, <span class="math"><em>I</em><sub><em>R</em>3</sub></span> will decrease to zero</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>R</em>4</sub></span> will decrease to zero, <span class="math"><em>I</em><sub><em>R</em>4</sub></span> will decrease to zero</p>
<p>Follow-up question: note the order in which I list the qualitative effects of R2’s shorted failure. Reading from the top of the list to the bottom reveals the sequence of my reasoning. Explain why I would come to the conclusions I did, in the order I did.</p>
<p>I have found in teaching that many students loathe qualitative analysis, because they cannot let their calculators do the thinking for them. However, being able to judge whether a circuit parameter will increase, decrease, or remain the same after a component fault is an <em>essential</em> skill for proficient troubleshooting.</p>
