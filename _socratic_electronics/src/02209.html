<p>Explain how the construction of an <em>isolation</em> transformer differs from that of a <em>step-up</em> or <em>step-down</em> transformer.</p>
<p>Step-down transformers have fewer secondary turns than primary turns, while step-up transformers have more secondary turns than primary turns. Isolation transformers have equal turns in both windings.</p>
<p>Ask your students to explain the relationship between primary and secondary turns, and how this affects the voltage transformation ratio, based on mutual inductance.</p>
