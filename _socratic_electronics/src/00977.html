<p>In a properly biased Class B amplifier circuit, how much voltage should be between the points <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong>?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00977x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>0 volts, at all moments in time!</p>
<p>Follow-up questions: explain how this fact may be useful in troubleshooting push-pull amplifier circuits, and also explain how this fact proves the amplifier has a voltage gain of unity (1).</p>
<p>Challenge your students to apply Kirchhoffâ€™s Voltage Law to the &quot;loops&quot; around these two points, as such:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00977x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Knowing that the voltage between points <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong> is zero, ask your students what the voltage drops <em>must</em> be across the biasing resistors. This question foreshadows the concept of a &quot;virtual ground&quot; in operational amplifier circuits. It is the idea that two or more points in a circuit may be held at the same potential without actually being connected together. In other words, the points are <em>virtually common</em> rather than being <em>actually common</em> with one another.</p>
