<p>Explain what <em>leakage inductance</em> is, in a system of two or more mutually coupled inductors (such as a <em>transformer</em>). In a transformer, is leakage inductance a good thing or a bad thing?</p>
<p>&quot;Leakage inductance&quot; is inductance that is <em>not</em> mutual between coupled inductors. It is caused by magnetic flux produced by one coil that does not &quot;link&quot; with turns of the other coil(s).</p>
<p>In power distribution transformers, leakage inductance is undesirable. However, there are some applications where leakage inductance is a desirable attribute. Step-up transformers used to power gas-discharge lights, for example, are purposely built to have significant amounts of leakage inductance.</p>
<p>After discussing the nature of leakage inductance (what causes it, and how it manifests itself in a transformer circuit), ask your students to explain why we do not want to have leakage inductance in a power distribution transformer, and why we do want to have it in a gas-discharge lighting transformer.</p>
