<p>When a resistor conducts electric current, its temperature increases. Explain how this phenomenon is significant to the application of resistors in electric circuits. In other words, why would we care about a resistorâ€™s temperature increasing?</p>
<p>Also, what does this indicate about the technical ratings of resistors? Aside from having a specific resistance rating (i.e. a certain number of <em>ohms</em>), what other rating is important for proper selection of resistors in electric circuits?</p>
<p>The heating effect of electricity through a resistance is significant because that resistance may be damaged by excessive temperature. To avoid damage, resistors must be selected to be able to withstand a certain amount of heating.</p>
<p>Students need to understand that resistance alone does not fully dictate the selection of a resistor for electrical service. Failure to heed the dissipation ratings of a resistor can result in catastrophic failure!</p>
<p>A good follow-up question to this is to ask what the <em>unit of measurement</em> is for this kind of thermal rating.</p>
