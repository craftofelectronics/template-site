<p>The fact that switched capacitor networks can behave equivalently to resistors is exploited in a variety of integrated circuits. At first, this may seem strange, as switched capacitor networks generally require at least two switching transistors and a two-phase, non-overlapping clock (in addition to the capacitor itself) in order to function, which seems like a lot of peripheral circuitry compared to a single resistor. What possible advantage is there to using switched capacitor networks in integrated circuits instead of resistors? Support your answer with research, if possible.</p>
<p>Switched capacitor networks are not just resistor equivalents, they are <em>variable</em> resistor equivalents. Also, these networks actually tend to be smaller than integrated circuit resistors, and are less prone to drift.</p>
<p>There are other advantages to switched capacitor networks, but these are just some of the basic reasons behind their prevalence in modern integrated circuits.</p>
<p>Ask your students to explain why switched capacitor networks are less prone to drift than resistors constructed on a semiconductor substrate. Just focus on one source of drift, such as temperature, to simplify the topic. What effect does temperature have on a semiconducting resistor, and why? What effect does temperature have on a capacitor built of semiconductor layers separated by an insulating layer, and why? With discrete components, are capacitors more stable over time than resistors? Why or why not?</p>
