<p>With the headphones connected to the input of your audio detector circuit, what is the <em>lowest</em> current level of signal you can hear, as measured with a sensitive milliammeter connected in series between your detector and a signal source?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01494x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Compare this against the lowest amount of audible signal current for the headphones directly. Which component of the detector circuit is responsible for this increased sensitivity?</p>
<p>The transformer. But, can you explain <em>why?</em></p>
<p>This is a very practical way for students to experience the significance of impedance matching using transformers.</p>
