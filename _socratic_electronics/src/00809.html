<p>If the ends of a wire loop are attached to two half-circular metal strips, arranged so that the two strips almost form a complete circle, and those strips are contacted by two &quot;brushes&quot; which connect to opposite poles of a battery, what polarity of voltage will be measured as the loop is rotated counter-clockwise?</p>

<p>Follow-up question: does the polarity measured at the two carbon brushes ever reverse? Or, to phrase the question another way, if a resistor were connected between the two brush contacts, would it &quot;see&quot; direct current (DC) or alternating current (AC)? Explain your answer.</p>
<p>Ask your students what the two half-circle metal strips are called, in electric motor/generator terminology.</p>
