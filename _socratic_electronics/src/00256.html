<p>The relationship between magnetic flux and induced voltage in a wire coil is expressed in this equation, known as <em>Faraday’s Law</em>:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$e = N {d \phi \over dt}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Where,</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>e</em> = </span> Instantaneous induced voltage, in volts</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>N</em> = </span> Number of turns in wire coil</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>ϕ</em> = </span> Instantaneous magnetic flux, in webers</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>t</em> = </span> Time, in seconds</p>
<p>Explain what the mathematical expression <span class="math">${d \phi \over dt}$</span> means, in light of what you know about electromagnetic induction. Hint: the <span class="math">$d \over d$</span> notation is borrowed from calculus, and it is called the <em>derivative</em>.</p>
<p>Also, explain why lower-case letters are used (<span class="math"><em>e</em></span> instead of <span class="math"><em>E</em></span>, <span class="math"><em>ϕ</em></span> instead of <span class="math">Φ </span>) in this equation.</p>
<p>The mathematical expression <span class="math">${d \phi \over dt}$</span> means &quot;rate of change of magnetic flux over time.&quot; In this particular example, the unit would be &quot;webers per second.&quot;</p>
<p>The use of lower-case letters for variables indicates <em>instantaneous</em> values: that is, quantities expressed in terms of instantaneous moments of time.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: manipulate this equation to solve for each variable (<span class="math">${d \phi \over dt} = \cdots$</span> ; <span class="math"><em>N</em> = ⋯</span>).</p>
<p>For students who have never studied calculus, this is an excellent opportunity to introduce the concept of the derivative, having already established the principle of induced voltage being related to how <em>quickly</em> magnetic flux changes over time. In general physics studies, the quantities of position, velocity, and acceleration are similarly used to introduce the concept of the time-derivative, and later, the time-integral. In electricity, though, we have our own unique applications!</p>
