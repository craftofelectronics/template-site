<p>A common analogy used to describe the different types of power in AC circuits is a mug of beer that also contains foam:</p>

<p>Explain this analogy, relating the quantities of beer and foam to the different types of power in an AC circuit, and also why this analogy is often employed to describe the &quot;desirability&quot; of each power type in a circuit.</p>
<p>The beer itself is &quot;true&quot; power (<span class="math"><em>P</em></span>, measured in Watts). Good beer, good. Ideally, we’d like to have a full mug of beer (true power). Unfortunately, we also have foam in the mug, representing &quot;reactive&quot; power (<span class="math"><em>Q</em></span>, measured in Volt-Amps-Reactive), which does nothing but occupy space in the mug. Bad foam, bad. Together, their combined volume constitutes the &quot;apparent&quot; power in the system (<span class="math"><em>S</em></span>, measured in Volt-Amps).</p>
<p>Follow-up question: can you think of any potential safety hazards that low power factor may present in a high-power circuit? We’re talking AC power circuits here, not beer!</p>
<p>Ask your students to apply this analogy to the following AC circuits: how much beer versus foam exists in each one?</p>
