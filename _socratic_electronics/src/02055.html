<p>Field-effect transistors (FETs) exhibit depletion regions between the oppositely-doped gate and channel sections, just as diodes have depletion regions between the P and N semiconductor halves. In this illustration, the depletion region appears as a dark, shaded area:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02055x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Re-draw the depletion regions for the following scenarios, where an external voltage (<span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>G</em><em>S</em></sub></span>) is applied between the gate and channel:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02055x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02055x04.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Note how the different depletion region sizes affect the conductivity of the transistorâ€™s channel.</p>

<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02055x05.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Follow-up question: why do you suppose this type of transistor is called a <em>field-effect</em> transistor? What &quot;field&quot; is being referred to in the operation of this device?</p>
<p>The effect that this external gate voltage has on the effective width of the channel should be obvious, leading students to understand how a JFET allows one signal to exert control over another (the basic principle of <em>any</em> transistor, field-effect or bipolar).</p>
