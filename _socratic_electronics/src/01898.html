<p>When you look at the schematic diagram for a passive integrator circuit, it ought to remind you of another type of circuit youâ€™ve seen before: a <em>passive filter</em> circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01898x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>What specific type of passive filter does a passive integrator circuit resemble? Is the resemblance the same for LR integrators as well, or just RC integrators? What does this resemblance tell you about the frequency response of a passive integrator circuit?</p>
<p>The answer to this question is so easy for you to research, it would be an insult to print it here!</p>
<p>This question is fairly easy, and provides a logical step to prepare students for frequency-domain analysis of passive integrator circuits.</p>
