<p>Explain why Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) is sometimes referred to as the &quot;8421&quot; code. Why is this code used at all?</p>
<p>BCD uses groups of four binary bits to represent each digit of a decimal number. The LSD place weights are 8-4-2-1, while the next significant digitâ€™s place weightings are 80-40-20-10, and so on.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: the four bits used for each BCD character could be called half of a byte (8 bits). There is a special word for a four-bit grouping. What is that word?</p>
<p>Discuss with your students the purpose of using BCD to represent decimal quantities. While not an efficient usage of bits, BCD certainly is convenient for representing decimal figures with discrete (0 or 1) logic states.</p>
