<p>Electrical engineers usually express the frequency of an AC circuit in terms of <em>angular velocity</em>, measured in units of <em>radians per second</em> rather than cycles per second (Hertz, or Hz).</p>
<p>First, explain what a <em>radian</em> is. Next, write an equation relating frequency (<span class="math"><em>f</em></span>) in Hertz to angular velocity (<span class="math"><em>ω</em></span>) in radians per second. Hint: the relationship between the two is perhaps most easily understood in terms of a two-pole AC generator, or alternator, where each revolution of the rotor generates one full cycle of AC.</p>
<p>A <em>radian</em> is that angle describing a sector of a circle, whose arc length is equal to the radius of the circle:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{04060x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Next, the equivalence between angular velocity (<span class="math"><em>ω</em></span>) and frequency (<span class="math"><em>f</em></span>):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math"><em>ω</em> = 2<em>π</em><em>f</em></span><br /></p>
<p>Personally, I find the rotating alternator model the best way to comprehend the relationship between angular velocity and frequency. If each turn of the rotor is one cycle (<span class="math">2<em>π</em></span> radians), and frequency is cycles per second, then one revolution per second will be 1 Hertz, which will be <span class="math">2<em>π</em></span> radians per second.</p>
