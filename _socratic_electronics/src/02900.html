<p>Use circuit simulation software to verify your predicted and actual truth tables.</p>
<p>In this activity, students are asked to figure out how to wire the inputs of the J-K flip-flop circuit, and also how to demonstrate the three modes (Set, Reset, and Toggle). Students will have to properly set up their square-wave signal generators to create a workable clock pulse. This not only means a clock pulse at the correct voltage levels, but also one that is slow enough to allow them to clearly see the toggling of the flip-flop.</p>
<p>A great thing to do here is have students use a logic probe to sense the clock pulse and compare that frequency with the blinking of the <span class="math"><em>Q</em></span> and <span class="math">$\overline{Q}$</span> LEDs.</p>
