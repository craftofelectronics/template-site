<p>What effect does temperature have on the electrical conductivity of a semiconducting material? How does this compare with the effect of temperature on the electrical conductivity of a typical metal?</p>
<p>Semiconducting materials have negative temperature coefficient of resistance (<span class="math"><em>α</em></span>) values, meaning that their resistance decreases with increasing temperature.</p>
<p>The answer to this question is a short review on temperature coefficients of resistance (<span class="math"><em>α</em></span>), for those students who may not recall the subject from their DC circuit studies. As always, though, the most important point of this question is <em>why</em> conductivity increases for semiconductors. Ask your students to relate their answer to the concept of <em>charge carriers</em> in semiconducting substances.</p>
<p>An interesting bit of trivia you could mention to your students is that glass – normally an excellent insulator of electricity – may be made electrically conductive by heating. Glass must be heated until it is red-hot before it becomes really conductive, so it is not an easy phenomenon to demonstrate. I found this gem of an experiment in an old book: , first edition (fourth impression), copyright 1938, by Richard Manliffe Sutton, Ph.D.</p>
