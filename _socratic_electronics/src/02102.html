<p>Write the standard form of the Pythagorean Theorem, and give an example of its use.</p>
<p>I’ll let you research this one on your own!</p>
<p>Follow-up question: identify an application in AC circuit analysis where the Pythagorean Theorem would be useful for calculating a circuit quantity such as voltage or current.</p>
<p>The Pythagorean Theorem is easy enough for students to find on their own that you should not need to show them. A memorable illustration of this theorem are the side lengths of a so-called <em>3-4-5</em> triangle. Don’t be surprised if this is the example many students choose to give.</p>
