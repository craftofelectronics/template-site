<p>Explain why transformers are used extensively in long-distance power distribution systems. What advantage do they lend to a power system?</p>
<p>Transformers are used to step voltage up for efficient transportation over long distances, and used to step the high voltage down again for point-of-use circuits.</p>
<p>Ask your students to explain the answer in detail, rather than just repeating what the given answer states. Why is high-voltage power distribution more efficient than low-voltage distribution? Why would high voltage have to be stepped down for point-of-use applications?</p>
