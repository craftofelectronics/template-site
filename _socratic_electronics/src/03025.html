<p>Calculate the voltage across the capacitor at time = 250 ms, assuming its initial voltage (at time = 0) was 0 volts. Also, calculate the time required for the capacitor to charge from 0 volts to 30 volts:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03025x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>C</em></sub></span> at 250 ms =</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>t</em></span> to reach 30 volts =</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>C</em></sub></span> at 250 ms = 20.63 volts</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>t</em></span> to reach 30 volts = 430.66 ms</p>
