<p>Use circuit simulation software to verify your predicted and measured parameter values.</p>
<p>The purpose of this exercise is for students to use simultaneous equations to arrive at values for fixed resistors <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span> that will limit output voltage adjustment to the limits specified.</p>
<p>An extension of this exercise is to incorporate troubleshooting questions. Whether using this exercise as a performance assessment or simply as a concept-building lab, you might want to follow up your studentsâ€™ results by asking them to predict the consequences of certain circuit faults.</p>
