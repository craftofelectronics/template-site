<p>Describe the difference between an <em>intrinsic</em> and an <em>extrinsic</em> semiconducting substance.</p>
<p>An &quot;intrinsic&quot; semiconducting material is absolutely pure. An &quot;extrinsic&quot; semiconducting material has dopant(s) added for enhanced conductivity.</p>
<p>Just a simple definition here, nothing more. This is easily referenced in any introductory textbook.</p>
