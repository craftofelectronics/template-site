<p>Determine both the waveshape and amplitude of the AC signal measured by the oscilloscope at the output of this circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01108x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The diodes are model 1N4001, each. The resistorâ€™s color code is Brown, Black, Orange, Silver.</p>
<p>The output will be a square wave with a peak-to-peak voltage of approximately 1.4 volts.</p>
<p>Ask your students why the waveform will be <em>square</em> rather than <em>sinusoidal</em>. Is it a perfect square-wave? Why or why not?</p>
