<p>Fundamentally, an <em>amplifier</em> is a device that takes in a low-power signal and outputs a magnified (power-boosted) facsimile of the input signal. Explain how it is possible for such a device to exist. Doesnâ€™t the Law of Energy Conservation (&quot;Energy can neither be created nor destroyed&quot;) preclude the existence of a power-boosting device?</p>
<p>No physical laws are violated with an amplifier, because the added power comes from an external source: a power supply.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: is a step-up transformer an amplifier? Why or why not?</p>
<p>The amplifiers your students will be studying are electronic devices, but other types of amplifiers exist. Discuss with them some examples of common, non-electronic amplifiers.</p>
