<p>Determine the <span class="math"><em>Q</em></span> and <span class="math">$\overline{Q}$</span> output states of this D-type gated latch, given the following input conditions:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01364x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Now, suppose we add a propagation-delay-based one-shot circuit to the Enable line of this D-type gated latch. Re-analyze the output of the circuit, given the same input conditions:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01364x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Comment on the differences between these two circuitsâ€™ responses, especially with reference to the enabling input signal (B).</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01364x03.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01364x04.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Follow-up question: one of these circuits is referred to as <em>edge-triggered</em>. Which one is it?</p>
<p>Challenge question: in reality, the output waveforms for both these scenarios will be shifted slightly due to propagation delays within the constituent gates. Re-draw the true outputs, accounting for these delays.</p>
<p>Discuss with your students the concept of edge-triggering, and how it is implemented in (one of) the circuits in this question. Ask them to describe any tips they may have discovered for analyzing pulse waveforms. Specifically, are there any particular times where we need to pay close attention to the D input signal to determine what the outputs do, and any times where we can ignore the D input status?</p>
<p>The challenge question regarding propagation delays is meant to remind students that the perfectly synchronized timing diagrams seen in textbooks are not exactly what happens in real life. Ask your students to elaborate on what real-life conditions would make such propagation delays relevant. Are there applications of digital circuits where we can all but ignore such delays?</p>
