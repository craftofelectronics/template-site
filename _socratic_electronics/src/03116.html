<p>Calculate all currents in this DC circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03116x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Hint: it may help you to set up the necessary equation by labeling the current through the lower resistor as <span class="math"><em>I</em></span> and the current through the upper resistor as <span class="math"><em>I</em></span> + 0.005.</p>
<p>Upper resistor current = 8.5 mA; lower resistor current = 3.5 mA</p>
<p>This is an interesting circuit to mathematically analyze. While not requiring simultaneous equations, or even a network theorem such as Superposition or Thévenin’s, it is nevertheless a good exercise in applying the basic laws of circuit analysis (Ohm’s, Kirchhoff’s) and algebra.</p>
