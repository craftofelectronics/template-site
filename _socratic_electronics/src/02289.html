<p>Complete the table of voltages for this opamp &quot;voltage follower&quot; circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02289x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>

<p>Follow-up question: the output voltage values given in this table are ideal. A real opamp would probably not be able to achieve even what is shown here, due to idiosyncrasies of these amplifier circuits. Explain what would probably be different in a <em>real</em> opamp circuit from what is shown here.</p>
<p>A common mistake I see students new to opamps make is assuming that the output voltage will magically attain whatever value the gain equation predicts, with no regard for power supply rail voltage limits.</p>
<p>Another good follow-up question to ask your students is this: &quot;How much voltage is there between the two input terminals in each of the situations described in the table?&quot; They will find that the &quot;golden rule&quot; of closed-loop opamp circuits can be violated!</p>
<p>If students have difficulty answering the follow-up question, drop these two hints: (1) <em>Rail-to-rail output swing</em> and (2) <em>Latch-up</em>.</p>
