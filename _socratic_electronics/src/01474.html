<p>A binary number is parallel-loaded into a shift register. The shift register is then commanded to &quot;shift right&quot; for one clock pulse. How does the value of the shifted binary number compare to the number originally loaded in, assuming that the MSB is on the very left flip-flop of the shift register?</p>
<p>The new binary number value will be one-half (or approximately one-half) the value that it was before.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: how could we use the shift register to <em>double</em> the value of a binary number?</p>
<p>Challenge question: when we divide a binary number in two by shifting its bit positions, the resulting answer may or may not be exactly one-half the original value. Explain why this is so. Also, analyze what happens when when we <em>multiply</em> a binary number by two through a process of bit-shifting. Is the resulting answer exactly twice the original value, or may it also be <em>approximate</em> as it sometimes is with division? Explain why or why not.</p>
<p>This is a really neat trick for dividing or multiplying binary numbers by powers of two. It is often used in machine-language microprocessor programming, due to its simplicity of execution.</p>
