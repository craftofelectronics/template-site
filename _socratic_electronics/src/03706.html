<p>Predict how all component voltages and currents in this circuit will be affected as a result of the following faults. Consider each fault independently (i.e. one at a time, no multiple faults):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03706x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Diode <span class="math"><em>D</em><sub>1</sub></span> fails open:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Generator winding <strong>C</strong> fails open:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Center connection joining generator windings fails open:</p>
<p>For each of these conditions, explain <em>why</em> the resulting effects will occur.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Diode <span class="math"><em>D</em><sub>1</sub></span> fails open: <em>Load receives 2-pulse rectification instead of 3-pulse, increased voltage across <span class="math"><em>D</em><sub>1</sub></span>.</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Generator winding <strong>C</strong> fails open: <em>Load receives 2-pulse rectification instead of 3-pulse, no current through <span class="math"><em>D</em><sub>3</sub></span>.</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Center connection joining generator windings fails open: <em>No voltage across any diode or across load, no current through any diode or through load.</em></p>
<p>The purpose of this question is to approach the domain of circuit troubleshooting from a perspective of knowing what the fault is, rather than only knowing what the symptoms are. Although this is not necessarily a realistic perspective, it helps students build the foundational knowledge necessary to diagnose a faulted circuit from empirical data. Questions such as this should be followed (eventually) by other questions asking students to identify likely faults based on measurements.</p>
