<p>What does the <em>amp-hour</em> capacity of a chemical battery represent? What does it mean if a battery is rated at, say, 150 amp-hours?</p>
<p>The amp-hour rating of a battery is an approximate indication of itâ€™s useful lifespan per charge.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: why not just rate batteries in terms of hours, instead of amp-hours? Since time is the value we are most likely interested in, why bother to refer to current (amps) at all?</p>
<p>Although the basic concept of an amp-hour battery rating is simple, it is important to realize that real battery discharge characteristics are very nonlinear, and therefore the simple &quot;amps times hours&quot; approach may yield grossly inaccurate predictions regarding battery life.</p>
