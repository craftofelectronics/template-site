<p>A picture is worth a thousand words, they say. For me, this illustration is the one that finally made transistors make sense to me. By forward-biasing the emitter-base junction, minority carriers are injected into the base (holes in the &quot;N&quot; type material, in the case of a PNP transistor), which then rise easily into the collector region. This energy diagram is invaluable for explaining why collector current can flow even when the base-collector junction is reverse biased.</p>
<p>When looking at energy diagrams, it is helpful to think of natural hole motion as air bubbles in a liquid, trying to rise as high as possible within their designated band.</p>
