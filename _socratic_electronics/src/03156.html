<p>Suppose we wished to use the first seven bits of each port (pins 0 through 6) on a microcontroller to drive two 7-segment, common-cathode displays, rather than use BCD-to-7-segment decoder ICs:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03156x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Write the necessary hexadecimal values to be output at ports A and B to generate the display &quot;28&quot; at the two 7-segment display units.</p>
<p>Port A = 7F<span class="math">$_{16}$</span> Port B = 5B<span class="math">$_{16}$</span></p>
<p>Note that the following answers are also valid:</p>
<p>Port A = FF<span class="math">$_{16}$</span> Port B = DB<span class="math">$_{16}$</span></p>
