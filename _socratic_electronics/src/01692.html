<p>Use circuit simulation software to verify your predicted and measured parameter values, using an AC current source as the motor, and a multi-conductor transmission line as the cable. Note: this may be quite complicated to set up in simulation!</p>
<p>The longer the cable, the better the coupling between the motor conductors and the other conductors. I have found that this exercise is practical with just a few feet of four-wire telephone cable.</p>
<p>It is very important to use a battery for this exercise, and not an AC-DC power supply. The filter capacitors in an AC-DC power supply naturally decouple the motorâ€™s noise voltage, making it difficult to measure any at all!</p>
<p>Noise voltage should be measured with an oscilloscope set to AC input coupling, and recorded as peak-to-peak volts.</p>
