<p>Write an approximate equation describing the <em>differential</em> voltage gain for a differential pair circuit such as this, in terms of the component values:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03923x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$A_{V(diff)} = {R_C \over 2r'_e}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Follow-up question: what component value(s) should be altered to maximize differential voltage gain in a differential pair circuit, and why?</p>
<p>The purpose of this question is to have students apply the Superposition theorem to combine two voltage gain equations into a single <em>differential</em> voltage gain equation.</p>
