<p>Define the following DC motor terms:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Field</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Armature</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Commutator</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Brush</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Field: <em>the portion of the motor creating the stationary magnetic field</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Armature: <em>the rotating portion of the motor</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Commutator: <em>copper strips where the armature coil leads terminate, usually located at one end of the shaft</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Brush: <em>a stationary carbon block designed to electrically contact the moving commutator bars</em></p>
<p>Students may find pictures of DC electric motors in their search for these terms’ definitions. Have them show these pictures to the class if possible. Also, a disassembled electric motor is a great &quot;prop&quot; for discussion on electric motor nomenclature.</p>
