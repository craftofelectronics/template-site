<p>When measuring the resistance of a JFET from source to drain, the ohmmeter reading may be seen to change simply by touching the gate terminal with your finger:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02062x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Such a degree of sensitivity is unheard of in bipolar junction transistors. Explain why the JFET is so sensitive, and comment on what advantages and disadvantages this gives the JFET as an electronic device.</p>
<p>The gate-channel PN junction of a JFET normally operates in reverse-bias mode, whereas bipolar transistors require a forward current for emitter-collector conduction.</p>
<p>The stated answer is purposefully vague, to force students to think and to express the answer in their own words.</p>
<p>It is quite easy to demonstrate this sensitivity in the classroom with nothing more than an ohmmeter and a JFET, and so I encourage you to set this up as a demonstration for your students.</p>
