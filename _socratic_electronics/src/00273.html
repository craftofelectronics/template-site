<p>Generally speaking, is an ammeter supposed to be connected in <em>series</em> or in <em>parallel</em> with the component it’s measuring current through?</p>
<p>Series.</p>
<p>If your students don’t already know, this question is an excellent opportunity for them to learn about what a &quot;series&quot; circuit is and how it differs from a &quot;parallel&quot; circuit. Ask your students <em>why</em> &quot;series&quot; is the correct answer. What is it about a series connection that makes it the best type of connection to use an ammeter in? What would happen if we connected an ammeter in <em>parallel</em> with a circuit component?</p>
