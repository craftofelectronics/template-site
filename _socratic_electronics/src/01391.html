<p>Shown here are two frequency response plots (known as <em>Bode plots</em>) for a pair of series resonant circuits. Each circuit has the same inductance and capacitance values, but different resistance values. The &quot;output&quot; is voltage measured across the resistor of each circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01391x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Which one of these plots represents the response of the circuit with the greatest <span class="math"><em>Q</em></span>, or <em>quality factor</em>?</p>
<p>The steeper plot corresponds to the circuit with the greatest <span class="math"><em>Q</em></span>.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: assuming both the inductance and the capacitance values are the same in these two resonant circuits, explain which circuit has the greatest resistance (<span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> or <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span>).</p>
<p>Challenge question: what does the word &quot;normalized&quot; mean with respect to the vertical axis scale of the Bode plot?</p>
<p>When your students study resonant filter circuits, they will better understand the importance of <span class="math"><em>Q</em></span>. For now, though, it is enough that they comprehend the basic notion of how <span class="math"><em>Q</em></span> impacts the voltage dropped by any one component in a series resonant circuit across a range of frequencies.</p>
