<p>Given two lengths of metal wire, which one will have the least electrical resistance: one that is short, or one that is long? Assume all other factors are equal (same metal type, same wire diameter, etc.).</p>
<p>The short wire will have less electrical resistance than the long wire.</p>
<p>Many analogies exist to express this concept: water through a pipe, compressed air through a hose, etc. Which pipe or hose is less restrictive: the short one or the long one?</p>
