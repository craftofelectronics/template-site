<p>FM tends to be a far more noise-resistant means of signal modulation than AM. For instance, the &quot;crackling&quot; form of radio interference caused by natural lightning or the &quot;buzzing&quot; noise produced by high-voltage power lines are both easy to hear on an AM radio, but absent on an FM radio. Explain why.</p>
<p>Radio interference manifests itself as additional peaks on the &quot;envelope&quot; of a modulated carrier wave. AM reception is based on the extraction of that envelope from the modulated carrier, and so AM receivers will &quot;pick up&quot; unwanted noise. FM reception is based on the extraction of information from changes in <em>frequency</em>, which is largely unaffected by noise.</p>
<p>Ask students to explain this principle in their own words, and not just repeat the given answer.</p>
