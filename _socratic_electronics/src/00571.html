<p>When using a padlock to secure a disconnect device in the &quot;open&quot; (off) state, who should be able to open that lock? In other words, how many other people should share a key to the lock you use to secure a breaker or switch in the safe position, if you are the one working on the system?</p>
<p>You and you alone should be able to open that lock. It needs to be a <em>personal</em> lock, not a lock whose key is shared by other people.</p>
<p>Discuss with your students why a personal lock is preferred over a &quot;group&quot; lock for locking out circuit disconnect devices.</p>
