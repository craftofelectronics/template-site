<p>Write a mathematical expression in the form of <span class="math"><em>y</em> = …<em>x</em></span> describing the function of this circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01006x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math"><em>y</em> = 3<em>x</em> + <em>b</em></span></p>
<p>In this circuit, we combine two different op-amp functions into one system, embodying a linear equation. Discuss with your students what circuit alterations would be required to change the coefficients of this equation.</p>
<p>If it helps some of your students understand the overall function of this circuit better, you might want to ask other students to outline which groups of components in this circuit perform which portion of the equation (while the circuit schematic is displayed on the whiteboard for all to see).</p>
