<p>When applying Ohm’s Law (<span class="math"><em>E</em> = <em>I</em><em>R</em></span> ; <span class="math">$I = {E \over R}$</span> ; <span class="math">$R = {E \over I}$</span>) to circuits containing multiple resistances, students often mix contexts of voltage, current, and resistance. Whenever you use any equation describing a physical phenomenon, be sure that each variable of that equation relates to the proper real-life value in the problem you’re working on solving. For example, when calculating the current through resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span>, you must be sure that the values for voltage and resistance are appropriate for that resistor and not some other resistor in the circuit. If you are calculating <span class="math"><em>I</em><sub><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></sub></span> using the Ohm’s Law equation <span class="math">$I = {E \over R}$</span>, then you must use the value of <em>that resistor’s</em> voltage (<span class="math"><em>E</em><sub><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></sub></span>) and <em>that resistor’s</em> resistance (<span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span>), not some other voltage and/or resistance value(s). Some students have an unfortunate tendency to overlook context when seeking values to substitute in place of variables in Ohm’s Law problems, and this leads to incorrect results.</p>
<p>A common electrical adage is that “Electricity always follows the path of least resistance.” This is only partly true. Given two or more paths of differing resistance, more current will flow through the path of least resistance, but this does not mean there will be zero current through the other path(s)! The saying should probably be revised to state that “Electricity <em>proportionately</em> favors the path of least resistance.” Be careful not to blindly follow some truism about electricity, but always think quantitatively about voltage and current values if possible! Perform some Ohm’s Law calculations on parallel circuit branches to convince yourself of how current &quot;favors&quot; lesser resistances, or measure currents in your own safe, low-voltage circuits to see firsthand how it works.</p>
<p>Series resistances are easy to conceptually manage: it just makes sense that multiple resistors connected end-to-end will result in a total resistance equal to the sum of the individual resistances. However, parallel resistances are not as intuitive. That some total quantity (total resistance) actually <em>decreases</em> as individual quantities accumulate (resistors connected in parallel) may seem impossible, usually because the word &quot;total&quot; is generally associated with addition.</p>
