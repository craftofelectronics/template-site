<p>Build a simple electric circuit using a battery as the electrical energy <em>source</em>, and a small light bulb as the electrical <em>load</em> (I suggest using a 6-volt &quot;lantern&quot; battery and a miniature incandescent light bulb rated for either 6 or 12 volts). Use &quot;jumper&quot; wires with metal clips at the ends to join these two electrical devices together:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01697x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>After connecting the components together properly so the light bulb lights up, answer the following questions:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> What conditions must be met for the light bulb to light up?</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> What happens if the circuit is &quot;broken&quot;?</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Does it matter where the circuit is &quot;broken&quot;?</p>
<p>Then, add a third jumper wire to the circuit so you have a ready &quot;break&quot; to experiment with:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01697x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Try bridging this &quot;break&quot; with various materials, and note whether or not the light bulb lights up:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Paper</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Steel paper clip</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Gold ring</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Rubber eraser</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Pencil lead (graphite)</p>
<p>Also, try touching the jumper wire ends together along their plastic exteriors, rather than at the metal &quot;clip&quot; ends. Does the light bulb light up when you do this?</p>
<p>Explain what this experiment demonstrates about the electrical <em>conductivity</em> of the various substances listed as well as the plastic coating of the jumper wires. Also explain why electrical wires are provided with that plastic coating, instead of being bare metal. Finally, explain what this experiment has taught you about electric circuits in general.</p>
<p>Let the electrons show you the answers to these questions!</p>
<p>I find that 6-volt &quot;lantern&quot; batteries work well for an experiment such as this, along with either 6 or 12 volt miniature light bulbs. Sometimes the over-rated light bulbs (12 volt rated lamp powered by a 6 volt battery) work better for showing students the glowing filament. The filament of an incandescent light bulb at full brightness is difficult to distinguish.</p>
<p>Please avoid using LED’s or any polarity-sensitive devices until your students are ready to explore polarity!</p>
