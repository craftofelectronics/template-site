<p>Suppose you need to store a text message in digital memory, consisting of 7500 ASCII characters. What is the most logical memory organization (addresses <span class="math"> × </span> data lines) to do this? How many address bits would be needed to store these 7500 characters?</p>
<p>Ideal memory organization: 8k <span class="math"> × </span> 8, thirteen address bits required.</p>
<p>Be sure to ask your students <em>how</em> they calculated 13 bits for the address. Of course, there is the trial-and-error method of trying different powers of two, but there is a much more elegant solution involving logarithms to find the requisite number of bits.</p>
