<p>The circuit shown here is commonly referred to as a <em>current divider</em>. Calculate the voltage dropped across each resistor, the current drawn by each resistor, and the total amount of electrical resistance &quot;seen&quot; by the 9-volt battery:</p>

<p>Can you think of any practical applications for a circuit such as this?</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Current through the 2 k<span class="math">Ω </span> resistor = 4.5 mA</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Current through the 3 k<span class="math">Ω </span> resistor = 3 mA</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Current through the 5 k<span class="math">Ω </span> resistor = 1.8 mA</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Voltage across each resistor = 9 volts</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>t</em><em>o</em><em>t</em><em>a</em><em>l</em></sub></span> = 967.74 <span class="math">Ω </span></p>
<p>How much current is drawn from the battery in this circuit? How does this figure relate to the individual resistor currents, and to the total resistance value?</p>
<p>Some students may find the diagram hard to follow, and so they will find the task of analysis helped by drawing an equivalent schematic diagram for this circuit, with all terminal points labeled. I recommend you not suggest this solution immediately, but rather challenge your students to think of problem-solving techniques on their own. Surely, someone in the class will have thought of doing this, and the impact of such a suggestion coming from a peer is greater than if it came from you, the instructor.</p>
<p>Be sure to ask your students this question: &quot;Why is this type of circuit commonly called a <em>current divider</em>?&quot;</p>
