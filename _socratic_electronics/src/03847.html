<p>A <em>comparator</em> may be thought of as a one-bit analog-to-digital converter:</p>

<p>Explain why this description of a comparator is appropriate. What exactly is meant by the term &quot;analog-to-digital converter,&quot; or ADC?</p>
<p>All ADCs input one or more analog signals and output a discrete signal.</p>
<p>This description of a comparator is not just theoretical. In many practical ADC circuits, a comparator is actually used as the primary analog-to-digital conversion device. This is particularly true for <em>oversampling</em> or <em>Sigma-Delta</em> converters, which may be built around a single (1-bit) comparator.</p>
