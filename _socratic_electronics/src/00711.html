<p>Most introductory textbooks will tell you that a silicon PN junction drops 0.7 volts when forward-biased, and a germanium PN junction drops 0.3 volts when forward biased. Design a circuit that tests the &quot;forward voltage&quot; (<span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>F</em></sub></span>) of a PN-junction diode, so you may measure the voltage yourself, without the use of a special diode-testing meter.</p>

<p>Ask your students how they would determine the size of resistor to use for this &quot;diode test&quot; circuit. Would be permissible to use any arbitrary value of resistor, or does the value matter significantly?</p>
