<p>Large electric motors are often equipped with some form of <em>soft-start</em> control, which applies power gradually instead of all at once (as in <em>&quot;across the line&quot;</em> starting). Here is an example of a simple &quot;soft start&quot; control system:</p>

<p>Analyze this ladder logic diagram, and explain how it starts up the electric motor more gently than an &quot;across-the-line&quot; starter would.</p>
<p>In this system, resistors limit the motorâ€™s line current during the initial start-up period, and then are bypassed after the time delay relay times out.</p>
<p>After being accustomed to seeing resistors drawn as zig-zag symbols, it may take some students a few moments to realize the &quot;square wave&quot; components in the motor power diagram are actually resistors. Confusing? Yes, but this is the standard symbolism for ladder-logic diagrams!</p>
