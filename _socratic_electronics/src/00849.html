<p>The mathematical inverse, or reciprocal, of resistance (<span class="math"><em>R</em></span>) is a quantity called <em>conductance</em> (<span class="math"><em>G</em></span>).</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$G = {1 \over R}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Is there an equivalent quantity for impedance (<span class="math"><em>Z</em></span>)? What is the reciprocal of impedance, and what unit of measurement is it expressed in? Hint: its symbol is <span class="math"><em>Y</em></span>.</p>
<p>Is there an equivalent quantity for reactance (<span class="math"><em>X</em></span>)? What is the reciprocal of reactance, and what unit of measurement is it expressed in? Hint: its symbol is <span class="math"><em>B</em></span>.</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>Y</em> = </span> <em>admittance</em>, which is the reciprocal of impedance.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$Y = {1 \over Z}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Admittance is expressed in the unit of <em>siemens</em>.</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>B</em> = </span> <em>susceptance</em>, which is the reciprocal of reactance.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$B = {1 \over X}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Susceptance is also expressed in the unit of <em>siemens</em>.</p>
<p>Ask your students where they obtained this information. Also ask them what the old (pre-siemens) unit of measurement was.</p>
<p>Where would such quantities be useful in AC circuit calculations? Ask your students where the quantity of conductance (<span class="math"><em>G</em></span>) is useful in DC circuit calculations.</p>
