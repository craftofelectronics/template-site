<p>Determine the <em>two’s complement</em> of the binary number <span class="math">01100101<sub>2</sub></span>. Explain how you did the conversion, step by step.</p>
<p>Next, determine the two’s complement representation of the quantity <em>five</em> for a digital system where all numbers are represented by four bits, and also for a digital system where all numbers are represented by eight bits (one <em>byte</em>). Identify the difference that &quot;word length&quot; (the number of bits allocated to represent quantities in a particular digital system) makes in determining the two’s complement of any number.</p>
<p>The two’s complement of <span class="math">01100101</span> is <span class="math">10011011</span>.</p>
<p>The two’s complement of five is <span class="math">1011</span> in the four-bit system. It is <span class="math">11111011</span> in the eight-bit system.</p>
<p>The point about word-length is extremely important. One cannot arrive at a definite two’s complement for any number unless the word length is first known!</p>
