<p>Calculate the power gain of this circuit, if R1 has a resistance of 1 k<span class="math">Ω </span>, R2 has a resistance of 5.1 k<span class="math">Ω </span>, and the load has a resistance of 10 k<span class="math">Ω </span>:</p>

<p>Follow-up question: what <em>unit</em> does this figure have, if any?</p>
<p>Students should readily recognize this circuit from their education in basic DC circuits. Though it may seem strange to calculate the &quot;gain&quot; of a completely passive and indeed <em>dissipative</em> circuit, it is entirely valid.</p>
<p>Discuss with your students the maximum and minimum possible power gain values for a circuit of this type. Also discuss with them the nature of ratios with regard to units.</p>
