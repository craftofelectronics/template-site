<p>Explain how a shift register circuit could be built from D-type flip-flops with the ability to shift data either to the right or to the left, on command. I’m not necessarily asking for a schematic diagram so much as I’m looking for an <em>explanation</em> of how such a circuit might be built. Of course, if your best way of presenting your idea is to draw a schematic diagram, go ahead!</p>
<p>In order to provide <em>bidirectional</em> shift direction ability to a shift register circuit, you will probably have to use <em>steering gates</em> to direct the flip-flop outputs to different flip-flop inputs. I’ll leave the details for you to research and explain!</p>
<p>I purposely avoided asking a question about schematics for a reason: it is too easy to simply look through a textbook or research a datasheet and copy a drawing. What is most important here is that students comprehend <em>how</em> bidirectionality is achieved in shift register circuits. What, exactly, is a <em>steering gate</em>, why are they used, and what in/out flip-flop connections are needed to achieve a desired shift direction.</p>
