<p>The following ladder logic diagram is for a reversing motor control circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03148x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Study this diagram, then explain how motor reversal is accomplished. Also, identify the function of each &quot;M&quot; contact in the control circuit, especially those normally-closed contacts in series with the motor starter coils.</p>
<p>Now consider the following modification made to the reversing motor control circuit (motor and power contacts not shown here):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03148x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>What extra functionality do the time-delay relays contribute to this motor control circuit?</p>
<p>The normally-open and normally-closed &quot;M&quot; contacts provide seal-in and interlock functions, respectively. The time-delay relays prevent the motor from being <em>immediately</em> reversed.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: figure out how to simplify the time-delay relay circuit. Hint: integrate the time-delay and interlocking functions into a single contact (per rung).</p>
<p>This circuit provides students an opportunity to analyze the workings of a delayed-start, reversing motor control circuit. Have your students present both their analyses and the methods behind the analyses as you work through this question with them.</p>
