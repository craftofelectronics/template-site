<p>Implement the following Boolean expression in the form of a digital logic circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\overline{(\overline{AB} + C)B}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Form the circuit by making the necessary connections between pins of these integrated circuits on a solderless breadboard:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01309x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The circuit shown is not the only possible solution to this problem:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01309x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>First things first: did students remember to include the power supply connections to each IC? This is a very common mistake!</p>
<p>In order to successfully develop a solution to this problem, of course, students must research the &quot;pinouts&quot; of each integrated circuit. If most students simply present the answer shown to them in the worksheet, challenge them during discussion to present alternative solutions.</p>
<p>Also, ask them this question: &quot;should we connect the unused inputs to either ground or <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>C</em><em>C</em></sub></span>, or is it permissible to leave the inputs floating?&quot; Students should not just give an answer to this question, but be able to support their answer(s) with reasoning based on the construction of this type of logic circuit.</p>
