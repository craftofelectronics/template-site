<p>We know at this point that any circuit comprised of inductance (<span class="math"><em>L</em></span>) and capacitance (<span class="math"><em>C</em></span>) is capable of <em>resonating</em>: attaining large values of AC voltage and current if &quot;excited&quot; at the proper frequency. The so-called <em>tank circuit</em> is the simplest example of this:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03461x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The less resistance (<span class="math"><em>R</em></span>) such a circuit has, the better its ability to resonate.</p>
<p>We also know that any piece of wire contains both inductance and capacitance, distributed along its length. These properties are not necessarily intentional – they exist whether we would want them to or not:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03461x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Given that the electrical resistance of a continuous piece of metal wire is usually quite low, describe what these natural properties of inductance and capacitance mean with regard to that wire’s function as an electrical element.</p>
<p>The fact that an piece of wire contains both inductance and capacitance means that it has the ability to resonate just like any tank circuit!</p>
<p>Follow-up question: qualitatively estimate the frequency you suppose a length of wire would resonate at. Do you think <span class="math"><em>f</em><sub><em>r</em></sub></span> would be a very low value (tens of hertz), a very high value (thousands, millions, or billions of hertz), or somewhere in between? Keep in mind the equation for resonant frequency:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$f_r = {1 \over {2 \pi \sqrt{LC}}}$</span><br /></p>
<p>If your students have difficulty knowing where to start with the follow-up question, ask them to qualitatively estimate the distributed <span class="math"><em>L</em></span> and <span class="math"><em>C</em></span> for a piece of wire, say, 10 feet long. Given the lack of any high-permeability core material and the lack of any high-permittivity dielectric (just air), the answers for both should be &quot;very small.&quot; Then, ask them again how they would qualitatively rate the wire’s resonant frequency.</p>
