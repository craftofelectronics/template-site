<p>All electrical sources contain some internal impedance. This explains why voltage sources &quot;sag&quot; when placed under load:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00662x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>In this diagram, the source’s internal impedance has been &quot;lumped&quot; into a single component, labeled <span class="math"><em>Z</em><sub><em>T</em><em>h</em></sub></span>, the Thévenin impedance. This intrinsic impedance naturally limits the amount of power any source can deliver to a load. It also creates a condition where load power is optimized at a particular load impedance.</p>
<p>Determine the load impedance value necessary for maximum power dissipation, if powered by an audio amplifier circuit with an internal (Thévenin) impedance of 4 <span class="math">Ω </span>.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00662x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math"><em>Z</em><sub><em>l</em><em>o</em><em>a</em><em>d</em></sub></span> (ideal) = 4 <span class="math">Ω </span></p>
<p>Discuss with your students the &quot;Maximum Power Transfer Theorem&quot; as it relates to this question.</p>
