<p>Note that the LEDs shown in the schematic do not have voltage-dropping resistors connected in series. How is this possible, especially considering the author’s prototype circuit operated at 12 volts DC (far in excess of an LED’s continuous rating)?</p>
<p>Since the LEDs only turn on during the discharge phase of the 555’s timing cycle (which is very short), greater-than-rated voltages and currents are permissible.</p>
<p>This question illustrates how the advertised ratings of electronic components assume certain conditions. If one understands what these assumptions are, the component ratings may be safely &quot;exceeded&quot; under special conditions. This is one such special case.</p>
