<p>What effect does doping concentration have on the electrical conductivity of an extrinsic semiconductor?</p>
<p>The more concentrated the &quot;doping,&quot; the greater the conductivity of the material.</p>
<p>A couple of technical terms are used in this question (doping, extrinsic). Be sure to ask your students what they mean, if only for the sake of review. Also, ask your students to relate their answer in terms of charge carriers.</p>
