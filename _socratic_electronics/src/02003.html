<p>Explain what the <em>Fermi level</em> is for a substance.</p>
<p>The &quot;Fermi level&quot; is the highest energy level that electrons will attain in a substance at a temperature of absolute zero.</p>
<p>It is sometimes helpful to use analogies for illustrative purposes. An analogy for Fermi level is to imagine a pot of boiling water, where water molecules represent electrons and height represents energy level. Under ambient temperature conditions, there are many water molecules (electrons) leaving the liquid surface, and some that are returning to it. Cool the pot below the boiling point, however, and all the water molecules return to the liquid where the uppermost level represents the Fermi level in a substance.</p>
