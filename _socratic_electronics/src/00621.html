<p>Suppose this band-stop filter were to suddenly start acting as a high-pass filter. Identify a single component failure that could cause this problem to occur:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00621x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>If resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>3</sub></span> failed open, it would cause this problem. However, this is not the <em>only</em> failure that could cause the same type of problem!</p>
<p>Ask your students to explain why an open <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span> would cause this filter to act as a high-pass instead of a band-stop. Then, ask them to identify other possible component failures that could cause a similar effect.</p>
<p>By the way, this filter circuit illustrates the popular <em>twin-tee</em> filter topology.</p>
