<p>Bipolar junction transistors (BJTs) are considered &quot;normally-off&quot; devices, because their natural state with no signal applied to the base is no conduction between emitter and collector, like an open switch. Are junction field-effect transistors (JFETs) considered the same? Why or why not?</p>
<p>JFETs are &quot;normally-on&quot; devices.</p>
<p>Ask your students to elaborate on the answer given. Do not accept a mindless recitation of the answer, &quot;JFETs are normally-on devices,&quot; but rather demand that some sort of explanation be given as to <em>why</em> JFETs are normally-on devices.</p>
