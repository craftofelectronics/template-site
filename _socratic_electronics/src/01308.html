<p>An engineer hands you a piece of paper with the following Boolean expression on it, and tells you to build a gate circuit to perform that function:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$A\overline{B} + \overline{C}(A + B)$</span><br /></p>
<p>Draw a logic gate circuit for this function.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01308x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The process of converting Boolean expressions into logic gate circuits is not quite as simple as converting gate circuits into Boolean expressions, but it is manageable. Have your students share whatever methods or &quot;tricks&quot; they use to write the expressions with the rest of the class.</p>
