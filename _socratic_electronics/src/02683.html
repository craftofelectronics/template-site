<p>Examine this progression of mathematical statements:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">(100)(1000) = 100000</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">(100)(1000) = 10<sup>5</sup></span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">log[(100)(1000)] = log10<sup>5</sup></span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">log100 + log1000 = log10<sup>5</sup></span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">log10<sup>2</sup> + log10<sup>3</sup> = log10<sup>5</sup></span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">2 + 3 = 5</span><br /></p>
<p>What began as a multiplication problem ended up as an addition problem, through the application of logarithms. What does this tell you about the utility of logarithms as an arithmetic tool?</p>
<p>That logarithms can reduce the complexity of an equation from multiplication, down to addition, indicates its usefulness as a tool to <em>simplify</em> arithmetic problems. Specifically, the logarithm of a product is equal to the sum of the logarithms of the two numbers being multiplied.</p>
<p>In mathematics, any procedure that reduces a complex type of problem into a simpler type of problem is called a <em>transform function</em>, and logarithms are one of the simplest types of transform functions in existence.</p>
