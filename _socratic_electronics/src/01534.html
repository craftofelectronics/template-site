<p>Your amplifier design will almost certainly require more than one stage of transistors to properly match the impedance of the microphone to that of the loudspeaker. Identify the topology of each transistor stage (common-emitter, common-collector, common-base, etc.), and explain what the primary form of gain for each stage is (voltage gain, or current gain).</p>
<p>The answer to this question, of course, will vary with your particular design of circuit.</p>
<p>A project such as this really brings to life the concepts of gain, and why different transistor amplifier configurations are necessary to achieve different types of gains.</p>
