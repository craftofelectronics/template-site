<p>Calculate the output voltages of these two voltage divider circuits (<span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>A</em></sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>B</em></sub></span>):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01725x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Now, calculate the voltage between points <strong>A</strong> (red lead) and <strong>B</strong> (black lead) (<span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>A</em><em>B</em></sub></span>).</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>A</em></sub> = </span> + 65.28 V</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>B</em></sub> = </span> + 23.26 V</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>A</em><em>B</em></sub> = </span> + 42.02 V (point <strong>A</strong> being positive relative to point <strong>B</strong>)</p>
<p>Challenge question: what would change if the wire connecting the two voltage divider circuits together were removed?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01725x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>In this question, I want students to see how the voltage between the two dividers’ output terminals is the difference between their individual output voltages. I also want students to see the notation used to denote the voltages (use of subscripts, with an applied reference point of ground). Although voltage is <em>always and forever</em> a quantity between two points, it is appropriate to speak of voltage being &quot;at&quot; a single point in a circuit if there is an implied point of reference (ground).</p>
<p>It is possible to solve for <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>A</em><em>B</em></sub></span> without formally appealing to Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law. One way I’ve found helpful to students is to envision the two voltages (<span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>A</em></sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>B</em></sub></span>) as heights of objects, asking the question of &quot;How much height <em>difference</em> is there between the two objects?&quot;</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01725x03.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The height of each object is analogous to the voltage dropped across each of the lower resistors in the voltage divider circuits. Like voltage, height is a quantity measured <em>between two points</em> (the top of the object and ground level). Also like the voltage <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>A</em><em>B</em></sub></span>, the difference in height between the two objects is a measurement taken between two points, and it is also found by subtraction.</p>
