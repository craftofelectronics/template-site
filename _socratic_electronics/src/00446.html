<p>Match the following bipolar transistor illustrations to their respective schematic symbols:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00446x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00446x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Follow-up question: identify the terminals on each transistor schematic symbol (base, emitter, and collector).</p>
<p>Be sure to ask your students which of these transistor symbols represents the &quot;NPN&quot; type and which represents the &quot;PNP&quot; type. Although it will be obvious to most from the &quot;sandwich&quot; illustrations showing layers of &quot;P&quot; and &quot;N&quot; type material, this fact may escape the notice of a few students.</p>
<p>It might help to review diode symbols, if some students experience difficulty in matching the designations (PNP versus NPN) with the schematic symbols.</p>
