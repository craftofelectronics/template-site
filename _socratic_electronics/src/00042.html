<p>A technician wants to energize a 24 volt motor, but lacks a 24 volt battery to do it with. Instead, she has access to several &quot;power supply&quot; units which convert 120 volt AC power from a power receptacle into low-voltage DC power that is adjustable over a range of 0 to 15 volts. Each of these power supplies is a box with a power cord, voltage adjustment knob, and two output terminals for connection with the DC voltage it produces:</p>

<p>Draw a picture of how this technician might use power supplies to energize the 24 volt motor.</p>
<p>This is perhaps the most direct solution (setting each power supply to output 12 volts):</p>

<p>Although this is a very simple and direct solution, it is not the only possible one. Incidentally, this scenario is very common in electronics work: having to couple multiple power supplies together to achieve a desired total voltage or total current.</p>
