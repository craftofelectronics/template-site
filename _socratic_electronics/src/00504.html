<p>This bridge circuit is suppose to generate an output voltage proportional to the <em>difference</em> between light exposure on the two photocells:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00504x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>However something has failed in this circuit, because the voltmeter is &quot;pegged&quot; fully negative and will not change with varying light exposures on the two cells. Identify at least two possible failures that could cause the voltmeter to over-range in the negative direction.</p>
<p>Here are two failures, although they are not the only possibilities:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> could have failed shorted.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Photocell <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>3</sub></span> could have failed open.</p>
<p>Be sure to ask your students to describe failures <em>other</em> than the two mentioned in the answer. And, for all answers given, be sure to ask students how they determined those faults would cause the observed &quot;negative pegging&quot; of the voltmeter. As usual, the method of solution is much more important than the actual answer in this question.</p>
