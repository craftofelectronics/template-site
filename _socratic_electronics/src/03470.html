<p>Use circuit simulation software to verify your predicted and measured parameter values.</p>
<p>Use a variable-voltage, regulated power supply for <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>t</em><em>h</em><em>e</em><em>v</em><em>e</em><em>n</em><em>i</em><em>n</em></sub></span>, and a fixed-voltage supply for <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>s</em><em>o</em><em>u</em><em>r</em><em>c</em><em>e</em></sub></span>. Specify standard resistor values, all between 1 k<span class="math">Ω </span> and 100 k<span class="math">Ω </span> (1k5, 2k2, 2k7, 3k3, 4k7, 5k1, 6k8, 10k, 22k, 33k, 39k 47k, 68k, etc.) for resistors in the original circuit. A decade box or potentiometer will suffice for <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>t</em><em>h</em><em>e</em><em>v</em><em>e</em><em>n</em><em>i</em><em>n</em></sub></span>.</p>
<p>In case it is not already crystal-clear, I want students to build <em>two different circuits</em> for this exercise: the &quot;original&quot; circuit and also a &quot;Thevenin equivalent&quot; circuit, then plug the exact same load resistor into both circuits (one at a time) to see that the voltage across it is the same in both cases. Many students seem to struggle with the basic concept of equivalent circuits, and I have found this exercise (once successfully completed) to be excellent for &quot;making it real&quot; to these students.</p>
<p>An extension of this exercise is to incorporate troubleshooting questions. Whether using this exercise as a performance assessment or simply as a concept-building lab, you might want to follow up your students’ results by asking them to predict the consequences of certain circuit faults.</p>
