<p>Explain the difference between <em>static</em> RAM (&quot;SRAM&quot;) and <em>dynamic</em> RAM (&quot;DRAM&quot;) memory technologies. Which type of memory technology provides faster access of data, and why? Which type of memory technology provides the greatest storage density, and why?</p>
<p>Static RAM provides the fastest access, while dynamic RAM provides the greatest amount of memory per physical volume (storage density).</p>
<p>Follow-up question: how is <em>refreshing</em> provided for dynamic RAM chips? Is this something taken care of internal to the chip, or must the circuit designer provide external circuitry to refresh the dynamic RAM chipâ€™s memory cells?</p>
<p>Ask your students where they obtained their information on static versus dynamic RAM technologies. Extra credit for consulting datasheets!</p>
