<p>Suppose 1200 turns of copper wire are wrapped around one portion of an iron hoop, and 3000 turns of wire are wrapped around another portion of that same hoop. If the 1200-turn coil is energized with 15 volts AC (RMS), how much voltage will appear between the ends of the 3000-turn coil?</p>
<p>37.5 volts AC, RMS.</p>
<p>Transformer winding calculations are simply an exercise in mathematical ratios. If your students are not strong in their ratio skills, this question provides an application to sharpen them!</p>
