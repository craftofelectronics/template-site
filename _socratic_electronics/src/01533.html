<p>Explain how you plan to test for and eliminate (if necessary) any <em>crossover distortion</em> from your amplifier circuit. Do you suspect crossover distortion will be more noticeable at low volume levels or high volume levels? Explain why.</p>
<p>Crossover distortion is detected by using an oscilloscope to display the output waveform, and is eliminated through proper biasing of the push-pull transistor pair. This type of distortion is generally more noticeable at low volume levels, but Iâ€™ll let you explain exactly why!</p>
<p>Crossover distortion is the bane of Class B amplifier designs, and may be frustrating for the beginning electronics student to successfully eliminate without causing other problems (such as transistor overheating from excessive Class AB biasing).</p>
