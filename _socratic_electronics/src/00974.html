<p>One way to greatly boost the current gain (<span class="math"><em>A</em><sub><em>I</em></sub></span>) of a Class B push-pull amplifier is to use <em>Darlington pairs</em> instead of single transistors:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00974x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The only problem with the Darlington pair amplifier circuit shown is that the original biasing network will no longer be sufficient. Unless something else is changed in this circuit, the amplifier will exhibit some crossover distortion.</p>
<p>Draw the necessary modifications to the circuit to properly bias the new transistors, and explain why these modifications are necessary.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00974x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Ask your students to estimate the additional biasing voltage necessary with the two (new) transistors added to the circuit. How much biasing voltage, per transistor, was necessary with just two transistors in the circuit? Now that four transistors are in the circuit, how much more biasing voltage is necessary to avoid crossover distortion?</p>
