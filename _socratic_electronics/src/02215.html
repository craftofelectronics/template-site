<p>Calculate the number of turns needed in the secondary winding of a transformer to transform a primary voltage of 300 volts down to a secondary voltage of 180 volts, if the primary winding has 1150 turns of wire.</p>

<p><span class="math"><em>N</em><sub><em>s</em><em>e</em><em>c</em><em>o</em><em>n</em><em>d</em><em>a</em><em>r</em><em>y</em></sub></span> = 690 turns</p>
<p>Most transformer problems are nothing more than ratios, but some students find ratios difficult to handle. Questions such as this are great for having students come up to the board in the front of the classroom and demonstrating how they obtained the results.</p>
