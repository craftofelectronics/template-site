<p>An electronics student builds an amplified CD (stereo) player, but needs to find the correct transformers to impedance-match the 16 <span class="math">Ω </span> speakers to the 1 k<span class="math">Ω </span> amplifier outputs for maximum power output:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03664x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Calculate the necessary winding turns ratio (<span class="math">$N_p \over N_s$</span>) for these transformers, and also the number of secondary turns necessary (rounded to the nearest whole turn) if the primary winding of each has 2100 turns:</p>
<p>Turns ratio (<span class="math">$N_p \over N_s$</span>) = Secondary turns (<span class="math"><em>N</em><sub><em>s</em></sub></span>) =</p>
<p>Turns ratio (<span class="math">$N_p \over N_s$</span>) = 7.91 : 1 Secondary turns (<span class="math"><em>N</em><sub><em>s</em></sub></span>) = 266</p>
