<p>The purpose of this question is to get students thinking in terms of &quot;digital&quot; quantities, which by their very nature are non-continuous. It is important to note that the concepts of continuous and discrete quantities are not limited to electronics, but are found in a variety of places in every-day life.</p>
<p>It should be noted that some of these determinations are subjective. The voltage output by a comparator may be considered discrete on a large time scale, but there is a measurable transition from &quot;high&quot; voltage to &quot;low&quot; voltage in which the output voltage is somewhere between full saturation limits.</p>
