<p>A problem unique to certain types of CMOS logic gates is something called <em>SCR latchup</em>. This is an abnormal condition capable of ruining a circuit, or at the very least causing operational problems in a circuit. Explain what this phenomenon is, and what causes it.</p>
<p>If an input or output of a CMOS gate circuit is driven above <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>D</em><em>D</em></sub></span>, even momentarily, the circuit may &quot;latch&quot; like an SCR, causing <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>D</em><em>D</em></sub></span> to become shorted to <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>S</em><em>S</em></sub></span> internally. This is made possible by the way CMOS transistors are manufactured on the integrated circuit’s substrate.</p>
<p>Challenge question: referencing a cross-sectional illustration of a CMOS gate integrated circuit, show the &quot;SCR&quot; formed by the transistors, and explain how it may be &quot;fired&quot; by excessive input voltage to the gate.</p>
<p>Based on their knowledge of thyristors, your students should be able to tell you how to best &quot;unlatch&quot; a CMOS gate stuck in this condition. Challenge them with this problem, and also with the question of how one might detect such a condition as it’s happening.</p>
<p>Mention to your students that not all CMOS families exhibit this problem, and that manufacturers have been keen to address serious design faults such as these. If nothing else, though, this should reinforce the lesson that one should <em>never</em> exceed the supply rail voltage for any type of active circuit, be it an op-amp, gate, or something else, unless expressly permitted by the manufacturer.</p>
