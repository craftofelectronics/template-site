<p>A technician decides to check a suspect three-input AND gate using a logic pulser. She touches the logic pulser to each input of the AND gate, while looking for a pulsing signal at the output with a logic probe.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03840x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>No matter which input test point (TP1, TP2, or TP3) she pulses, though, the output test point (TP4) always reads low. Does this prove the AND gate to be defective? Explain why or why not.</p>
<p>The AND gate may be bad, or it may be good. The test as described is inconclusive.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: what would have to be checked to make the described test procedure valid?</p>
<p>This is a very practical question, as it requires students to carefully consider what a three-input AND gate <em>ought</em> to do under normal conditions, and how to set up a test that is indeed valid.</p>
