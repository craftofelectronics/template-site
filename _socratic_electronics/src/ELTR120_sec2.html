<p>It is vitally important for students to understand the conditions necessary for transistor operation, both for understanding how circuits work and for troubleshooting faulty circuits. Bipolar junction transistors require a base current (in the proper direction) to conduct, and the collector-to-emitter voltage must be of the correct polarity to push a collector current in the proper direction as well. Both currents join at the emitter terminal, making the emitter current the sum of the base and collector currents. Field-effect transistors are not so picky about the direction of the controlled current, and they only require the correct gate voltage (no gate current) to establish conduction. What makes this so confusing is that there are two types of bipolar transistors (NPN and PNP), two types of junction field-effect transistors (N-channel and P-channel), and four types of MOSFETs (E-type N-channel, E-type P-channel, D-type N-channel, and D-type P-channel).</p>
<p>It is very common in electronics work to refer to current-controlling devices as either <em>sourcing</em> current to a load or <em>sinking</em> current from a load. This is an overt reference to conventional-flow notation, referring to whether the conventional flow moves <em>out</em> of the transistor from the positive power supply terminal to the load (sourcing), or whether the conventional flow moves <em>in</em> to the transistor from the load and then &quot;down&quot; to ground (sinking). Some students grasp this concept readily, while others seem to struggle mightily with it. It is something rather essential to understand, because this terminology is extensively used by electronics professionals and found in electronics literature. The key detail distinguishing the two conditions is which power supply rail (either +V or Gnd) is <em>directly</em> connected to the current-controlling device.</p>
