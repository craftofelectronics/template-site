<p>Suppose you were troubleshooting the following amplifier circuit, and found the output signal to be &quot;clipped&quot; on the negative peaks:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01581x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01581x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>If you knew that this amplifier was a new design, and might not have all its components properly sized, what type of problem would you suspect in the circuit? Please be as specific as possible.</p>
<p>This amplifier most likely suffers from improper biasing, which may be remedied by changing the value of <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> or <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span>. (I’ll let you determine which way the chosen resistor value must be altered, increase or decrease!)</p>
<p>Discuss with your students how to determine whether the bias voltage is too great or too small, based on the observed output waveform. It isn’t difficult to do so long as students understand <em>why</em> biasing exists and how it works.</p>
