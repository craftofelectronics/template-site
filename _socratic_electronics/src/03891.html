<p>Identify at least one component fault that would cause the &quot;<span class="math"><em>Q</em></span>&quot; LED to always stay on, no matter what was done with the input switches.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03891x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>For each of your proposed faults, explain <em>why</em> it will cause the described problem.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> NOR gate <span class="math"><em>U</em><sub>2</sub></span> output failed high.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Wire break between &quot;Reset&quot; switch and resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span> (although if this was the only fault it may allow the <span class="math"><em>Q</em></span> LED to energize at power-up, just not de-energize after the &quot;Set&quot; button had been pressed).</p>
<p>Follow-up question: explain why the nature of the problem rules out the possibility of the only fault being something related to the feedback connections between <span class="math"><em>U</em><sub>1</sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>U</em><sub>2</sub></span>.</p>
<p>Latch circuits can be confusing due to their use of positive feedback. Questions such as this are important tools for helping develop your students’ understanding of latch circuits.</p>
