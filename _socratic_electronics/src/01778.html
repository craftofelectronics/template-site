<p>Size the resistor in this voltage divider circuit to provide 3.2 volts to the load, assuming that the load will draw 10 mA of current at this voltage:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01778x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>As part of your design, include the power dissipation ratings of both resistors.</p>
<p>R = 1 k<span class="math">Ω </span>. The 470 <span class="math">Ω </span> resistor will fare well even with a (low) power dissipation rating of <span class="math">${1 \over 8}$</span> watt, though the 1 k<span class="math">Ω </span> resistor will need to be rated in excess of 1/4 watt.</p>
<p>Ask your students what would change in this divider circuit if the load were to suddenly draw more, or less, current.</p>
