<p>How could a battery, a light bulb, and some lengths of metal wire be used as a <em>conductivity tester</em>, to test the ability of different objects to conduct electricity?</p>
<p>The following circuit would function as a simple continuity tester. Simply place the open wire ends in contact with the object to be tested, and the light bulb will indicate whether or not the object conducts electricity to any substantial degree:</p>

<p>Not only is this question an opportunity to solve a problem, but it lends itself well to simple and safe experimentation. Encourage students to build their own conductivity testers and test various substances with them.</p>
