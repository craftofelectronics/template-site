<p>Complete truth tables for the following gates, and also write the Boolean expression for each gate:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01314x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The results should be obvious once the truth tables are both complete. Is there a general principle at work here? Do you think we would obtain similar results with Negative-OR and NAND gates? Explain.</p>

<p>Negative-AND gate: <span class="math">$\overline{A} \&gt; \overline{B}$</span></p>
<p>NOR gate: <span class="math">$\overline{A + B}$</span></p>
<p>Just a preview of DeMorganâ€™s Theorem here!</p>
