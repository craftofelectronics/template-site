<p>The Q factor of a series inductive circuit is given by the following equation:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$Q = {X_L \over R_{series}}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Likewise, we know that inductive reactance may be found by the following equation:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math"><em>X</em><sub><em>L</em></sub> = 2<em>π</em><em>f</em><em>L</em></span><br /></p>
<p>We also know that the resonant frequency of a series LC circuit is given by this equation:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$f_r = {1 \over {2 \pi \sqrt{LC}}}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Through algebraic substitution, write an equation that gives the Q factor of a series resonant LC circuit exclusively in terms of <span class="math"><em>L</em></span>, <span class="math"><em>C</em></span>, and <span class="math"><em>R</em></span>, without reference to reactance (<span class="math"><em>X</em></span>) or frequency (<span class="math"><em>f</em></span>).</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$Q = {1 \over R} \sqrt{L \over C}$</span><br /></p>
<p>This is merely an exercise in algebra. However, knowing how these three component values affects the Q factor of a resonant circuit is a valuable and practical insight!</p>
