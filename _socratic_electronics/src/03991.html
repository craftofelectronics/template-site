<p>Many microcontrollers come equipped with a built-in PWM function, so that you do not have to code a custom PWM algorithm yourself. This fact points to the popularity of pulse-width modulation as a control scheme. Explain why PWM is so popular, and give a few practical examples of how it may be used.</p>
<p>Iâ€™ll let you do your own research for this question! The answer(s) is/are not hard to find.</p>
<p>Pulse-width modulation (PWM) is a very common and useful way of generating an analog output from a microcontroller (or other digital electronic circuit) capable only of &quot;high&quot; and &quot;low&quot; voltage level output. With PWM, time (or more specifically, <em>duty cycle</em>) is the analog domain, while amplitude is the digital domain. This allows us to &quot;sneak&quot; an analog signal through a digital (on-off) data channel.</p>
