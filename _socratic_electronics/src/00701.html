<p>In this passive filter circuit, how will the filter’s cutoff frequency be affected by changes in the load resistance? Be as specific as you can in your answer.</p>

<p><span class="math"><em>f</em><sub><em>c</em><em>u</em><em>t</em><em>o</em><em>f</em><em>f</em></sub></span> will increase as the load resistance decreases.</p>
<p>Ask your students to define what &quot;cutoff frequency&quot; means. There is more than one definition: one based on output voltage, and one based on output power. When defined in terms of power, the cutoff frequency is sometimes described as <span class="math"><em>f</em><sub> − 3<em>d</em><em>B</em></sub></span>.</p>
