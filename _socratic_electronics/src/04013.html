<p>Pulse-density modulation (PDM) is closely related to pulse-width modulation (PWM). Describe the similarities and differences in your own words.</p>
<p>PWM is a truly analog modulation format, where PDM is truly digital. In other words, the resolution of PWM is infinite, whereas the resolution of PDM is finite.</p>
<p>It should be noted that either pulse stream may be converted into an analog voltage by low-pass filtering, which makes both of these modulation formats very useful.</p>
