<p>Calculate the necessary resistor value (<span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span>) in this circuit to give it a voltage gain of 30:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02725x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> = 1.345 k<span class="math">Ω </span></p>
<p>Ask your students how they solved this problem, especially since it is fairly safe to say that they didn’t find the equation directly solving for <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> in any book. Algebraic manipulation is necessary to take the standard voltage gain equation and put it into a form suitable for use answering this question.</p>
