<p>A very useful MOSFET circuit is the <em>bilateral switch</em>, an example shown here for you to analyze:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01132x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The &quot;dual inverter&quot; circuit simply ensures the two control lines A and B will always be opposite polarities (one at <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>d</em><em>d</em></sub></span> potential, the other at ground potential).</p>
<p>What is the purpose of a &quot;bilateral switch&quot; circuit? Hint: there are two integrated circuit implementations of the bilateral switch – the 4016 and the 4066. Investigate the datasheets for these integrated circuits to learn more!</p>
<p>I’ll let you research this one yourself!</p>
<p>If your students have not yet learned about digital transistor circuits, this would be a good time to introduce the concept of &quot;high&quot; and &quot;low&quot; logic states, in this case as control signals to the bilateral switch cell.</p>
<p>Ask your students what the purpose of a bilateral switch might be, since we already have mechanical switches capable of switching almost any type of electrical signal known.</p>
