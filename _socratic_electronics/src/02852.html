<p>What factors determine where potentiometers <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>p</em><em>o</em><em>t</em>1</sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>p</em><em>o</em><em>t</em>2</sub></span> must be set? Why are they &quot;trimmer&quot; potentiometers (as indicated by the special wiper symbol) and not regular panel-mount potentiometers?</p>
<p>The acceptable &quot;high&quot; and &quot;low&quot; voltage levels for which ever logic family is being trouble-shot will dictate where these potentiometers must be set.</p>
<p>Do <em>not</em> simply tell your students what these acceptable voltage levels are! Let them research datasheets for instances of logic gates within the logic family desired, and let the manufacturersâ€™ data tell them what they need to know.</p>
