<p>A technician prepares to use an oscilloscope to display an AC voltage signal. After turning the oscilloscope on and connecting the Y input probe to the signal source test points, this display appears:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00535x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>What display control(s) need to be adjusted on the oscilloscope in order to show a normal-looking wave on the screen?</p>
<p>The &quot;timebase&quot; control needs to be adjusted for a greater number of seconds per division.</p>
<p>Discuss the function of both these controls with your students. If possible, demonstrate this scenario using a real oscilloscope and function generator, and have students adjust the controls to get the waveform to display optimally. Challenge your students to think of ways the <em>signal source</em> (function generator) may be adjusted to produce the display, then have them think of ways the oscilloscope controls could be adjusted to fit.</p>
