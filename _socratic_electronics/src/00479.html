<p>Write an algebraic equation that solves for the voltage between the two bus conductors, based on the problem-solving method of Th√©venin-to-Norton conversion, combining Norton sources into one, and combining resistors into one:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00479x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$V_{total} = {{V_1 \over R_1} + {V_2 \over R_2} + {V_3 \over R_3} \over {1 \over R_1} + {1 \over R_2} + {1 \over R_3}}$</span><br /></p>
<p>At first it may seem a bit overwhelming to derive an equation from these steps, but it is actually easier than it looks. A hint on how to do it: begin with the last step of the circuit simplification process, and work <em>backwards</em> as you elaborate your equation.</p>
