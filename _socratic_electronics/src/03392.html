<p>Suppose the motor in this circuit refused to run, despite your voltmeter showing that there is 36 volts between points <strong>E</strong> and <strong>J</strong> at the battery:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03392x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Connecting your voltmeter between points <strong>C</strong> and <strong>H</strong> in the circuit, you measure 0 volts. What does this indicate about the location of the fault? Assume there is only <em>one</em> thing wrong with this circuit (no multiple faults!).</p>
<p>The fault must be somewhere to the <em>right</em> of points <strong>C</strong> and <strong>H</strong>.</p>
