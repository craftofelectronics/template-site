<p>Also, determine the following information about this circuit:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Current through each resistor</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Power dissipated by each resistor</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Ratio of each resistor’s voltage drop to battery voltage (<span class="math">$E_R \over E_{bat}$</span>)</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Ratio of each resistor’s resistance to the total circuit resistance (<span class="math">$R \over R_{total}$</span>)</p>
<p>Voltage across each resistor = 1.5 V</p>
<p>Current through each resistor = 1.5 mA</p>
<p>Power dissipated by each resistor = 2.25 mW</p>
<p>Voltage ratio = <span class="math">$1 \over 3$</span></p>
<p>Resistance ratio = <span class="math">$1 \over 3$</span></p>
<p>Follow-up question: are the two ratios’ equality a coincidence? Explain your answer.</p>
<p>When performing the mathematical analysis on this circuit, there is more than one possible sequence of steps to obtaining the solutions. Different students in your class may very well have different solution sequences, and it is a good thing to have students share their differing problem-solving techniques before the whole class.</p>
<p>An important aspect of this question is for students to observe the identical ratios (voltage versus resistance), and determine whether or not these ratios are equal by chance or equal by necessity. Ask your students, &quot;What kind of evidence would prove these ratios were merely equal by chance?&quot; Setting mathematics aside and viewing this circuit from a purely experimental point of view, ask your students what data could possibly prove these ratios to be equal by chance in this particular case? Hint: it would only take a single example to prove this!</p>
