<p>Use DeMorganâ€™s Theorem, as well as any other applicable rules of Boolean algebra, to simplify the following expression so there are no more complementation bars extending over multiple variables:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\overline{ \overline{AB} + \overline{AC} }$</span><br /></p>
<p>Simplified expression:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math"><em>A</em><em>B</em><em>C</em></span><br /></p>
<p>Have your students demonstrate exactly what they did (step by step) to simplify this expression, sharing their problem-solving strategies with the whole class.</p>
