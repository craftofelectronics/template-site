<p>Complete the wire connections necessary to make this a bridge circuit, where <span class="math">${R_1 \over R_2} = {R_3 \over R_4}$</span> at balance:</p>

<p>This, of course, is not the only way to connect the components to make a bridge circuit!</p>

<p>Challenge your students to connect the resistors in a manner different from the diagram shown in the answer, to make a bridge circuit. A good way to do this is to project an image of the original components (with no interconnections drawn) on a whiteboard with a video projector, then have students use dry-erase markers to draw the connecting wires in place. If any errors are made, they can be very easily erased without erasing any components themselves.</p>
