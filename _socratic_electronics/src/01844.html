<p>Write an equation that solves for the impedance of this series circuit. The equation need not solve for the phase angle between voltage and current, but merely provide a scalar figure for impedance (in ohms):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01844x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math">$Z_{total} = \sqrt{R^2 + X^2}$</span></p>
<p>Ask your students if this equation looks similar to any other mathematical equations they’ve seen before. If not, square both sides of the equation so it looks like <span class="math"><em>Z</em><sup>2</sup> = <em>R</em><sup>2</sup> + <em>X</em><sup>2</sup></span> and ask them again.</p>
