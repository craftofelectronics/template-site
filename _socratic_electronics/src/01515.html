<p>Explain how frequency is adjusted in your signal generator circuit. Your circuit should contain both a &quot;coarse&quot; and a &quot;fine&quot; adjustment (the coarse adjustment could be a multi-position switch, to select different frequency ranges).</p>
<p>Frequency adjustment is usually accomplished by means of a resistor/capacitor network. What I’m looking for here is a detailed explanation of how this network functions to control the frequency of oscillation. To answer this, of course, you must have a firm understanding of how the signal generator IC works internally.</p>
<p>Students should be able to find this information in their chips’ datasheet(s).</p>
