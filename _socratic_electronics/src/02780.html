<p>Identify each of these relay logic functions by name (AND, OR, NOR, etc.) and complete their respective truth tables:</p>

<p>In order to familiarize students with standard switch contact configurations, I like to given them practice with identification and truth tables each day. Students need to be able to recognize these ladder logic sub-circuits at a glance, or else they will have difficulty analyzing more complex relay circuits that use them.</p>
