<p>A technician decides to use a potentiometer as a speed control for an electric motor. The potentiometer has a resistance rating of 10 <span class="math">Ω </span> and a power rating of 25 watts:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00340x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>When operating the motor at a voltage of 16 volts and a current of 2 amps, though, smoke begins to pour out of the potentiometer, indicating that its power rating is being exceeded.</p>
<p>The technician is perplexed! According to his calculations, the potentiometer should be dissipating less than 25 watts of power. Why, then, is a potentiometer rated for 25 watts burning up under this condition?</p>
<p>The power rating of a potentiometer is based on the heat dispersing ability of the <em>entire</em> resistive element. The actual power dissipation rating of a potentiometer must be &quot;de-rated&quot; for wiper positions not utilizing the whole length of the resistive element.</p>
<p>Challenge question: based on the voltage and current values measured in this circuit (16 volts across the motor, 24 volts from the source, and 2 amps of current through it all), determine how badly the potentiometer is being overpowered. In other words, calculate the de-rated power rating of the potentiometer and compare that against the amount of power it is actually dissipating in this condition.</p>
<p>A very practical and important lesson, learned after watching students send many potentiometers to an early demise.</p>
<p>In order to answer the challenge question, students must determine the pot’s setting as a percentage between 0% (0 <span class="math">Ω </span>) and 100% (10 <span class="math">Ω </span>), and use that setting to estimate power de-rating. It is safe to assume a linear power derating proportional to wiper position.</p>
