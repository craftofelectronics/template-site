<p>An important integrated circuit (IC) used in digital data communication is a <em>UART</em>. Describe what this acronym stands for, and explain the purpose of this circuit.</p>
<p>&quot;UART&quot; stands for <em>Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter</em>, and its job is to act as an interface between two parallel-data devices, managing communications in serial format along a communication line of some sort.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: give an example of a UART IC available for purchase today.</p>
<p>When students research what a UART is, they will invariably stumble upon terms such as <em>parity</em>, <em>start bit</em>, and <em>stop bit</em>. If they are not yet familiar with the details of asynchronous data communications, this could lead to some enlightening discoveries. Be sure to discuss these terms and details with your students if they bring them up in class, because it means they will be very receptive to your instruction (having been &quot;primed&quot; for learning by <em>wanting</em> to know).</p>
