<p>An important parameter of logic gate circuitry is <em>noise margin</em>. What exactly is &quot;noise margin,&quot; and how is it defined for logic gates?</p>
<p>Specifically, how much noise margin do digital circuits exclusively composed of CMOS gates have? How does this compare with the noise margin of all-TTL circuitry?</p>
<p>Note: you will need to consult CMOS gate datasheets to answer this question properly.</p>
<p>Noise margin is the difference between the acceptable voltage limits for corresponding input and output logic states.</p>
<p>This question, to be answered properly, involves more than just a definition of &quot;noise margin.&quot; Students must first discover that there is a difference between voltage compliance levels for gate inputs versus outputs, then recognize that the difference constitutes a &quot;margin&quot; that imposed AC voltage (&quot;noise&quot;) must not exceed. They must then present their answer in terms of manufacturer specifications, obtained in datasheets. In summary, there is a lot of research that must occur to answer this question, but the results will be worth it!</p>
