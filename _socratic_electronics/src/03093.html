<p>Suppose you were given the following two equations and asked to find solutions for <span class="math"><em>x</em></span> and <span class="math"><em>y</em></span> that will satisfy <em>both</em> at the same time:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math"><em>y</em> + <em>x</em> = 8</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math"><em>y</em> − <em>x</em> = 3</span><br /></p>
<p>Now, you know that we may do anything we want to either equation as long as we do the same thing to both sides (on either side of the &quot;equal&quot; sign). This is the basic rule we follow when manipulating an equation to solve for a particular variable. For example, we may take the equation <span class="math"><em>y</em> + <em>x</em> = 8</span> and subtract <span class="math"><em>x</em></span> from both sides to yield an equation expressed in terms of <span class="math"><em>y</em></span>:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03093x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Following the same principle, we may take two equations and combine them either by adding or subtracting both sides. For example, we may take the equation <span class="math"><em>y</em> − <em>x</em> = 3</span> and add both sides of it to the respective sides of the first equation <span class="math"><em>y</em> + <em>x</em> = 8</span>:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03093x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>What beneficial result comes of this action? In other words, how can I use this new equation <span class="math">2<em>y</em> = 11</span> to solve for values of <span class="math"><em>x</em></span> and <span class="math"><em>y</em></span> that satisfy both of the original equations?</p>
<p>We may use the result (<span class="math">2<em>y</em> = 11</span>) to solve for a value of <span class="math"><em>y</em></span>, which when substituted into either of the original equations may be used to solve for a value of <span class="math"><em>x</em></span> to satisfy <em>both</em> equations at the same time.</p>
<p>While not intuitively obvious to most people, the technique of adding two entire equations to each other for the purpose of eliminating a variable is not only possible to do, but very powerful when looking for solutions to satisfy both original equations. Discuss with your students why it is allowable for us to add <span class="math"><em>y</em> − <em>x</em></span> to <span class="math"><em>y</em> + <em>x</em></span> and to add <span class="math">3</span> to <span class="math">8</span>. to yield the equation <span class="math">2<em>y</em> = 11</span>.</p>
