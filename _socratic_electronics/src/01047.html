<p>The &quot;Mesh Current&quot; method of network analysis works well to calculate currents in unbalanced bridge circuits. Take this circuit, for example:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01047x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Write three mesh equations for this circuit, following these three mesh currents:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01047x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Three mesh equations:</p>
<p><span class="math">170<em>I</em><sub>1</sub> + 50<em>I</em><sub>2</sub> − 120<em>I</em><sub>3</sub> = 10</span></p>
<p><span class="math">50<em>I</em><sub>1</sub> + 300<em>I</em><sub>2</sub> + 100<em>I</em><sub>3</sub> = 0</span></p>
<p><span class="math"> − 120<em>I</em><sub>1</sub> + 100<em>I</em><sub>2</sub> + 420<em>I</em><sub>3</sub> = 0</span></p>
<p>Students’ equations may not look exactly like these, depending on how they &quot;stepped&quot; around the loops tallying voltage drops. So long as they are all able to reach the same answers for <span class="math"><em>I</em><sub>1</sub></span>, <span class="math"><em>I</em><sub>2</sub></span>, and <span class="math"><em>I</em><sub>3</sub></span>, it does not matter. In fact, it is a good thing to have different students propose different forms of the equations to demonstrate that the same answers are obtained every time.</p>
<p>Of special importance in this problem is how students represent two meshing currents at a single resistor in their equations. A common mistake for beginning mesh current analysts is to disregard the relative directions of meshing currents. It makes a huge difference whether two mesh currents go the same direction through a resistor, or whether they go in opposite directions!</p>
