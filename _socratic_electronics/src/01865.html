<p>Determine the total impedance of this series-parallel network by first converting it into an equivalent network that is either all-series or all-parallel:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01865x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Equivalent parallel resistance and reactances:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01865x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math">$Z_{total} = 4.433 \hbox{ k}\Omega$</span></p>
<p>Although there are other methods of solving for total impedance in a circuit such as this, I want students to become comfortable with series/parallel equivalents as an analysis tool.</p>
