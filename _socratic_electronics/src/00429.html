<p>What resistor values would we have to choose in a Delta configuration to behave exactly the same as this Y-connected resistor network?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00429x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Each resistor in a Delta-connected network must have a value of 900 <span class="math">Ω </span>, to be equivalent to a Y-connected network of 300 <span class="math">Ω </span> resistors.</p>
<p>There exist long, complicated equations for converting between Y and Delta resistor networks, but there is a much simpler solution to this problem than that! Challenge your students to solve this problem without resorting to the use of one of those long conversion formulae.</p>
