<p>The amount of inductance inherent in a wire coil may be calculated by the following equation:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$L = {{N^2 A \mu} \over l}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Where,</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>L</em> = </span> Inductance in Henrys</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>N</em> = </span> Number of wire &quot;turns&quot; wrapped around the core</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>μ</em> = </span> Permeability of core material (absolute, not relative)</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>A</em> = </span> Core area, in square meters</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>l</em> = </span> Length of core, in meters</p>
<p>Calculate how many turns of wire must be wrapped around a hollow, non-magnetic (air) core 2 cm in diameter and 10 cm in length in order to create an inductance of 22 mH. You may use the permeability of free space (<span class="math"><em>μ</em><sub>0</sub></span>) for the <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span> value of the air core.</p>
<p>Next, calculate the required number of turns to produce the same inductance with a solid iron core of the same dimensions, assuming that the iron has a relative permeability (<span class="math"><em>μ</em><sub><em>r</em></sub></span>) of 4000.</p>
<p>Finally, knowing that the formula for the area of a circle is <span class="math"><em>π</em><em>r</em><sup>2</sup></span>, re-write the inductance equation so as to accept a value for inductor radius rather than inductor area. In other words, <em>substitute</em> radius (<span class="math"><em>r</em></span>) for area (<span class="math"><em>A</em></span>) in this equation in such a way that it still provides an accurate figure for inductance.</p>
<p>Approximately 2360 turns of wire for the air core, and approximately 37 turns of wire for the iron core.</p>
<p>New inductance equation:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$L = {{\pi N^2 r^2 \mu} \over l}$</span><br /></p>
<p>This problem is first and foremost an algebraic manipulation exercise: solving for <span class="math"><em>N</em></span> given the values of the other variables. Students should be able to research the value of <span class="math"><em>μ</em><sub>0</sub></span> quite easily, being a well-defined physical constant.</p>
<p>Note that in this equation, the Greek letter &quot;mu&quot; (<span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>) is not a metric prefix, but rather an actual variable! This confuses many students, who are used to interpreting <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span> as the metric prefix &quot;micro&quot; (<span class="math">${1 \over 1,000,000}$</span>).</p>
<p>Note also how the re-written equation puts pi (<span class="math"><em>π</em></span>) ahead of all the variables in the numerator of the fraction. This is not absolutely necessary, but it is conventional to write constants before variables. Do not be surprised if some students ask about this, as their answers probably looked like this:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$L = {{N^2 \pi r^2 \mu} \over l}$</span><br /></p>
