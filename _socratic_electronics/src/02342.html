<p>Determine whether the load is energized or de-energized with the switch in the position shown. Also, identify whether the transistor is a <em>depletion</em> type or an <em>enhancement</em> type:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02342x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The load will be <em>de-energized</em> as a result of this <em>enhancement-type</em> transistor being in the &quot;off&quot; state.</p>
<p>Ask your students to explain how they figured out the state of the transistor in this circuit, and also what function the double-pole, double-throw (DPDT) switch performs. Incidentally, this DPDT switch wiring configuration is quite common in electrical and electronic circuits!</p>
