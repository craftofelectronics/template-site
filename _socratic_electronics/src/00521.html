<p>An oft-repeated claim is that lead-acid batteries self-discharge at a greater rate while sitting on a concrete floor, than when installed in an automobile, or on a shelf, or in some other place where there is no direct contact with a concrete surface. Is this claim true, or not?</p>
<p>Design an experiment to test the veracity of this claim, and design it in such a way that a single instance of a defective battery does not skew the results of the test.</p>
<p>This is a fun topic to discuss! Do your research, and come to discussion time prepared with ideas on how to test this claim.</p>
<p>I have heard this claim many, many times, but I have not yet been in such a position where I could test it myself. Even if I had tested it, I still wouldnâ€™t give away the answer! There are many practical matters that must be addressed in the setup and testing of batteries for self-discharge. This question provides an excellent opportunity to discuss scientific method with your students, including such principles as <em>double-blind</em> testing, <em>test</em> and <em>control</em> groups, and statistical correlation.</p>
