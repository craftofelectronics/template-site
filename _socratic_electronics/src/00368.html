<p>We know that the voltage in a parallel circuit may be calculated with this formula:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math"><em>E</em> = <em>I</em><sub><em>t</em><em>o</em><em>t</em><em>a</em><em>l</em></sub><em>R</em><sub><em>t</em><em>o</em><em>t</em><em>a</em><em>l</em></sub></span><br /></p>
<p>We also know that the current through any single resistor in a parallel circuit may be calculated with this formula:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$I_R = {E \over R}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Combine these two formulae into one, in such a way that the <span class="math"><em>E</em></span> variable is eliminated, leaving only <span class="math"><em>I</em><sub><em>R</em></sub></span> expressed in terms of <span class="math"><em>I</em><sub><em>t</em><em>o</em><em>t</em><em>a</em><em>l</em></sub></span>, <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>t</em><em>o</em><em>t</em><em>a</em><em>l</em></sub></span>, and <span class="math"><em>R</em></span>.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$I_R = I_{total} \Bigl({R_{total} \over R}\Bigr)$</span><br /></p>
<p>How is this formula similar, and how is it different, from the &quot;voltage divider&quot; formula?</p>
<p>Though this &quot;current divider formula&quot; may be found in any number of electronics reference books, your students need to understand how to algebraically manipulate the given formulae to arrive at this one.</p>
<p>At first it may seem as though the two divider formulae (voltage versus current) are easy to confuse. Is it <span class="math">${R \over R_{total}}$</span> or <span class="math">${R_{total} \over R}$</span>? However, there is a very simple way to remember which fraction belongs with which formula, based on the numerical value of that fraction. Mention this to your students and at least one of them will be sure to recognize the pattern.</p>
