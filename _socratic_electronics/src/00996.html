<p>Junction field-effect transistors have the ability to perform some functions that are impossible with (single) bipolar junction transistors. Take this circuit, for example:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00996x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>What effect will opening and closing the toggle switch have on the AC signal measured at the output terminals?</p>
<p>When the toggle switch is open, the output signal will fall to (nearly) 0 volts AC. When the toggle switch is closed, the output signal will be (nearly) the same as <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>i</em><em>n</em></sub></span>.</p>
<p>Discuss how the JFET is able to perform this AC signal &quot;shunting&quot; function, whereas a BJT would not be able to do the same. Can your students think of any practical applications of a circuit like this?</p>
