<p>Shown here is the time-current curve for a <em>dual-element</em> fuse. <em>Thermal-magnetic</em> circuit breakers exhibit similar time-current curves:</p>

<p>Based on this curve, what do you think the purpose of a &quot;dual-element&quot; fuse or &quot;thermal-magnetic&quot; circuit breaker is? Why would this style of overcurrent protection device be chosen over a &quot;normal&quot; fuse or circuit breaker?</p>
<p>Such overcurrent protection devices combine the properties of &quot;time-overcurrent&quot; and &quot;instantaneous overcurrent&quot; protection in a single device, for protection against different types of damage resulting from different types of overcurrent conditions.</p>
<p>Obviously, not all overcurrent conditions are the same. Ask your students to describe circuit faults that would cause slight overcurrent, versus faults that would cause extreme overcurrent in a circuit, and discuss the destructive consequences of each type of condition.</p>
