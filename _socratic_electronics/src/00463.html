<p>Write the equation describing the voltage induced in this coil, solving for (instantaneous) induced voltage (<span class="math"><em>e</em></span>) in terms of the instantaneous magnetic flux (<span class="math"><em>Ï•</em></span>) and the number of turns of wire in the coil:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00463x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math">$e = N{d\phi \over dt}$</span></p>
<p>Follow-up question: algebraically manipulate this equation to solve for the number of turns (<span class="math"><em>N</em></span>) given all the other quantities.</p>
<p>It should be noted that in this particular case, <span class="math"><em>N</em></span> is equal to three (counting the turns in the illustrated coil).</p>
