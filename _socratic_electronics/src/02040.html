<p>From an examination of the energy diagram for a BJT in its conducting mode (current existing through each of the three terminals: emitter, base, and collector), determine the biasing of the two PN junctions:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> The emitter-base junction (<em>forward</em> or <em>reverse</em> biased?)</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> The base-collector junction (<em>forward</em> or <em>reverse</em> biased?)</p>
<p>One of these two junctions actually operates in the reverse-bias mode while the transistor is conducting. Explain how this is possible, as a simple PN junction (a diode) operating in reverse-bias mode conducts negligible current.</p>
<p>The emitter-base junction is forward-biased, while the base-collector junction is reverse-biased. Collector current is made possible across the base-collector junction by the presence of <em>injected charge carriers</em> from the emitter.</p>
<p>This question is possible to answer only if one understands the energy levels inside a BJT. The most common explanations of BJT function I find in introductory (non-engineering) textbooks completely omit discussions of energy levels, making the subject very confusing to new students.</p>
