<p>Describe how proper biasing is accomplished in this headphone amplifier circuit (suitable for amplifying the audio output of a small radio):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00750x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Also, describe the functions of the 10 k<span class="math">Ω </span> potentiometer and the 22 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>F capacitor.</p>
<p>Biasing is accomplished through the 100 k<span class="math">Ω </span> resistor. The 10 k<span class="math">Ω </span> potentiometer is the volume control, and the 22 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>F capacitor serves to &quot;couple&quot; the input signal to the transistor’s base, while blocking any DC bias voltage from being &quot;fed back&quot; to the audio signal source.</p>
<p>Challenge question: there is a name used to describe the dual-transistor configuration used in this circuit, where a pair of PNP or NPN transistors is cascaded, with the emitter of one going to the base of the other. What is this name, and what advantage does this configuration provide over a single transistor?</p>
<p>This circuit is simple enough to assemble and test in an hour or two, on a solderless breadboard. It would make a great lab experiment, and can be used by the students outside of class!</p>
