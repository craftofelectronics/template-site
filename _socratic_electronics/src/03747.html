<p>What causes harmonics to form in the output of a transistor oscillator circuit such as a Colpitts or a Hartley, which is designed to produce a sinusoidal signal? Be as specific as you can in your answer.</p>
<p>Any feature (or fault) of the amplifier portion of the oscillator circuit causing imperfect signal reproduction will necessarily create harmonics, for it will turn a perfectly sinusoidal input signal (from the LC network) into a distorted (non-perfect-sinusoidal) output signal.</p>
<p>Challenge question: Colpitts oscillators tend to produce &quot;purer&quot; sine-wave outputs than Hartley oscillators, all other factors being equal. Explain why.</p>
<p>Discuss with your students the nature of harmonics: how <em>multiple</em> sinusoidal waveforms are necessarily contained in any periodic waveform that is not perfectly sinusoidal itself.</p>
