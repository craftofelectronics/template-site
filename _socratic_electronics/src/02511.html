<p>Calculate the current through resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span> in this opamp circuit for several different values of <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span>:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02511x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math"></span><span class="math"></span> For each value of <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span>, what is it that establishes the amount of current through it? Do you see any practical value for a circuit such as this?</p>
<p><span class="math"></span><span class="math"></span> This circuit acts like a <em>current mirror</em>, except much more precise.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: what factor(s) limit the greatest resistance value of <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span> that the operational amplifier may sustain 3 milliamps of current through?</p>
<p>Besides reviewing the purpose of a current mirror circuit, this question draws studentsâ€™ attention to the current-regulating capabilities of an operational amplifier by having them analyze it as though it were simply a noninverting voltage amplifier circuit.</p>
