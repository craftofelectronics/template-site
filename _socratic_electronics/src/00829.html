<p>In this cascaded voltage divider circuit, determine the overall voltage gain ratio (from first input to last output), and also calculate the overall voltage gain in <em>decibels</em>, as well as the decibel figure for each dividerâ€™s voltage gain:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00829x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>What do you notice about the ratio figures versus the decibel figures, regarding how the individual stage gains compare with the overall gain?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00829x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Discuss with your students the nature of cascaded gain figures in both ratio and decibel formats. Which format is easier to calculate manually (without using a calculator)? Why is this?</p>
