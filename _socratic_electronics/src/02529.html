<p>The vast majority of audio power amplifier circuits are of the class-B, or <em>push-pull</em> design rather than class-A. Explain why.</p>
<p>Push-pull (class-B) amplifiers operate at much greater energy efficiency than class-A amplifier circuits. For audio power applications, class-A is generally considered too wasteful to be practical.</p>
