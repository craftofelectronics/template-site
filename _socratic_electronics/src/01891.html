<p>An <em>octave</em> is a type of harmonic frequency. Suppose an electronic circuit operates at a fundamental frequency of 1 kHz. Calculate the frequencies of the following octaves:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> 1 octave greater than the fundamental =</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> 2 octaves greater than the fundamental =</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> 3 octaves greater than the fundamental =</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> 4 octaves greater than the fundamental =</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> 5 octaves greater than the fundamental =</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> 6 octaves greater than the fundamental =</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> 1 octave greater than the fundamental = 2 kHz</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> 2 octaves greater than the fundamental = 4 kHz</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> 3 octaves greater than the fundamental = 8 kHz</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> 4 octaves greater than the fundamental = 16 kHz</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> 5 octaves greater than the fundamental = 32 kHz</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> 6 octaves greater than the fundamental = 64 kHz</p>
<p>Ask your students if they can determine the mathematical relationship between octave number, octave frequency, and fundamental frequency. This is a bit more difficult to do than for integer harmonics, but not beyond reason if students are familiar with exponents.</p>
<p>Clarify for your students the fact that &quot;octave&quot; is not just a musical term. In electronic circuit analysis (especially filter circuits), the word &quot;octave&quot; is often used to represent multiples of a given frequency, usually in reference to a bandwidth (i.e. &quot;This filter’s passband response is essentially flat over two octaves!&quot;).</p>
