<p><em>Stepper motors</em> are often used in low-power servomechanisms such as those found in small robots, computer printers, and other precision electro-mechanical machines. Explain why this type of electric motor is more popular than permanent-magnet DC motors or other motor types. Hint: the answer is closely related to the name of the motor itself (&quot;stepper&quot;).</p>
<p>Unlike other motor types, <em>stepper</em> motors move in discrete &quot;steps,&quot; lending themselves very well to digital modes of position control.</p>
<p>Make sure students get a chance to feel the motion of a stepper motor in their own hands when you discuss stepper motors in class. If you donâ€™t happen to have any stepper motors available, they are easily obtained by salvaging parts from worn-out computer printers!</p>
