<p>Determine the voltage output by the following R-2R ladder network given the switch states shown in the table:</p>

<p><span class="math"></span><br /><span class="math">$\underbar{file 04007}$</span><br /><span class="math"></span></p>
<p>Follow-up question: the fact that an R-2R resistor network is inherently linear, we may readily apply the <em>Superposition Theorem</em> to figure out what happens when more than one switch is moved to the <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>r</em><em>e</em><em>f</em></sub></span> position. Explain how you would apply Superposition to determine all output voltages for all possible combinations of switch positions.</p>
<p>As you can see, the reference voltage value of 16 volts was not chosen at random! I wanted students to see the pattern between single switch closures and binary place-weights for a four-bit number. The actual electrical analyses for each condition are best expedited by applying Thévenin’s theorem repeated to the circuit, condensing sections to single resistances and voltage sources until a simple voltage divider circuit is obtained at the output terminal.</p>
<p>The follow-up question is quite important. Be sure to ask your students about it, for it holds the key to figuring out all output voltage values for all binary input possibilities.</p>
