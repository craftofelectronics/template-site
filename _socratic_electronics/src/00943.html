<p>Though the characteristic curves for a transistor are usually generated in a circuit where base current is constant and the collector-emitter voltage (<span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>C</em><em>E</em></sub></span>) is varied, this is usually not how transistor amplifier circuits are constructed. Typically, the base current varies with the input signal, and the collector power supply is a fixed-voltage source:</p>

<p>The presence of a load resistor in the circuit adds another dynamic to the circuit’s behavior. Explain what happens to the transistor’s collector-emitter voltage (<span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>C</em><em>E</em></sub></span>) as the collector current increases (dropping more battery voltage across the load resistor), and qualitatively plot this <em>load line</em> on the same type of graph used for plotting transistor curves:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00943x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Because there are no numbers along the axes of this graph, the best you can do is plot the general slope of the line, from upper-left to lower-right:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00943x03.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Ask your student why this plot is straight, and not curved like the transistor’s characteristic function.</p>
