<p>What if this voltmeter suddenly stopped working when set in its middle range. The upper and lower ranges still function just fine, though. Identify the most likely source of the problem.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00724x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The middle contact in switch SW2 is open. This, despite being the most likely failure, is not the only possible failure that could cause this problem (middle range not functioning)!</p>
<p>Challenge question: explain how you could verify the nature of the fault without using another meter.</p>
<p>Brainstorm some other alternative possibilities for causing the problem, along with diagnostic procedures to verify each one of them (using another meter, if necessary). Then, discuss with your students the reason why a switch failure is more likely than any of the other faults.</p>
