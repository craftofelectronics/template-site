<p>Precision voltage reference regulators are often constructed of two zener diodes connected in series like this:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01062x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Explain why <em>two</em> zener diodes provide greater stability than a single zener diode would, and also draw a circuit showing a voltage source, so this component functions as a complete voltage reference.</p>
<p>Two zener diodes provide better stability than a single zener diode because the thermal coefficients of the diodes in their respective modes are complementary. This assumes, of course, that the reverse-biased diode uses the <em>avalanche effect</em> to regulate voltage.</p>
<p>A functioning voltage regulator circuit might look like this:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01062x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Some students may become confused by the word &quot;complementary&quot; as it is used in the answer. Ask all your students to explain what this word means, in the context of two temperature coefficients and increased stability.</p>
