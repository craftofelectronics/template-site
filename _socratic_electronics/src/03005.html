<p><em>Multiplexers</em> and <em>demultiplexers</em> are often confused with one another by students first learning about them. Although they appear similar, they certainly perform different functions. Shown here is a multiplexer and a demultiplexer, each using a multiple-position switch symbol to indicate the selection functions inside the respective circuits:</p>

<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03005x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>After identifying which is which, provide definitions for &quot;multiplexer&quot; and &quot;demultiplexer&quot; in your own words.</p>
<p>Iâ€™ll let you research the answer to this question on your own!</p>
<p>This question forces students to directly face a point of confusion I have noticed over several years of teaching. Ask them where they were able to find definitions for each term.</p>
