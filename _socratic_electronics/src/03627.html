<p>Calculate the total impedance of this series RLC circuit and express it in polar form (magnitude and phase angle):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03627x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math">${\bf Z_{total}}$</span> =</p>
<p><span class="math">${\bf Z_{total}}$</span> = 2.777 k<span class="math">Ω </span> <span class="math">∠</span> -13.52<span class="math">$^{o}$</span></p>
<p>I recommend assigning 4 points to the correct magnitude and 4 points to the correct angle.</p>
