<p>In a &quot;ladder logic&quot; diagram such as the one shown here, what do <span class="math"><em>L</em><sub>1</sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>L</em><sub>2</sub></span> represent?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02367x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>These points represent the poles of a power source for the circuit, usually 120 volts AC (with <span class="math"><em>L</em><sub>1</sub></span> being &quot;hot&quot; and <span class="math"><em>L</em><sub>2</sub></span> being &quot;neutral&quot;).</p>
