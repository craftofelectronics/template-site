<p>What will happen in each of these systems to the phase voltages of the load, if one of the source phases fails open?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00423x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>In the Y-Y system, with no neutral wire, one of the load phases will completely lose power, while the voltages of the other two load phases will be reduced to 86.7 % of normal.</p>
<p>In the Delta-Y system, none of the phase voltages will be affected by the failure of the source phase winding.</p>
<p>Ask your students what these results indicate about the reliability of Y versus Delta source configurations. Also, be sure to ask what <em>does</em> change in the Delta-Y system as a result of the failure. Certainly, <em>something</em> must be different from before, with one winding completely failed open!</p>
