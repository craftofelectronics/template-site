<p>Suppose I connect two resistors in series with one another, like this:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01721x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>How much electrical resistance would you expect an ohmmeter to indicate if it were connected across the combination of these two series-connected resistors?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01721x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Explain the reasoning behind your answer, and try to formulate a generalization for all combinations of series resistances.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01721x03.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Follow-up question: how much resistance would you expect the ohmmeter to register if there were <em>three</em> similarly-sized resistors connected in series instead of two? What if there were <em>four</em> resistors?</p>
<p>The concept of series (total) resistance, in relation to individual resistances, usually does not present any difficulties to new students. Parallel resistances are a bit trickier, though . . .</p>
