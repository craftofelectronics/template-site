<p>Calculate the total voltage for these series-connected AC voltage sources, assuming they are both at the same frequency (<span class="math"><em>f</em></span>):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03567x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>You do not have to express an angle for the total voltage, only a magnitude (how many volts). Show your work, as well as a phasor diagram showing how the total voltage relates to the two source voltages.</p>
