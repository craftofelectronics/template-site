<p>What is <em>soldering</em>? What is <em>solder</em>?</p>
<p>&quot;Soldering&quot; is a low-temperature form of welding commonly used to join electrical conductors together for permanent connections.</p>
<p>&quot;Solder&quot; is a special alloy of metals designed to melt at a low temperature, to make permanent electrical connections.</p>
<p>It should be noted that not all forms of soldering are &quot;low temperature.&quot; Silver soldering, for example, takes place at much greater temperatures than regular electrical soldering. However, all soldering is a form of welding.</p>
