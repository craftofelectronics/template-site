<p>Most operational amplifiers do not have the ability to swing their output voltages rail-to-rail. Most of those do not swing their output voltages symmetrically. That is, a typical non-rail-to-rail opamp may be able to approach one power supply rail voltage closer than the other; e.g. when powered by a +15/-15 volt split supply, the output saturates positive at +14 volts and saturates negative at -13.5 volts.</p>
<p>What effect do you suppose this non-symmetrical output range will have on a typical relaxation oscillator circuit such as the following, and how might you suggest we fix the problem?</p>

<p>The duty cycle will not be 50%. One way to fix the problem is to do something like this:</p>

<p>Follow-up question: explain how and why <em>this</em> solution works. Now you just <em>knew</em> I was going to ask this question the moment you saw the diagram, didnâ€™t you?</p>
<p>Note that I added an additional resistor to the circuit, in series with the opamp output terminal. In some cases this is not necessary because the opamp is self-limiting in output current, but it is a good design practice nonetheless. In the event anyone ever swaps out the original opamp for a different model lacking overcurrent protection, the new opamp will not become damaged.</p>
