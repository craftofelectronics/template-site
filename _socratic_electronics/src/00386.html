<p>If an electric drill is plugged into a very long extension cord instead of being plugged directly into a power receptacle, what will happen to the drill’s performance? Explain your answer, with reference to Ohm’s Law.</p>
<p>The drill will not perform with as much power as it would if directly plugged into a power receptacle.</p>
<p>Challenge question: draw an equivalent schematic diagram showing the resistance of the extension cord conductors as resistors with the labels <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>w</em><em>i</em><em>r</em><em>e</em>1</sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>w</em><em>i</em><em>r</em><em>e</em>2</sub></span>.</p>
<p>Students who have worked with power tools, especially on construction sites where long extension cords are commonly used, will be familiar with this phenomenon. Ask your students what effect different gauges of wire in the extension cord would have on this degradation of drill motor performance. Also, ask about different lengths of extension cord. What, exactly, is the electrical quantity that varies with these dimensional changes, that causes the drill motor performance to vary?</p>
