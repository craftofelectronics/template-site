<p>Sum-of-Products (SOP) expressions may be implemented by a combination of AND and OR gates, as such:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02860x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Use DeMorgan’s Theorem to prove that this NAND gate circuit performs the exact same function:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02860x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>I’ll leave the proof up to you!</p>
<p>This is a very practical application of DeMorgan’s Theorem. Being able to use all NAND gates to implement an SOP function is a bonus over having to use separate AND and OR integrated circuit packages (one IC instead of two in this particular case).</p>
