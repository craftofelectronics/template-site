<p>Identify the primary-secondary connection configuration of these pole-mounted power transformers (i.e. Y-Y, Y-Delta, Delta-Y, etc.):</p>

<p>These transformers are connected in a Y-Delta configuration.</p>
<p>Being that pole-mounted power distribution transformers are exposed for anyone to look at, they provide an excellent opportunity for students to practice identifying three-phase connections. If there are any such transformer configurations located near your campus, it would be an interesting field exercise to bring students there (or send them there on &quot;field research&quot;!) to identify the connections. Photographs of transformer connections may also be used in the classroom to provide practical examples of this concept.</p>
