<p>A beginning electronics student is just learning about transistors, and reads in the textbook that a bipolar transistor (either NPN or PNP) can be thought of as two diodes connected back-to-back as such:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02033x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Acting on this idea, the student proceeds to connect two 1N4001 rectifying diodes back-to-back and try to use it as a transistor. This idea does not work: although the diode pair reads the same patterns of continuity as a transistor would, it does not amplify. Explain why.</p>
<p>Note: this is a fairly deep question, and may not be answered without an understanding of charge carrier energy levels and semiconductor junction behavior.</p>
<p>This makeshift transistor will not work because the metal connection between the two &quot;P&quot;-type materials (the diode anodes) precludes the injection of minority carrier (conduction band level) electrons into the &quot;P&quot; material of the collector-side diode.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: what do you suppose is <em>really</em> meant by the textbookâ€™s statement of bipolar transistors being equivalent to back-to-back diodes, if two diodes connected back-to-back do not exhibit amplifying behavior? Is this a completely wrong statement, or is there some truth to it?</p>
<p>The idea for this question came from personal experience. I actually tried to build my own transistor out of two back-to-back diodes, and failed miserably. It took <em>many</em> years before I finally understood enough about semiconductor physics to realize why it would not work!</p>
