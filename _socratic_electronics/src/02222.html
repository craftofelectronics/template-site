<p>If we were to apply a sinusoidal AC signal to the input of this transistor amplifier circuit, the output would definitely <em>not</em> be sinusoidal:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02222x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>It should be apparent that only portions of the input are being reproduced at the output of this circuit. The rest of the waveform seems to be &quot;missing,&quot; being replaced by a flat line. Explain why this transistor circuit is not able to amplify the <em>entire</em> waveform.</p>
<p>Transistors are essentially DC devices, not AC devices. Consider the base-emitter PN junction that the input signal is sent to: it can only conduct in one direction (base positive and emitter negative).</p>
<p>Sometimes it is helpful for students to re-draw the circuit using a transistor model showing the base-emitter junction as a diode. If you think this model would help some of your students understand the concept here, have another student draw the transistor model on the whiteboard, and use that drawing as a discussion aid. Like any PN junction, the base-emitter junction of a BJT only &quot;wants&quot; to conduct current in one direction.</p>
