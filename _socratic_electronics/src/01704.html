<p>Explain why birds do not get shocked when they perch on a power line, even if both of their feet touch the wire. Explain why birds become electrocuted if their wings bridge between two different power conductors:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01704x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>For a schematic view of both scenarios, see this diagram:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01704x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Perhaps the easiest way to explain the relative danger of these two scenarios is by way of voltage. The &quot;safe&quot; bird will not be shocked because there is negligible voltage between its feet (both feet resting on the same wire). Points connected directly together with low-resistance (conductive) wire are said to be <em>electrically common</em>, and should never have appreciable voltage between them.</p>
<p>The dead bird got that way because there is full source voltage between the two points of contact (each wing-tip touching a different wire).</p>
<p>Follow-up question: a safety device called a <em>Faraday cage</em> protects anyone inside from electrical shock. A Faraday cage is nothing more than a cage made of closely-spaced metal bars (or alternatively, made of metal wire mesh):</p>

<p>Explain how the principle of electrically common points protects the person inside the Faraday cage from being shocked by the outside source of high voltage. Discuss how this principle might apply to metal-frame automobiles and aircraft.</p>
<p>Very vivid demonstrations have been performed with Van de Graaff generators and Tesla coils showing the protective nature of a Faraday cage. When students understand that substantial voltage cannot exist between electrically common points (at least at frequencies below RF!), not only are they prepared to understand the purpose of safety grounding in electrical systems, but they are also equipped with an extremely important concept for use in electrical troubleshooting.</p>
