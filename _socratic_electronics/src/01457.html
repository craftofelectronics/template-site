<p>Many switched capacitor circuits require <em>non-overlapping</em>, two-phase clock signals. Shown here is a schematic diagram of a gate circuit that converts a single clock signal into two complementary, non-overlapping clock signals:</p>

<p>Assume that the only gates possessing propagation delays are the double-NOT gates (inside the dotted boxes), whose sole purpose it is to provide a short time delay in the feedback signals. Draw a timing diagram showing the two-phase clock signals (<span class="math"><em>ϕ</em><sub>1</sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>ϕ</em><sub>2</sub></span>) in relation to the input clock waveform, and be prepared to explain how and why this circuit works:</p>

<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01457x03.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Although it will be obvious to many of your students, you might want to ask “why do we call the two clock signals <em>non-overlapping</em>?” What, exactly, would an <em>overlapping</em> set of clock signals look like, in comparison?</p>
