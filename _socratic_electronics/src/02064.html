<p>A bipolar junction transistor parameter similar to <span class="math"><em>β</em></span> is &quot;alpha,&quot; symbolized by the Greek letter <span class="math"><em>α</em></span>. It is defined as the ratio between collector current and emitter current:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\alpha = {I_C \over I_E}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Apply algebraic substitution to this formula so that alpha is defined as a <em>function</em> of beta: <span class="math"><em>α</em> = <em>f</em>(<em>β</em>)</span>. In other words, substitute and manipulate this equation until you have alpha by itself on one side and no variable except beta on the other.</p>
<p>You may find the following equations helpful in your work:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\beta = {I_C \over I_B} \hbox{\hskip 50pt} I_E = I_C + I_B$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\alpha = {\beta \over {\beta + 1}}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Follow-up question: what range of values might you expect for <span class="math"><em>α</em></span>, with a typical transistor?</p>
<p>This question is nothing more than an exercise in algebraic manipulation.</p>
