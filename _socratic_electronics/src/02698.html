<p>How much current (<span class="math"><em>I</em></span>) would have to be forced through the resistor in order to generate an output voltage of 5 volts?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02698x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>At what <em>rate</em> would <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>i</em><em>n</em></sub></span> have to increase in order to cause this amount of current to go &quot;through&quot; the capacitor, and thereby cause 5 volts to appear at the <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>o</em><em>u</em><em>t</em></sub></span> terminal? What does this tell us about the behavior of this circuit?</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>I</em></span> = 2.273 mA <span class="math">$dV_{in} \over dt$</span> = 227.3 volts/second</p>
<p>The fact that this circuit outputs a voltage proportional to the <em>rate of change</em> over time of the input voltage indicates that it is a <em>differentiator</em>.</p>
<p>This question is a good review of capacitor theory (relating voltage and current with regard to a capacitor), as well as an introduction to how op-amp circuits can perform calculus functions.</p>
