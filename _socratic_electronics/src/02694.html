<p>How much current will go through the load in this op-amp circuit?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02694x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>What impact will a change in load resistance have on the operation of this circuit? What will change, if anything, supposing the load resistance were to increase?</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>I</em><sub><em>l</em><em>o</em><em>a</em><em>d</em></sub> = </span> 1.818 mA</p>
<p>If the load changes resistance, there will be no effect on the amount of current through it, although there will be an effect on the output <em>voltage</em> of the opamp!</p>
<p>The purpose of this question, besides giving students reason to review a constant-current opamp circuit, is to preview the behavior of an active integrator using the same resistor and input voltage values (question #01008).</p>
