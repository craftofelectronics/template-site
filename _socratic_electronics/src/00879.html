<p>Explain the operation of this sound-activated relay circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00879x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The relay will energize if a loud enough sound is detected by the microphone. The threshold volume is set by the potentiometer.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: how could we equip this circuit with the ability to turn the relay off once it has been turned on?</p>
<p>There is a lot going on in this circuit that is not addressed in the answer I give. The basic purpose of the circuit should be fairly clear to understand, but the function of several components deserve further explanation. Ask your students to explain the functions of the diode on the comparatorâ€™s output, the diode in parallel with the relay coil, the zener diode in parallel with the potentiometer, and the SCR.</p>
