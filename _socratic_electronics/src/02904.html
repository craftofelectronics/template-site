<p>Draw the paths of all currents in this circuit with the input in a &quot;low&quot; state:</p>

<p>Now, draw the paths of all currents in this circuit with the input in a &quot;high&quot; state:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02904x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Where is the power supplied for each LED? What relationship is there between the load current (LED) and the gate input current (through the SPDT switch)?</p>
<p>Also, explain how you would calculate the values for appropriate LED current-limiting resistors in this circuit.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02904x03.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02904x04.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>In each scenario, the LEDâ€™s power is supplied by <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>C</em><em>C</em></sub></span> and ground: the DC power source. Note that the input switch merely &quot;tells&quot; the output what to do rather than handle actual load current, just like the inputs of an operational amplifier or comparator.</p>
<p>The utility of conventional flow notation (as opposed to electron flow) becomes especially apparent in this answer, as the upper circuit is the one <em>sourcing</em> current and the lower circuit is the one <em>sinking</em> current.</p>
<p>As with operational amplifiers, I find it necessary to point out to some students that the inputs of a logic gate circuit do not sink or source load current. This fact underscores the need to supply DC power to the logic gate for proper operation.</p>
