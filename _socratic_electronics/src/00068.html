<p>One of the more difficult skills for students to develop is the ability to translate the layout of a real-world circuit into a neat schematic diagram. Developing this skill requires lots of practice.</p>
<p>It is very worthwhile for students to discuss how they solve problems such as these with each other. For those students who have trouble visualizing shapes, a simple hint or &quot;trick&quot; to use when translating schematics to illustrations or visa-versa may be invaluable.</p>
