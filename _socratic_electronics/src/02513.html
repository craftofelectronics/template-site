<p>Explain how the operational amplifier maintains a constant current through the load:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02513x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Write an equation solving for the regulated load current, given any relevant variables shown in the schematic diagram (<span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span>, <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>Z</em></sub></span>, <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>s</em><em>u</em><em>p</em><em>p</em><em>l</em><em>y</em></sub></span>, <span class="math"><em>A</em><sub><em>V</em>(<em>O</em><em>L</em>)</sub></span>, etc.). Also, describe what would have to be changed in this circuit in order to set the regulated current at a different value.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$I_{load} = {V_Z \over R_1}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Follow-up question: is the transistor <em>sourcing</em> current to the load, or <em>sinking</em> current from it?</p>
<p>Challenge question #1: modify the given equation to more precisely predict load current, taking the <span class="math"><em>β</em></span> of the transistor into account.</p>
<p>Challenge question #2: modify the location of the load in this circuit so that the given equation does precisely predict load current, rather than closely approximate load current.</p>
<p>This is a good example of how operational amplifiers may greatly improve the functions of discrete-component circuits. In this case, the opamp performs the function of a <em>current mirror</em> circuit, and does so with greater precision and reliability than a simple current mirror ever could.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the equation provided in the answer does not directly predict the current through the load, rather it predicts current through resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span>. This is equal to load current only if the transistor’s base current is zero, which of course it cannot be. The <em>real</em> equation for predicting load current will be a bit more complex than what is given in the answer, and I leave it for your students to derive.</p>
