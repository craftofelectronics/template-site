<p>What does it mean if a meter movement is described as being <em>RMS indicating, average responding</em>?</p>
<p>It means that the meter movement’s indication is naturally proportional to the <em>average</em> value of the measured AC signal, but its calibration is skewed to represent RMS value when measuring a sinusoidal signal.</p>
<p>Challenge question: if one of these meters is subjected to a square-wave AC signal, will its &quot;RMS&quot; indication be falsely low, falsely high, or accurate?</p>
<p>This concept is confusing to many students, yet important for them to understand. I suggest you illuminate the subject by asking a series of questions:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> What would one of these meters indicate if the amplitude of a sinusoidal signal were doubled? <em>Answer: the indication would double.</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> What would one of these meters indicate if the signal amplitude and wave-shape were to change in such a way that the average value of the signal doubled, but the RMS value did not increase as much? <em>Answer: the indication would double.</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> What would one of these meters indicate if the signal amplitude and wave-shape were to change in such a way that the RMS value of the signal doubled, but the average value did not increase as much? <em>Answer: the indication would increase only as much as the average value increased.</em></p>
