<p>Calculate the voltage gain of the following opamp circuit with the potentiometer turned fully up, precisely mid-position, and fully down:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03002x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math"><em>A</em><sub><em>V</em></sub></span> (pot fully up) =</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math"><em>A</em><sub><em>V</em></sub></span> (pot mid-position) =</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math"><em>A</em><sub><em>V</em></sub></span> (pot fully down) =</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math"><em>A</em><sub><em>V</em></sub></span> (pot fully up) = +1</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math"><em>A</em><sub><em>V</em></sub></span> (pot mid-position) = 0</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math"><em>A</em><sub><em>V</em></sub></span> (pot fully down) = -1</p>
<p>Follow-up question: can you think of any interesting applications for a circuit such as this?</p>
<p>Challenge question: modify the circuit so that the range of voltage gain adjustment is -6 to +6 instead of -1 to +1.</p>
<p>Ask your students how they approached this problem. How, exactly, did they choose to set it up so the solution became most apparent?</p>
