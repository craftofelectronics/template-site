<p>Explain why the &quot;impedance triangle&quot; is <em>not</em> proper to use for relating total impedance, resistance, and reactance in parallel circuits as it is for series circuits:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02078x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Impedances do not add in parallel.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: what kind of a triangle <em>could</em> be properly applied to a parallel AC circuit, and why?</p>
<p>Trying to apply the <span class="math"><em>Z</em></span>-<span class="math"><em>R</em></span>-<span class="math"><em>X</em></span> triangle directly to parallel AC circuits is a common mistake many new students make. Key to knowing when and how to use triangles to graphically depict AC quantities is understanding <em>why</em> the triangle works as an analysis tool and <em>what</em> its sides represent.</p>
