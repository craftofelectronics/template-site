<p>The energy efficiency (<span class="math"><em>η</em></span>) of switching converter circuits typically remains fairly constant over a wide range of voltage conversion ratios. Describe how a switching <em>regulator</em> circuit (controlling load voltage to a pre-set value) &quot;appears&quot; to a power source of changing voltage if the regulator’s load is constant. In other words, as the input voltage changes, what does the input current do?</p>
<p>The input current of a switching regulator is <em>inversely</em> proportional to the input voltage when powering a constant load, appearing as a <em>negative impedance</em> to the power source.</p>
<p>&quot;Negative impedance&quot; and &quot;negative resistance&quot; are phrases that may not be addressed very often in a basic electronics curriculum, but they have important consequences. If students experience difficulty understanding what the meaning of &quot;negative&quot; impedance is, remind them of this mathematical definition for impedance:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$Z = {dV \over dI}$</span><br /></p>
<p>One of the unintended (and counter-intuitive) consequences of a circuit element with negative impedance can be <em>oscillation</em>, especially when the input power circuit happens to contain substantial inductance.</p>
