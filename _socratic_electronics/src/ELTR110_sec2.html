<p>A powerful tool used for understanding the operation of AC circuits is the <em>phasor diagram</em>, consisting of arrows pointing in different directions: the length of each arrow representing the amplitude of some AC quantity (voltage, current, or impedance), and the angle of each arrow representing the shift in phase relative to the other arrows. By representing each AC quantity thusly, we may more easily calculate their relationships to one another, with the phasors showing us how to apply trigonometry (Pythagorean Theorem, sine, cosine, and tangent functions) to the various calculations. An analytical parallel to the graphic tool of phasor diagrams is <em>complex numbers</em>, where we represent each phasor (arrow) by a pair of numbers: either a magnitude and angle (polar notation), or by &quot;real&quot; and &quot;imaginary&quot; magnitudes (rectangular notation). Where phasor diagrams are helpful is in applications where their respective AC quantities <em>add</em>: the resultant of two or more phasors stacked tip-to-tail being the mathematical sum of the phasors. Complex numbers, on the other hand, may be added, subtracted, multiplied, and divided; the last two operations being difficult to graphically represent with arrows.</p>
<p>Conductance, symbolized by the letter <span class="math"><em>G</em></span>, is the mathematical reciprocal of resistance (<span class="math">$1 \over R$</span>). Students typically encounter this quantity in their DC studies and quickly ignore it. In AC calculations, however, conductance and its AC counterparts (<em>susceptance</em>, the reciprocal of reactance <span class="math">$B = {1 \over X}$</span> and <em>admittance</em>, the reciprocal of impedance <span class="math">$Y = {1 \over Z}$</span>) are very necessary in order to draw phasor diagrams for parallel networks.</p>
<p>When students first encounter capacitance, they are struck by how this quantity adds when capacitors are connected in <em>parallel</em>, not in series as it is for resistors and inductors. They are surprised again, though, when they discover that the opposition to current offered by capacitors (either as scalar reactance or phasor impedance) adds in series just as resistance adds in series and inductive reactance/impedance adds in series. Remember: <em>ohms</em> always add in series, no matter what their source(s); only <em>farads</em> add in parallel (omitting <em>siemens</em> or <em>mhos</em>, the units for conductance and admittance and susceptance, which of course also add in parallel).</p>
<p>Many students have a predisposition to memorization (as opposed to comprehension of concepts), and so when approaching filter circuits they try to identify the various types by memorizing the positions of reactive components. As I like to tell my students, <em>memory will fail you</em>, and so a better approach is to develop analytical techniques by which you may determine circuit function based on &quot;first principles&quot; of circuits. The approach I recommend begins by identifying component impedance (open or short) for very low and very high frequencies, respectively, then qualitatively analyzing voltage drops under those extreme conditions. If a filter circuit outputs a strong voltage at low frequencies and a weak voltage at high frequencies then it must be a low-pass filter. If it outputs a weak voltage at both low and high frequencies then it must be a band-pass filter, etc.</p>
<p>Bode plots show how filter circuits respond to inputs of changing frequency, but this is not how filters are typically used in real applications. Rarely does one find a filter circuit subjected to one particular frequency at a time – usually a simultaneous mix of frequencies are seen at the input, and it is the filter’s job to select a particular range of frequencies to pass through from that simultaneous mix. Understanding the superposition theorem precedes an understanding of how filter circuits are practically used.</p>
