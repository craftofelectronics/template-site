<p>An obsolete display technology that still finds enthusiastic followers in the hobbyist world, called <em>Nixie tubes</em>, relies on a BCD-to-10 decoder to drive one of ten different metal cathodes inside a neon-filled glass bulb. For each BCD code, exactly one of the cathode figures inside the &quot;Nixie tube&quot; will glow, causing that numeral to shine with a pink-orange light. The tube receives power through a common anode (usually over 150 volts DC).</p>
<p>A friend of yours is trying to build his own Nixie tube display circuit, but is experiencing problems. He wants to use a 7442 BCD-to-10 decoder to drive ten discrete transistors, each one handling the current for a digit in the tube. Being cautious, your friend decides to connect just one of the Nixie tube digits to a transistor, and then to the 7442, to see if the idea works (before connecting all ten).</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03917x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Unfortunately, that one digit begins to glow the moment the high-voltage DC supply is turned on, even before the 7442 chip receives power! And after that, the 7442 gets warm to the touch, which is not good.</p>
<p>Thinking he has damaged the 7442 IC, your friend turns to you for advice. Did he do anything wrong here? Explain what advice you would give to him.</p>
<p>The transistor is not correct. Your friend will have to have a different transistor output stage for his display circuit!</p>
<p>Follow-up question: comment on your friends’ strategy to connect only one transistor to one Nixie tube cathode for a test. Was this a good idea? Why or why not? Did doing this save the 7442 from further damage?</p>
<p>I have left the answer purposefully vague so that students will have to figure out how to properly use BJTs to drive the Nixie tube cathodes. This is a good opportunity for them to review BJT theory and switch application use, so don’t spoil it by giving away the answer!</p>
