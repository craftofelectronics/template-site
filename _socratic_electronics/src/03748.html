<p>A student is asked to calculate the phase shift for the following circuit’s output voltage, relative to the phase of the source voltage:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03748x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>He recognizes this as a series circuit, and therefore realizes that a right triangle would be appropriate for representing component impedances and component voltage drops (because both impedance and voltage are quantities that add in series, and the triangle represents phasor addition):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03748x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The problem now is, which angle does the student solve for in order to find the phase shift of <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>o</em><em>u</em><em>t</em></sub></span>? The triangle contains two angles besides the 90<span class="math">$^{o}$</span> angle, <span class="math">Θ </span> and <span class="math">Φ </span>. Which one represents the output phase shift, and more importantly, <em>why</em>?</p>
<p>The proper angle in this circuit is <span class="math">Θ </span>, and it will be a positive (leading) quantity.</p>
<p>Too many students blindly use impedance and voltage triangles without really understand what they are and why they work. These same students will have no idea how to approach a problem like this. Work with them to help them understand!</p>
