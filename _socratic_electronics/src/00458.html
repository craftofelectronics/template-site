<p>Calculate the voltage across the switch contacts the exact moment they open, and 15 milliseconds after they have been opened:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00458x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math"><em>E</em><sub><em>s</em><em>w</em><em>i</em><em>t</em><em>c</em><em>h</em></sub> = </span> 40.91 V @ <span class="math"><em>t</em> = </span> 0 seconds</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>E</em><sub><em>s</em><em>w</em><em>i</em><em>t</em><em>c</em><em>h</em></sub> = </span> 9.531 V @ <span class="math"><em>t</em> = </span> 15 milliseconds</p>
<p>Follow-up question: predict all voltage drops in this circuit in the event that the inductor fails open (broken wire inside).</p>
<p>There is quite a lot to calculate in order to reach the solutions in this question. There is more than one valid way to approach it, as well. An important fact to note: the voltage across the switch contacts, in both examples, is greater than the battery voltage! Just as capacitive time-constant circuits can generate currents in excess of what their power sources can supply, inductive time-constant circuits can generate voltages in excess of what their power sources can supply.</p>
<p>The follow-up question is simply an exercise in troubleshooting theory.</p>
