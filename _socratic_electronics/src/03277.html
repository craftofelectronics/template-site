<p>How much inductance would an inductor have to possess in order to provide 540 <span class="math">Ω </span> of reactance at a frequency of 400 Hz? Write the formula for solving this, in addition to calculating the frequency.</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>L</em> = </span> 214.9 mH</p>
<p>Be sure to ask your students to demonstrate the algebraic manipulation of the original formula, in providing the answer to this question. Algebraic manipulation of equations is a very important skill to have, and it comes only by study and practice.</p>
