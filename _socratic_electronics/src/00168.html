<p>What disadvantages might there be to using undersized wire in an electrical power distribution system, where electricity is transmitted from generators (sources) to &quot;loads&quot; (devices requiring power) far away? What might happen if the wires we choose for this application were to have insufficient cross-sectional area?</p>
<p>An analogy: what would happen if the water pipes in a municipal water supply system were sized too small?</p>
<p>The effects of undersized wiring are multiple: not only is there inefficiency in the system when conductors are too small, but there are safety hazards as well!</p>
