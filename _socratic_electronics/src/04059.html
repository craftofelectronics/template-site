<p>If you have studied complex numbers, you know that the same complex quantity may be written in two different forms: <em>rectangular</em> and <em>polar</em>. Take for example the complex quantity <span class="math">${\sqrt{3} \over 2} + j{1 \over 2}$</span>. The following illustration shows this point located on the complex plane, along with its rectangular dimensions:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{04059x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Next, we see the same point, on the same complex plane, along with its polar coordinates:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{04059x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Written out, we might express the equivalence of these two notations as such:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">${\sqrt{3} \over 2} + j{1 \over 2} = 1 \angle {\pi \over 6}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Expressed in a more general form, the equivalence between rectangular and polar notations would look like this:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math"><em>a</em> + <em>j</em><em>b</em> = <em>c</em>∠Θ </span><br /></p>
<p>However, a problem with the &quot;angle&quot; symbol (<span class="math">∠</span>) is that we have no standardized way to deal with it mathematically. We would have to invent special rules to describe how to add, subtract, multiply, divide, differentiate, integrate, or otherwise manipulate complex quantities expressed using this symbol. A more profitable alternative to using the &quot;angle&quot; symbol is shown here:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math"><em>a</em> + <em>j</em><em>b</em> = <em>c</em><em>e</em><sup><em>j</em>Θ </sup></span><br /></p>
<p>Explain why this equivalence is mathematically sound.</p>
<p>The equivalence shown is based on <em>Euler’s relation</em>, which is left to you as an exercise to prove.</p>
<p>This question should probably be preceded by #04058, which asks students to explore the relationship between the infinite series for <span class="math"><em>e</em><sup><em>x</em></sup></span>, <span class="math">cos<em>x</em></span>, and <span class="math">sin<em>x</em></span>. In any case, your students will need to know Euler’s relation:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math"><em>e</em><sup><em>j</em><em>x</em></sup> = cos<em>x</em> + <em>j</em>sin<em>x</em></span><br /></p>
