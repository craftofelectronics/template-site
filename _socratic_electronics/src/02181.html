<p>Power calculation in DC circuits is simple. There are three formulae that may be used to calculate power:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$P = IV \hbox{\hskip 30pt} P = I^2 R \hbox{\hskip 30pt} P = {V^2 \over R} \hbox{\hskip 30pt Power in DC circuits}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Calculating power in AC circuits is much more complex, because there are three different types of power: <em>apparent</em> power (<span class="math"><em>S</em></span>), <em>true</em> power (<span class="math"><em>P</em></span>), and <em>reactive</em> power (<span class="math"><em>Q</em></span>). Write equations for calculating each of these types of power in an AC circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$S = IV \hbox{\hskip 30pt} S = I^2 Z \hbox{\hskip 30pt} S = {V^2 \over Z} \hbox{\hskip 30pt Apparent power in AC circuits}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$P = IV \cos \Theta \hbox{\hskip 30pt} P = I^2 R \hbox{\hskip 30pt} P = {V^2 \over R} \hbox{\hskip 30pt True power in AC circuits}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$Q = IV \sin \Theta \hbox{\hskip 30pt} Q = I^2 X \hbox{\hskip 30pt} Q = {V^2 \over X} \hbox{\hskip 30pt Reactive power in AC circuits}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Follow-up question #1: algebraically manipulate each of the following equations to solve for all the other variables in them:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$Q = I^2 X \hbox{\hskip 30pt} S = {V^2 \over Z} \hbox{\hskip 30pt} P = I^2 R$</span><br /></p>
<p>Follow-up question #2: substitute <span class="math"><em>Ï€</em></span>, <span class="math"><em>f</em></span>, and either <span class="math"><em>L</em></span> or <span class="math"><em>C</em></span> into the reactive power equations so that one may calculate <span class="math"><em>Q</em></span> without having to directly know the value of <span class="math"><em>X</em></span>.</p>
<p>Nothing much to comment on here, as these equations may be found in any number of texts. One thing you might consider doing to encourage participation from your students is to ask three of them to write these equations on the board in front of class, one student per power type (<span class="math"><em>S</em></span>, <span class="math"><em>P</em></span>, and <span class="math"><em>Q</em></span>). This would be an ideal question for your more timid students, because there is little explanation involved and therefore little chance of embarrassment.</p>
