<p>Calculate all voltage drops and currents in this circuit, complete with arrows for current direction and polarity markings for voltage polarity. Then, calculate the overall voltage gain of this amplifier circuit (<span class="math"><em>A</em><sub><em>V</em></sub></span>), both as a ratio and as a figure in units of decibels (dB):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02459x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02459x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math"><em>A</em><sub><em>V</em></sub></span> = 1.468 = 3.335 dB</p>
<p>Operational amplifier circuits provide a great opportunity to review basic concepts of DC circuits: voltage drops, polarity, current directions, Ohm’s Law, Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law, Kirchhoff’s Current Law, etc. This circuit is no exception. Emphasize the fact that a great many opamp circuits may be comprehensively analyzed merely with knowledge of these fundamental principles and the characteristics of an ideal opamp (zero input current, infinite open-loop gain, unlimited output voltage swing, zero voltage between input terminals when negative feedback is in effect).</p>
<p>Some students may arrive at the wrong gain figure because they blindly followed a formula with <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span> shown as variables, plugging in this circuit’s values for <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span> without considering which resistor is which (is <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> the feedback resistor or is <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span>?). This is by design, as I want students to learn to <em>think</em> about what they are doing rather than thoughtlessly follow instructions.</p>
