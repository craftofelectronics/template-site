<p>Digital logic circuitry makes use of discrete voltage levels: each &quot;logic gate&quot; sub-circuit inputs and outputs voltages that are either considered &quot;high&quot; or &quot;low&quot;. Define what both of these terms means in a digital logic circuit powered by 5 volts DC.</p>
<p>&quot;High&quot; = (nearly) 5 volts between the gate input/output and ground.</p>
<p>&quot;Low&quot; = (nearly) 0 volts between the gate input/output and ground.</p>
<p>This is a very simple concept, but worthwhile to cover in its own question just to be sure no students misunderstand when the concept is later applied.</p>
