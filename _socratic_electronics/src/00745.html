<p>Electromechanical watt-hour meters use an aluminum disk that is spun by an electric motor. To generate a constant &quot;drag&quot; on the disk necessary to limit its rotational speed, a strong magnet is placed in such a way that its lines of magnetic flux pass perpendicularly through the disk’s thickness:</p>

<p>The disk itself need not be made of a ferromagnetic material in order for the magnet to create a &quot;drag&quot; force. It simply needs to be a good conductor of electricity.</p>
<p>Explain the phenomenon accounting for the drag effect, and also explain what would happen if the roles of magnet and disk were reversed: if the magnet were moved in a circle around the periphery of a stationary disk.</p>
<p>This is an example of <em>Lenz’ Law</em>. A rotating magnet would cause a torque to be generated in the disk.</p>
<p>Mechanical speedometer assemblies used on many automobiles use this very principle: a magnet assembly is rotated by a cable connected to the vehicle’s driveshaft. This magnet rotates in close proximity to a metal disk, which gets &quot;dragged&quot; in the same direction that the magnet spins. The disk’s torque acts against the resistance of a spring, deflecting a pointer along a scale, indicating the speed of the vehicle. The faster the magnet spins, the more torque is felt by the disk.</p>
