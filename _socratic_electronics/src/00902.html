<p>In perfectly pure (&quot;intrinsic&quot;) semiconductors, the only way charge carriers can exist is for valence electrons to &quot;leap&quot; into the conduction band with the application of sufficient energy, leaving a <em>hole</em>, or vacancy, behind in the valence band:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00902x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>With sufficient thermal energy, these electron-hole pairs will form spontaneously. At room temperature, however, this activity is slight.</p>
<p>We may greatly enhance charge carrier formation by adding specific impurities to the semiconducting material. The energy states of atoms having different electron configurations do not precisely &quot;blend&quot; with the electron bands of the parent semiconductor crystal, causing additional energy levels to form.</p>
<p>Some types of impurities will cause extra <em>donor</em> electrons to lurk just beneath the main conduction band of the crystal. These types of impurities are called <em>pentavalent</em>, because they have 5 valence electrons per atom rather than 4 as the parent substance typically possesses:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00902x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Other types of impurities will cause vacant electron levels (<em>acceptor</em> &quot;holes&quot;) to form just above the main valence band of the crystal. These types of impurities are called <em>trivalent</em>, because they have 3 valence electrons per atom instead of 4:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00902x03.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Compare the ease of forming free (conduction-band) electrons in a semiconductor material having lots of &quot;donor&quot; electrons, against that of an intrinsic (pure) semiconductor material. Which type of material will be more electrically conductive?</p>
<p>Likewise, compare the ease of forming valence-band holes in a semiconductor material having lots of &quot;acceptor&quot; holes, against that of an intrinsic (pure) semiconductor material. Which type of material will be more electrically conductive?</p>
<p>Under the influence of thermal energy from ambient sources, pentavalent &quot;donor&quot; atoms contribute to free electrons in the conduction band:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00902x04.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Likewise, trivalent &quot;acceptor&quot; atoms contribute to holes in the valence band:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00902x05.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>In either case, the addition of impurities to an otherwise pure semiconductor material increases the number of available charge carriers.</p>
<p>The most important concept for students to grasp here is that the addition of impurities increases the number of available <em>charge carriers</em> in a semiconducting substance. What was essentially an insulator in its pure state may be made conductive to varying degrees by adding impurities.</p>
