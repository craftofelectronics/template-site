<p>In this 480 volt AC induction motor control circuit, a three-pole relay (typically called a <em>contactor</em>) is used to switch power on and off to the motor. The contactor itself is controlled by a smaller switch, which gets 120 volts AC from a step-down transformer to energize the contactor’s magnetic coil. Although this motor control circuit used to work just fine, today the motor refuses to start.</p>

<p>Using your AC voltmeter, you measure 476 volts AC between L1 and L2, 477 volts AC between L2 and L3, and 475 volts AC between L1 and L3. You also measure 477 volts between transformer terminals H1 and H4. With the switch in the &quot;on&quot; position, you measure 0.5 volts AC between terminals X1 and X2 on the transformer. From this information, identify the following:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> components or wires in the circuit that you know cannot be failed either open or shorted, besides the 480 volt AC source which is obviously operational.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> different component or wire failures in the circuit, either one of which could account for the problem and the measurement values, and the types of failures they would be (either open or shorted).</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> The center (L2) and right (L3) fuses</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> All wires from fuses to transformer primary</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Transformer primary winding(s) failed open</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Transformer secondary winding failed open or failed shorted</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Jumper wire from H2 to H3 failed open</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Contactor coil failed shorted</p>
