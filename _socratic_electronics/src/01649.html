<p>Use circuit simulation software to verify your predicted and measured parameter values.</p>
<p>Students may use potentiometers in their range resistance networks to achieve precise values. However, they are not allowed to adjust those potentiometers after connecting them to the meter movement – they must set their potentiometer(s) during the &quot;prediction&quot; step of the assessment before the circuit is completely built.</p>
<p>An extension of this exercise is to incorporate troubleshooting questions. Whether using this exercise as a performance assessment or simply as a concept-building lab, you might want to follow up your students’ results by asking them to predict the consequences of certain circuit faults.</p>
