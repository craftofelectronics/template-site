<p>What does it mean to speak of the <em>gain</em> of a circuit? This term is very commonly used when describing amplifier circuits, but it may also be used to describe circuits containing nothing but passive components, and are thus incapable of amplifying.</p>
<p>What letter is used to symbolize gain in mathematical equations?</p>
<p>&quot;Gain&quot; (<span class="math"><em>A</em></span>) refers to the ratio of output signal compared to input signal.</p>
<p>Discuss what it means for a circuit to have a designated &quot;output&quot; and &quot;input&quot;. Can they think of any circuits studied thus far that have places to input and output signals?</p>
