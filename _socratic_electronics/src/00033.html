<p>Which components are guaranteed to share the exact same <em>voltage</em> by virtue of their connections with each other? Which components are guaranteed to share the exact same <em>current</em> by virtue of their connections with each other?</p>

<p>The lamp, C1, and D1 are all guaranteed to share the exact same voltage. The battery and R1 are both guaranteed to share the exact same current.</p>
<p>Here, the important relations between voltage, current, and component connection patterns are explored. This serves to further define, in practical ways, what the terms &quot;series&quot; and &quot;parallel&quot; really mean.</p>
