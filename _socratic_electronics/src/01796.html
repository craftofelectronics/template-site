<p>Suppose you tried to measure the voltage at all three test points with an analog voltmeter having a sensitivity rating of 20 k<span class="math">Ω </span> per volt, set on the 10 volt scale. How much voltage would it indicate at each test point? How much voltage <em>should</em> it ideally indicate at each test point?</p>

<p>An analogy I often use to explain meter loading is the use of a pressure gauge to measure the air pressure in a pneumatic tire. In order to measure the pressure, some of the air must be let out of the tire, which of course changes the tire’s air pressure.</p>
<p>And in case you are wondering: no, this is <em>not</em> an example of Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle, popularly misunderstood as error introduced by measurement. The Uncertainty Principle is far more profound than this!</p>
