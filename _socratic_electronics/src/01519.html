<p>The best regulator designs use <em>feedback</em> to ensure &quot;tight&quot; regulation of voltage over a wide range of load currents. Explain what this &quot;feedback&quot; is, and how it works to improve voltage regulation.</p>
<p>With &quot;feedback,&quot; the output voltage is sampled and &quot;fed back&quot; to a prior stage in the transistor circuit, so that any load-induced change in output voltage elicits a response from the amplifier to counter-act that change. In other words, feedback makes the circuit &quot;aware&quot; of its own output.</p>
<p>Many voltage regulator circuits employ operational amplifiers (using negative feedback) to accomplish this very design goal: improved voltage regulation. Your students may find a perusal of an op-amp based design helpful when considering how to build their regulator circuits out of discrete components.</p>
