<p>When technicians and engineers consider harmonics in AC power systems, they usually only consider <em>odd-numbered</em> harmonic frequencies. Explain why this is.</p>
<p>Nonlinear loads are usually (but not always!) symmetrical in their distortion.</p>
<p>Iâ€™ve had electrical power system experts confidently tell me that even-numbered harmonics <em>cannot</em> exist in AC power systems, due to some deep mathematical principle mysteriously beyond their ability to describe or explain. Rubbish! Even-numbered harmonics can and do appear in AC power systems, although they are typically much lower in amplitude than the odd-numbered harmonics due to the nature of most nonlinear loads.</p>
<p>If you ever wish to prove the existence of even-numbered harmonics in a power system, all you have to do is analyze the input current waveform of a half-wave rectifier!</p>
