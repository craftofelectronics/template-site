<p>Write an equation solving for the temperature of a conductor (<span class="math"><em>T</em></span>), given its resistance at that temperature (<span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>T</em></sub></span>), its resistance at a standard reference temperature (<span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>r</em></sub></span> @ <span class="math"><em>T</em><sub><em>r</em></sub></span>), and its temperature coefficient of resistance at that same reference temperature (<span class="math"><em>Î±</em></span> @ <span class="math"><em>T</em><sub><em>r</em></sub></span>).</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$T = {{{R_T \over R_r} - 1} \over \alpha} + T_r$</span><br /></p>
<p>Students may be able to find this equation in a textbook somewhere, but the point of this question is really to have them perform algebraic manipulation to derive this equation from another.</p>
