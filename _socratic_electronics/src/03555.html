<p>Determine the capacitor voltage at the specified times (time <span class="math"><em>t</em></span> = 0 milliseconds being the exact moment the switch contacts close). Assume the capacitor begins in a fully discharged state:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03555x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math"></span><br /><span class="math">$\underbar{file 03555}$</span><br /><span class="math"></span></p>
<p>Be sure to have your students share their problem-solving techniques (how they determined which equation to use, etc.) in class.</p>
