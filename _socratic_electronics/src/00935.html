<p>A simple &quot;follower&quot; circuit that boosts the current-output ability of this noninverting amplifier circuit is a set of bipolar junction transistors, connected together in a &quot;push-pull&quot; fashion like this:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00935x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>However, if connected exactly as shown, there will be a significant voltage error introduced to the opampâ€™s output. No longer will the final output voltage (measured across the load) be an exact 3:1 multiple of the input voltage, due to the 0.7 volts dropped by the transistor in active mode:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00935x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>There is a very simple way to completely eliminate this error, without adding any additional components. Modify the circuit accordingly.</p>

<p>If you understand why this circuit works, pat yourself on the back: you truly understand the self-correcting nature of negative feedback. If not, you have a bit more studying to do!</p>
<p>The answer is not meant to be discouraging for those students of yours who do not understand how the solution works. It is simply a &quot;litmus test&quot; of whether or not your students really comprehend the concept of negative feedback. Although the change made in the circuit is simple, the principle is a bit of a conceptual leap for some people.</p>
<p>It might help your students understand if you label the new wire with the word <em>sense</em>, to indicate its purpose of providing feedback from the very output of the circuit, back to the opamp so it can sense how much voltage the load is receiving.</p>
