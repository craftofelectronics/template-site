<p>Calculate the amount of time it takes for a 10 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>F capacitor to discharge from 18 volts to 7 volts if its ultimate (final) voltage when fully discharged will be 0 volts, and it is discharging through a 22 k<span class="math">Ω </span> resistor.</p>
<p>0.208 seconds</p>
<p>In order for students to solve this problem, they must algebraically manipulate the &quot;normal&quot; time-constant formula to solve for time instead of solving for voltage.</p>
