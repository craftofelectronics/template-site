<p>What provisions are provided on the integrated circuit for adjusting the distortion of the sine wave output? Explain how you would determine when the sine wave output was properly adjusted (for minimal distortion). What test equipment would be ideal to use for this purpose, and how would that test equipment be set up on your circuit?</p>
<p>Although an oscilloscope could be used to make coarse adjustments, the best instrument by far for this purpose would be a <em>spectrum analyzer</em>.</p>
<p>Professional-quality spectrum analyzers may not exist in your lab, but do not worry. There are several high-quality devices built to interface with a personal computer that are capable of displaying spectrum analyses. If all you care about is low frequency (audio range) analysis, you can even get away with using a personal computer sound card (with the appropriate software) as the analysis device.</p>
