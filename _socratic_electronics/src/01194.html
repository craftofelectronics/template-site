<p>One method used to bias enhancement-mode IGFETs is <em>drain-feedback</em> biasing. An example is shown here:</p>

<p>Another method of biasing enhancement-mode IGFETs is the <em>voltage divider</em> technique, which should be familiar to you from your understanding of BJT amplifier circuits:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01194x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>How do you think the performance of these two differently-biased circuits compare? Assuming they were both biased for the same Q-point, would there be any significant difference(s) in their signal amplifying performance? Why or why not?</p>
<p>One of these circuits has the potential for much greater voltage gain. I’ll let you determine which one, and more importantly, why.</p>
<p>This question is a good test of your students’ comprehension of feedback in transistor circuits: what it is, what causes it, and what its effects are.</p>
<p>Ask your students whether they think the technique of drain-feedback biasing would work in a depletion-mode IGFET amplifier circuit.</p>
