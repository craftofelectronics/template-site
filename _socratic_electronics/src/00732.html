<p>What will happen to the function of this ammeter circuit, if the wire marked in the illustration were to fail open?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00732x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>If the wire were to fail open, the ammeter would not respond at all to any amount of input current.</p>
<p>Some students may think the ammeter will fail to respond at all with an open resistor, because they associate &quot;open&quot; faults with lack of current, and lack of current with zero response from the meter movement. Careful examination of the circuit, however, reveals that the exact opposite will happen.</p>
