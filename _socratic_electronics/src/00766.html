<p>In active and passive filter design literature, you often come across filter circuits classified as one of three different names:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Chebyshev</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Butterworth</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Bessel</p>
<p>Describe what each of these names means. What, exactly, distinguishes a &quot;Chebyshev&quot; filter circuit from a &quot;Butterworth&quot; filter circuit?</p>
<p>Each of these terms describes a class of filter <em>responses</em>, rather than a particular circuit configuration (topology). The shape of the Bode plot for a filter circuit is the determining factor for whether it will be a &quot;Chebyshev,&quot; &quot;Butterworth,&quot; or &quot;Bessel&quot; filter.</p>
<p>I purposely omitted Bode plot examples for these three filter classifications. Presentation and examination of Bode plots is an appropriate activity for discussion time. Draw a set of Bode plot axes on the whiteboard, and then have students draw approximate Bode plots for each filter response, as determined from their research.</p>
