<p>A water-cooled generator at a power plant has two sources of cooling water flow, each source equipped with a flow switch that returns to its normally-open status if the water flow through the pipe stops. If either water source ceases supplying cooling water to the generator (for whatever reason), that flow switch will de-actuate and turn the warning light on. This is all that is required, as the generator will still receive adequate cooling from only one source. If both water sources cease supplying water, however, a &quot;trip&quot; solenoid will energize to shut down the generator before it overheats:</p>

<p>One day the warning light comes on, but there is still cooling water to the generator so it does not shut down. You are asked to determine what the problem is. Using your voltmeter, you measure 115 volts AC between TP4 and L2, and 115 volts AC between TP8 and L2. From this information, identify two possible causes that could account for the warning light status and all measured values in this circuit. Then, choose one of those possible causes and explain why you think it could be to blame. The possible causes you identify can be non-electrical as well as electrical in nature. Be as specific as you can in your answers.</p>
