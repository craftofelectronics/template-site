<p>A popular variation of the Class B amplifier is the <em>Class AB</em> amplifier, designed to eliminate any trace of crossover distortion. What makes the difference between a Class B and a Class AB amplifier? Why do Class AB amplifiers have less crossover distortion than Class B amplifiers? And, is there any disadvantage to changing from Class B to Class AB operation?</p>
<p>The fundamental difference between Class B and Class AB operation is biasing: both transistors are &quot;on&quot; for a brief moment in time around the zero-crossover point in a Class AB circuit, where only one transistor is supposed to be on at any given time in a Class B circuit.</p>
<p>Amplifiers operating in Class AB mode are less power-efficient than pure Class B operation.</p>
<p>Ask your students to specifically identify the change(s) that would have to be made in the following Class B circuit to make it operate as a Class AB amplifier:</p>

<p>Discuss why the name &quot;Class AB&quot; is given to this mode of operation. How does Class AB operation differ from pure Class A or pure Class B?</p>
