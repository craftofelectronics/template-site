<p>How does the behavior of a <em>zener diode</em> differ substantially from that of a normal (rectifying) diode?</p>
<p>Zener diodes break down at substantially lower reverse voltages than rectifying diodes, and their breakdown voltages are predictable.</p>
<p>Ask students what zener diodes would likely be used for. Why would we need or desire a device with a stable breakdown voltage?</p>
