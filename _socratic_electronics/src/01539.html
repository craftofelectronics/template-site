<p>An important parameter in capacitor performance is <em>ESR</em>. Define ESR, and explain what causes it.</p>
<p>&quot;ESR&quot; stands for <em>Equivalent Series Resistance</em>, usually being a consequence of the capacitorâ€™s dielectric substance.</p>
<p>Discuss with your students why ESR matters, especially in decoupling applications where capacitors are expected to handle large <span class="math">${dv \over dt}$</span> transients.</p>
