<p>This three-phase motor control circuit contains both <em>overload heaters</em> and <em>fuses</em>:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02376x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Explain why both types of devices are important in this circuit. Why not just use fuses only, or just use overload heaters only? What unique functions do each of these overcurrent protection devices perform that necessitates them <em>both</em> being in the circuit?</p>
<p>Fuses primarily protect the wiring feeding power to the motor, while overload heaters are designed to protect the motor itself (and nothing but).</p>
