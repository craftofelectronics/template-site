<p>Suppose a short-circuit were to develop in this electric power system:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00380x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The purpose of the circuit breaker, of course, is to open the circuit automatically, to prevent damage to the power conductors. In a large electric power system, the magnitudes of such short-circuit currents can be enormous.</p>
<p>Large inductors, commonly called <em>reactors</em>, are often installed in series with power conductors in high-voltage power systems in order to &quot;soften&quot; the onset of short-circuit currents:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00380x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Explain how the addition of a &quot;reactor&quot; helps to minimize the magnitude of the short-circuit current the breaker has to interrupt.</p>
<p>At the moment that a short-circuit fault occurs, the sudden increase in current constitutes a very large <span class="math">${di \over dt}$</span> value, which the inductor momentarily &quot;opposes&quot; by dropping voltage.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: why use an inductor to limit the short-circuit fault current? Why not use a resistor instead?</p>
<p>Power system reactors are usually installed in substations, where they appear as coils of wire (no iron core) a few feet in diameter, usually located near circuit breakers.</p>
