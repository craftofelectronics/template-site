<p>When a capacitor is to be connected in parallel with an inductive AC load to correct for lagging power factor, it is important to be able to calculate the reactive power of the capacitor (<span class="math"><em>Q</em><sub><em>C</em></sub></span>). Write at least one equation for calculating the reactive power of a capacitor (in VARs) given the capacitorâ€™s reactance (<span class="math"><em>X</em><sub><em>C</em></sub></span>) at the line frequency.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$Q_C = {E^2 \over X_C} \hbox{\hskip 40pt} Q_C = I^2 X_C$</span><br /></p>
<p>Follow-up question: which of the two equations shown above would be easiest to use in calculating the reactive power of a capacitor given the following information?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02189x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>This step seems to be one of the most difficult for students to grasp as they begin to learn to correct for power factor in AC circuits, so I wrote a question specifically focusing on it. Once students calculate the amount of reactive power consumed by the load (<span class="math"><em>Q</em><sub><em>l</em><em>o</em><em>a</em><em>d</em></sub></span>), they may realize the capacitor needs to produce the same (<span class="math"><em>Q</em><sub><em>C</em></sub></span>), but they often become mired in confusion trying to take the next step(s) in determining capacitor size.</p>
