<p>These two phasors are written in a form known as <em>polar notation</em>. Re-write them in <em>rectangular notation</em>:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">4 ∠ 0<sup><em>o</em></sup> = </span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">3 ∠ 90<sup><em>o</em></sup> = </span><br /></p>
<p>These two phasors, written in rectangular notation, would be <span class="math">4 + <em>j</em>0</span> and <span class="math">0 + <em>j</em>3</span>, respectively, although a mathematician would probably write them as <span class="math">4 + <em>i</em>0</span> and <span class="math">0 + <em>i</em>3</span>, respectively.</p>
<p>Challenge question: what does the lower-case <span class="math"><em>j</em></span> or <span class="math"><em>i</em></span> represent, in mathematical terms?</p>
<p>Discuss with your students the two notations commonly used with phasors: <em>polar</em> and <em>rectangular</em> form. They are merely two different ways of &quot;saying&quot; the same thing. A helpful &quot;prop&quot; for this discussion is the complex number <em>plane</em> (as opposed to a number <em>line</em> – a one-dimensional field), showing the &quot;real&quot; and &quot;imaginary&quot; axes, in addition to standard angles (right = 0<span class="math">$^{o}$</span>, left = 180<span class="math">$^{o}$</span>, up = 90<span class="math">$^{o}$</span>, down = 270<span class="math">$^{o}$</span>). Your students should be familiar with this from their research, so have one of them draw the number plane on the whiteboard for all to view.</p>
<p>The challenge question regards the origin of complex numbers, beginning with the distinction of &quot;imaginary&quot; numbers as being a separate set of quantities from &quot;real&quot; numbers. Electrical engineers, of course, avoid using the lower-case letter <span class="math"><em>i</em></span> to denote &quot;imaginary&quot; because it would be so easily be confused with the standard notation for instantaneous current <span class="math"><em>i</em></span>.</p>
