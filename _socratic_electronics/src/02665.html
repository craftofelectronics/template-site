<p>The following comparator circuit was built by an avid kite flyer, who wanted a circuit to alert him to abnormal wind conditions. Is this circuit configured to act as a <em>high</em> wind speed alarm, or a <em>low</em> wind speed alarm? Also, show which way the potentiometer wiper would have to be moved in order to obtain a higher wind speed alarm point.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02665x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>This is a <em>high</em> speed alarm, and the wiper would have to be moved <em>up</em> to raise the wind speed threshold value.</p>
