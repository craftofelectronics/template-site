<p>Suppose this microphone amplifier circuit used to function fine, but now has stopped outputting any sound at all:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03743x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Initial diagnostic measurements show all quiescent (DC) voltages to be normal. From this data, where would you suspect the problem is, and where would you suspect the problem is <em>not</em>?</p>
<p>The problem is <em>not</em> in any of the four resistors, or the transistor. The most likely components to suspect at this point would be the microphone, capacitors, transformer, and/or speaker.</p>
<p>Ask your students why the normal DC voltage measurements indicate healthy resistors and transistor. How can we quickly eliminate those components as being faulty based on simple DC voltage measurements?</p>
