<p>A <em>soldering gun</em> is a tool used to quickly heat electrical connections for soldering. Too bulky for printed-circuit board (PCB) applications, it is better suited for point-to-point wiring applications where large wires are to be joined to metal lugs and to other wires.</p>
<p>In addition to being a useful soldering tool, this device is also an excellent example of a <em>step-down transformer</em>. Explain how the construction of a soldering gun employs a step-down transformer (with a very large step ratio!) to generate high temperatures at the soldering tip.</p>
<p>This question is best answered through disassembly and inspection of a real soldering gun. These tools are fairly easy to take apart and reassemble, so there should be little concern of damage from such exploration. Although it should go without saying, <em>never disassemble an electrical device that is still connected to line power!</em></p>
<p>For students lacking soldering guns to take apart, and for those who do not want to take any chances ruining a tool through improper disassembly/reassembly, it is not difficult to find photographs of soldering gun internals. The step-down transformer assembly should be obvious when inspected.</p>
