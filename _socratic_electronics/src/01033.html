<p>Photodiodes, phototransistors, and light-emitting diodes all play important roles in <em>optical communications networks</em>, where digital (on/off) signals are communicated over long distances as pulses of light energy rather than voltage or current.</p>
<p>Why are LEDs greatly preferred over other electro-optical devices such as incandescent lamps or gas-discharge bulbs? What can an LED do that a small electric lamp cannot?</p>
<p>Semiconductor-based light emitting devices are capable of turning on and off much, much faster than incandescent or gas-discharge devices.</p>
<p>In digital communications networks, speed is an essential quality. Ask your students why this is so, and by association, why semiconductor-based light sources are almost exclusively used in optical networks.</p>
