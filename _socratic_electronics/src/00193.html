<p>How does the rate of charge flow (current) into and out of a capacitor relate to the amount of voltage across its terminals? How does the rate of water flow into and out of a vessel relate to the amount of water stored in that vessel?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00193x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Rather than simply give you an answer here, Iâ€™ll let you figure this out for yourself. Think very carefully about the water-in-a-vessel analogy when answering this question! Fill a glass with water, if necessary, to gain an intuitive understanding of these quantities.</p>
<p>The existence of such an appropriate analogy for capacitor action makes an explanation unnecessary, even if the concept takes a bit of thought to comprehend at first. It is important that students clearly distinguish the quantities of <em>current</em>, <em>voltage</em>, and <em>charge</em> in a capacitor circuit just as they clearly distinguish the quantities of <em>liquid height</em>, <em>flow rate</em>, and <em>liquid volume</em> in a hydraulic system.</p>
