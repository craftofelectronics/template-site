<p>What is the difference between <em>DC</em> and <em>AC</em> electricity?</p>
<p><em>DC</em> is an acronym meaning <em>Direct Current</em>: that is, electrical current that moves in one direction only. <em>AC</em> is an acronym meaning <em>Alternating Current</em>: that is, electrical current that periodically reverses direction (&quot;alternates&quot;).</p>
<p>It is important to realize that &quot;DC&quot; and &quot;AC&quot; may also be used to represent <em>voltage</em> as well as current. That is, it is possible to have a voltage that alternates back and forth in polarity (&quot;AC&quot; voltage) just as it is possible to have a current that alternates back and forth in direction of motion.</p>
<p>Though it may seem oxymoronic to refer to either &quot;DC&quot; or &quot;AC&quot; voltage (Direct Current voltage, or Alternating Current voltage â€“ &quot;current voltage&quot;?), the usage of these acronyms as such is commonplace.</p>
