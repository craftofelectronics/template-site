<p>What would be wrong about measuring the resistance of a light bulb while it is being powered by a battery?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00306x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The voltage impressed across the light bulb by the battery will interfere with the ohmmeter’s measurement.</p>
<p>This principle is very easy to illustrate, simply by building a &quot;live&quot; circuit and trying to measure the resistance of a known component in that circuit, while energized. Different ohmmeters will, of course, respond differently to this abuse, but none will yield the proper value for that component’s resistance.</p>
