<p>Observe the following equivalence:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">${4^3 \over 4^2} = {{4 \times 4 \times 4} \over {4 \times 4}}$</span><br /></p>
<p>It should be readily apparent that we may cancel out two quantities from both top and bottom of the fraction, so in the end we are left with this:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$4 \over 1$</span><br /></p>
<p>Re-writing this using exponents, we get <span class="math">4<sup>1</sup></span>.</p>
<p>Expand each of these expressions so that there are no exponents either:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math">${3^5 \over 3^2} = $</span></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math">${10^6 \over 10^4} = $</span></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math">${8^7 \over 8^3} = $</span></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math">${20^5 \over 20^4} = $</span></p>
<p>After expanding each of these expressions, re-write each one in simplest form: one number to a power, just like the final form of the example given (<span class="math">4<sup>1</sup></span>). From these examples, what pattern do you see with exponents of products. In other words, what is the general solution to the following expression?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">${a^m \over a^n} =$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">${a^m \over a^n} = a^{m-n}$</span><br /></p>
<p>I have found that students who cannot fathom the general rule (<span class="math">${a^m \over a^n} = a^{m-n}$</span>) often understand for the first time when they see concrete examples.</p>
