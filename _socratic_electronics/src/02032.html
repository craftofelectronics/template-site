<p>If we were to compare the energy diagrams for three pieces of semiconducting material, two &quot;N&quot; type and one &quot;P&quot; type, side-by-side, we would see something like this:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02032x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The presence of dopants in the semiconducting materials creates differences in the Fermi energy level (<span class="math"><em>E</em><sub><em>f</em></sub></span>) within each piece.</p>
<p>Draw a new energy diagram showing the equilibrium state of the three pieces after being joined together.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02032x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>If students are familiar with energy band diagrams for PN diode junctions, they should have no great difficulty drawing an energy diagram for an NPN junction.</p>
