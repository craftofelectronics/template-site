<p>A useful test instrument for digital gate circuit troubleshooting is a <em>logic pulser</em>. Explain what one is and give an example of how it is used.</p>
<p>Since most digital electronics textbooks discuss logic pulsers along with logic probes, I’ll let you do the research here and share with your classmates and instructor what you found!</p>
<p>Students may wonder how a logic pulser is able to override the output state of any gate it’s connected to. The answer has to do with the brief time that a pulser operates, and also the pulser’s low impedance (compared to the relatively high impedance of the overridden gate output).</p>
