<p>Frequency used to be expressed in units of <em>cycles per second</em>, abbreviated as <em>CPS</em>. Now, the standardized unit is <em>Hertz</em>. Explain the meaning of the obsolete frequency unit: what, exactly, does it mean for an AC voltage or current to have <span class="math"><em>x</em></span> number of &quot;cycles per second?&quot;</p>
<p>Each time an AC voltage or current repeats itself, that interval is called a <em>cycle</em>. Frequency, being the rate at which an AC voltage or current repeats itself over time, may be represented in terms of cycles (repetitions) per second.</p>
<p>Encourage your students to discuss the origins of the new unit (Hertz), and how it actually communicates less information about the thing being measured than the old unit (CPS).</p>
