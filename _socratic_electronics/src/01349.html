<p>The circuit shown here is called an <em>S-R latch</em>:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01349x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Complete the truth table for this latch circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01349x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01349x03.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Follow-up question: The final state of this truth table (where the &quot;Set&quot; and &quot;Reset&quot; inputs are both high) is usually referred to as <em>invalid</em>. Explain why.</p>
<p>The &quot;latch&quot; state is the most interesting in this circuit. Discuss what this means with your students, especially since it is impossible to describe the &quot;latch&quot; state in terms of fixed 1’s and 0’s.</p>
