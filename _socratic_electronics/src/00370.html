<p>Suppose an ammeter has a range of 0 to 1 milliamp, and an internal resistance of 1000 <span class="math">Ω </span>:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00370x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Show how a single resistor could be connected to this ammeter to extend its range to <em>0 to 10</em> amps. Calculate the resistance of this &quot;range&quot; resistor, as well as its necessary power dissipation rating.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00370x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>A power dissipation rating of at least 10 watts is necessary for this application.</p>
<p>Ammeter ranging is a very practical example of current divider circuitry.</p>
