<p>Determine the amount of time needed after switch closure for the capacitor voltage (<span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>C</em></sub></span>) to reach the specified levels:</p>

<p>Some students may write 5.17 seconds as the time required to charge to 40 volts (5 time constants’ worth of time). If so, remind them that the &quot;standard&quot; of 5<span class="math"><em>τ</em></span> is arbitrary, and that theoretically the capacitor <em>never</em> actually reaches full charge.</p>
