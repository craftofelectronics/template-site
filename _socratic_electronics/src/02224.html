<p>Complete the table of output voltages for several given values of input voltage in this common-collector amplifier circuit. Assume that the transistor is a standard silicon NPN unit, with a nominal base-emitter junction forward voltage of 0.7 volts:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02224x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math"></span><br /><span class="math">$Based on the values you calculate, explain why the common-collector circuit configuration is often referred to as an {\it emitter follower}.

\underbar{file 02224}$</span><br /><span class="math"></span> The voltage at the transistorâ€™s emitter terminal approximately &quot;follows&quot; the voltage applied to the base terminal, hence the name.</p>
<p>At first, the &quot;emitter follower&quot; transistor circuit may seem pointless, since the output voltage practically equals the input voltage (especially for input voltages greatly exceeding 0.7 volts DC). &quot;What possible good is a circuit like this?&quot; some of your students may ask. The answer to this question, of course, has to do with <em>currents</em> in the circuit, and not necessarily voltages.</p>
