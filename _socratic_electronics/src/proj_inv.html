<hr />
<p>Your project is to design and build a power inverter to convert 12 volts DC to 120 volts AC. A suggested circuit is shown here:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{proj_inv.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Please note that this is only a general schematic, and may not be exactly what you need to build in order to have a successful inverter circuit. Your choice of specific power components (transformer, power MOSFETs, zener diodes) are critical. Paralleled MOSFETs and zener diodes may very well be in order!</p>
