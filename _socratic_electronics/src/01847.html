<p>Due to the effects of a changing electric field on the dielectric of a capacitor, some energy is dissipated in capacitors subjected to AC. Generally, this is not very much, but it is there. This dissipative behavior is typically modeled as a series-connected resistance:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01847x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Calculate the magnitude and phase shift of the current through this capacitor, taking into consideration its equivalent series resistance (ESR):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01847x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Compare this against the magnitude and phase shift of the current for an ideal 0.22 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>F capacitor.</p>
<p><span class="math">${\bf I} =$</span> 3.732206 mA <span class="math">∠</span> 89.89<span class="math">$^{o}$</span> for the real capacitor with ESR.</p>
<p><span class="math">${\bf I} =$</span> 3.732212 mA <span class="math">∠</span> 90.00<span class="math">$^{o}$</span> for the ideal capacitor.</p>
<p>Follow-up question #1: can this ESR be detected by a DC meter check of the capacitor? Why or why not?</p>
<p>Follow-up question #2: explain how the ESR of a capacitor can lead to physical heating of the component, especially under high-voltage, high-frequency conditions. What safety concerns might arise as a result of this?</p>
<p>Although capacitors do contain their own parasitic effects, ESR being one of them, they still tend to be much &quot;purer&quot; components than inductors for general use. This is another reason why capacitors are generally favored over inductors in applications where either will suffice.</p>
