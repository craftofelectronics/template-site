<p>Explain how this bridge circuit is capable of being &quot;balanced&quot; for <em>any</em> values of <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span>:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03474x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The potentiometer acts as a complementary pair of resistors: moving the wiper one direction increases the value of one while decrease the value of the other. Thus, it forms a voltage divider with an infinitely adjustable division ratio of 0% to 100%, inclusive.</p>
<p>This question showcases one more use of the potentiometer: as a voltage divider used specifically to balance a bridge circuit for any arbitrary values of fixed resistances. If students have difficulty seeing how this is possible, you might want to try representing the pot as a pair of fixed resistors (<span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>3</sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>4</sub></span>), the wiper position determining the balance of those two resistance values (<span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>p</em><em>o</em><em>t</em></sub> = <em>R</em><sub>1</sub> + <em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span>).</p>
