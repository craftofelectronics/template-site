<p>Product-of-Sum Boolean expressions all follow the same general form. As such, their equivalent logic gate circuits likewise follow a common form. Translate each of these POS expressions into its equivalent logic gate circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$(A + B)(A + \overline{B})$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$(A + \overline{B})(\overline{A} + B)$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$(A + B + C)(\overline{A} + B + \overline{C})(A + B + \overline{C})$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01336x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01336x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01336x03.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The translation from Boolean POS to gate circuit should not be difficult. The point of this question is to get students thinking in terms of sum-of-products form, so they will be ready for the next step: linking this concept with truth tables.</p>
