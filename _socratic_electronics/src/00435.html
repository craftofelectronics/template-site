<p>Graph both the inductor voltage (<span class="math"><em>E</em><sub><em>L</em></sub></span>) and the inductor current (<span class="math"><em>I</em><sub><em>L</em></sub></span>) over time as the switch is closed in this circuit:</p>

<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00435x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Have your students explain why the voltage and current curves are shaped as they are.</p>
