<p>This phase-shifting bridge circuit is supposed to provide an output voltage with a variable phase shift from -45<span class="math">$^{o}$</span> (lagging) to +45<span class="math">$^{o}$</span> (leading), depending on the position of the potentiometer wiper:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03465x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Suppose, though, that the output signal is stuck at -45<span class="math">$^{o}$</span> lagging the source voltage, no matter where the potentiometer is set. Identify a likely failure that could cause this to happen, and explain why this failure could account for the circuit’s strange behavior.</p>
<p>A broken connection between the right-hand terminal of the potentiometer and the bridge could cause this to happen:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03465x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>I’ll let you figure out why!</p>
<p>It is essential, of course, that students understand the operational principle of this circuit before they may even attempt to diagnose possible faults. You may find it necessary to discuss this circuit in detail with your students before they are ready to troubleshoot it.</p>
<p>In case anyone asks, the symbolism <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>p</em><em>o</em><em>t</em></sub> &gt;  &gt; <em>R</em></span> means &quot;potentiometer resistance is <em>much</em> greater than the fixed resistance value.&quot;</p>
