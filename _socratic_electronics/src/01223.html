<p>In digital computer systems, binary numbers are often represented by a fixed number of bits, such as 8, or 16, or 32. Such bit groupings are often given special names, because they are so common in digital systems:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> byte</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> nybble</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> word</p>
<p>How many binary bits is represented by each of the above terms?</p>
<p>And, for those looking for more challenge, try defining these terms:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> nickle</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> deckle</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> chawmp</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> playte</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> dynner</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> byte = 8 bits</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> nybble = 4 bits</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> word = <em>depends on the system</em></p>
<p>The term &quot;word,&quot; is often used to represent 16 bits, but it really depends on the particular system being spoken of. A binary &quot;word&quot; is more accurately defined as the default width of a binary bit grouping in a digital system.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: what binary grouping corresponds to a single hexadecimal character?</p>
