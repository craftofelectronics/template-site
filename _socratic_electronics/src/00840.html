<p>The simplest and least expensive style of electric motor control is the so-called <em>across-the-line</em> starter. Describe how this motor control circuit functions, and also define the word &quot;starter&quot; in this context.</p>
<p>A &quot;starter&quot; is another name for the large power relay used to conduct current to the motor lines. Starters are also known as <em>contactors</em>, and are usually labeled with the letter &quot;M&quot; in ladder diagrams.</p>
<p>Ask your students to identify any motor control circuit diagrams theyâ€™ve already seen as being &quot;across-the-line.&quot; If there are no convenient motor control circuit diagrams available for illustration, you may want to ask a student to draw an &quot;across-the-line&quot; starter circuit on the whiteboard for everyone to see.</p>
