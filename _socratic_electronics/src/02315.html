<p>Qualitatively determine what will happen to the series resistor current and the zener diode current in this voltage regulator circuit if the load current suddenly <em>decreases</em>. Assume that the zener diodeâ€™s behavior is ideal; i.e. its voltage drop holds absolutely constant throughout its operating range.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02315x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math"><em>I</em><sub><em>R</em><sub><em>s</em><em>e</em><em>r</em><em>i</em><em>e</em><em>s</em></sub></sub></span> = (<em>increase, decrease, or unchanged?</em>)</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>I</em><sub><em>z</em><em>e</em><em>n</em><em>e</em><em>r</em></sub></span> = (<em>increase, decrease, or unchanged?</em>)</p>
<p>If the load current decreases, <span class="math"><em>I</em><sub><em>z</em><em>e</em><em>n</em><em>e</em><em>r</em></sub></span> will increase and <span class="math"><em>I</em><sub><em>R</em><sub><em>s</em><em>e</em><em>r</em><em>i</em><em>e</em><em>s</em></sub></sub></span> will remain unchanged.</p>
<p>Challenge question: what do you think will happen with a <em>real</em> zener diode, where its voltage drop does change slightly with changes in current?</p>
<p>A conceptual understanding of zener diode regulator circuits is important, perhaps even more important than a quantitative understanding. Your students will need to understand what happens to the different variables in such a circuit when another parameter changes, in order to understand how these circuits will dynamically react to changing load or source conditions.</p>
