<p>A ROM memory chip is rated at 4k <span class="math"> × </span> 8 bits. What, exactly, does this designation mean? How many addresses are there inside this memory chip? How many bits of storage are there, total, in this memory chip? How many address bits are there, and how many data bits are there?</p>
<p>There are 4096 addresses inside this ROM chip, for a total of 32768 bits of data storage. This chip will have twelve address bits and eight data bits.</p>
<p>Discuss with your students why there are not 4000 (exactly) addresses in a &quot;4k&quot; memory chip.</p>
