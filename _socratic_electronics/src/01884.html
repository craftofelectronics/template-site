<p>Calculate the primary winding current (magnitude and phase angle) for this resistively loaded transformer, with a primary inductance of 18 Henrys and a secondary inductance of 36 Henrys:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01884x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Also, draw an equivalent schematic diagram (with no transformer in it) illustrating the impedance &quot;seen&quot; by the AC power source. Assume no winding resistance in either transformer winding, and a magnetic coupling coefficient between the two windings of exactly 1.</p>

<p>Follow-up question: what is the &quot;step&quot; ratio of this transformer, and is it step-up or step-down?</p>
<p>This question illustrates how reflected load impedance is &quot;seen&quot; by the source, and how it interacts with the transformerâ€™s intrinsic winding impedance.</p>
