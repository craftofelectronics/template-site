<p>Observe the following circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02025x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Note that it is not reducible to a single resistance and power source. In other words, it is <em>not</em> a series-parallel combination circuit. And, while it is a bridge circuit, you are not able to simply analyze the resistor ratios because it is obviously not in a state of balance!</p>
<p>If you were asked to calculate voltage or current for any component in this circuit, it would be a difficult task . . . unless you know either Thévenin’s or Norton’s theorems, that is!</p>
<p>Apply either one of these theorems to the determination of voltage across the 2.2 k<span class="math">Ω </span> resistor (the resistor in the upper-right corner of the bridge). Hint: consider the 2.2 k<span class="math">Ω </span> resistor as the <em>load</em> in a Thévenin or Norton equivalent circuit.</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>V</em><sub>2. 2<em>k</em>Ω </sub></span> = 5.6624 volts</p>
<p>Hint: the Thévenin equivalent circuit looks like this (with the 2.2 k<span class="math">Ω </span> resistor connected as the load):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02025x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Both Thévenin’s and Norton’s theorems are powerful circuit analysis tools, if you know how to apply them! Students often have difficulty seeing how to analyze the bridge circuit (with the &quot;load&quot; resistor removed), using series-parallel and redrawing techniques. Be prepared to help them through this step during discussion time.</p>
