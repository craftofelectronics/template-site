<p>This regulated power supply circuit has a problem. Instead of outputting 15 volts DC (exactly) as it should, it is outputting 0 volts DC to the load:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03772x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>You measure 0.25 volts DC between TP4 and ground, and 20 volts between TP1 and ground, using your voltmeter. From this information, determine at least two independent faults that could cause this particular problem.</p>
<p>(note that this list is not exhaustive)</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Opamp (<span class="math"><em>U</em><sub>1</sub></span>) failed with output saturated negative.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Zener diode (<span class="math"><em>D</em><sub>1</sub></span>) failed shorted.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> failed open.</p>
<p>Ask your students to explain their reasoning, as to why they chose the component faults that they did. Also, ask them to identify any components they think are working properly (beyond a doubt).</p>
