<p>Plot the typical response of a band-pass filter circuit, showing signal output (amplitude) on the vertical axis and frequency on the horizontal axis:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01564x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Also, identify and label the <em>bandwidth</em> of the circuit on your filter plot.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01564x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The bandwidth of a band-pass filter circuit is that range of frequencies where the output amplitude is at least 70.7% of maximum:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01564x03.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Bandwidth is an important concept in electronics, for more than just filter circuits. Your students may discover references to bandwidth of amplifiers, transmission lines, and other circuit elements as they do their research. Despite the many and varied applications of this term, the principle is fundamentally the same.</p>
