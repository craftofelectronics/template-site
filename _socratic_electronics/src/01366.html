<p>Explain how the addition of a propagation-delay-based one-shot circuit to the enable input of an S-R latch changes its behavior:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01366x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Specifically, reference your answer to a truth table for this circuit.</p>
<p>The outputs of this device are allowed to change state only when the &quot;clock&quot; signal (C) is transitioning from low to high:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01366x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Challenge question: what exactly happens in the &quot;invalid&quot; state for this S-R flip-flop?</p>
<p>Discuss with your students what happens in this circuit when the clock signal is doing anything other than transitioning from low to high. What condition(s) are equivalent in a regular S-R gated latch circuit?</p>
<p>The challenge question is especially tricky to answer. &quot;Invalid&quot; states are easy to determine in regular S-R latch circuits, gated or ungated. However, because an S-R <em>flip-flop</em> is only momentarily &quot;gated&quot; by the edge of the clock signal, the states its outputs fall to after that edge event has passed is much more difficult to determine.</p>
