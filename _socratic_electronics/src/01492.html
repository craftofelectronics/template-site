<p>Explain how it would be possible to have more than two telegraph stations working on your system. Where would you connect the third, fourth, and fifth stations? Would the station designs have to be changed in order to accommodate more than two stations? Will your working voltage have to change?</p>
<p>It is very easy to add stations if the example design is used. If other designs are chosen, it may be more difficult.</p>
<p>This question forces students to really think about how their system works, and what considerations arise when system expansion is suggested.</p>
