<p>Explain what a <em>time-delay relay</em> is, and how it functionally differs from a regular electromechanical relay.</p>
<p>A &quot;time-delay&quot; relay either waits before actuating after power-up, or waits before de-actuating after power-down.</p>
<p>The earliest time-delay relays used pneumatic &quot;dash-pot&quot; motion dampers to provide the necessary actuation or de-actuation delays. Modern time-delay relays use electronic timer circuits to do the time delay function, even when the output of the relay is still a set of mechanical contacts.</p>
