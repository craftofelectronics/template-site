<p><em>Load lines</em> are useful tools for analyzing transistor amplifier circuits, but they may be hard to understand at first. To help you understand what &quot;load lines&quot; are useful for and how they are determined, I will apply one to this simple two-resistor circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00953x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>We will have to plot a load line for this simple two-resistor circuit along with the &quot;characteristic curve&quot; for resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> in order to see the benefit of a load line. Load lines really only have meaning when superimposed with other plots. First, the characteristic curve for <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span>, defined as the voltage/current relationship between terminals <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong>:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00953x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Next, I will plot the load line as defined by the 1.5 k<span class="math">Ω </span> load resistor. This &quot;load line&quot; expresses the voltage available between the same two terminals (<span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>A</em><em>B</em></sub></span>) as a function of the load current, to account for voltage dropped across the load:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00953x03.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>At what value of current (<span class="math"><em>I</em><sub><em>R</em>1</sub></span>) do the two lines intersect? Explain what is significant about this value of current.</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>I</em><sub><em>R</em></sub></span> = 8 mA is the same value of current you would calculate if you had analyzed this circuit as a simple series resistor network.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: you might be wondering, &quot;what is the point of plotting a ’characteristic curve’ and a ’load line’ in such a simple circuit, if all we had to do to solve for current was add the two resistances and divide that total resistance value into the total voltage?&quot; Well, to be honest, there is no point in analyzing such a simple circuit in this manner, except to illustrate <em>how</em> load lines work. My follow-up question to you is this: where would plotting a load line actually be helpful in analyzing circuit behavior? Can you think of any modifications to this two-resistor circuit that would require load line analysis in order to solve for current?</p>
<p>While this approach to circuit analysis may seem silly – using load lines to calculate the current in a two-resistor circuit – it demonstrates the principle of load lines in a context that should be obvious to students at this point in their study. Discuss with your students how the two lines are obtained (one for resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> and the other plotting the voltage available to <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> based on the total source voltage and the load resistor’s value).</p>
<p>Also, discuss the significance of the two line intersecting. Mathematically, what does the intersection of two graphs mean? What do the coordinate values of the intersection point represent in a system of simultaneous functions? How does this principle relate to an electronic circuit?</p>
