<p>The circuit shown here is called an <em>S-R latch</em>:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01351x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Identify which of the two input lines is the <em>Set</em>, and which is the <em>Reset</em>, and then write a truth table describing the function of this circuit.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01351x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Follow-up question: why are the inputs referred to as <span class="math">$\overline{\hbox{Set}}$</span> and <span class="math">$\overline{\hbox{Reset}}$</span>, rather than just Set and Reset?</p>
<p>The &quot;latch&quot; state is the most interesting in this circuit. Discuss what this means with your students, especially since it is impossible to describe the &quot;latch&quot; state in terms of fixed 1’s and 0’s. Also ask your students to identify the &quot;invalid&quot; state of this latch circuit, and to explain why it is called &quot;invalid&quot;.</p>
<p>Discuss the active-low nature of this latch circuit’s inputs. Explain to your students that many digital functions have active-low inputs, and that it is common to denote those inputs by writing a Boolean complementation bar over the input’s name.</p>
