<p>Plot the equation <span class="math"><em>y</em> = <em>x</em><sup>2</sup></span> on the following graph:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03101x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>On the same graph, plot the equation <span class="math"><em>y</em> = <em>x</em> + 2</span>. What is the significance of the point where the two plots cross?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03101x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Here there are <em>two</em> points of intersection between the parabola (curve) and the straight line, representing two different solution sets that satisfy <em>both</em> equations.</p>
<p>Challenge question: solve this simultaneous system of equations without graphing, but by symbolically manipulating the equations!</p>
<p>Here, solution by graphing may be a bit easier than the symbolic solution. In principle we may determine solutions for <em>any</em> pair of equations by graphing, with about equal difficulty. The only real problem is precision: how closely we may interpret to points of intersection. A practical example of non-linear simultaneous function solution is <em>load line</em> analysis in semiconductor circuitry.</p>
