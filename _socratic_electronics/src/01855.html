<p>Note that this circuit is impossible to reduce by regular series-parallel analysis:</p>

<p>However, the Superposition Theorem makes it almost trivial to calculate all the voltage drops and currents:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01855x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Explain the procedure for applying the Superposition Theorem to this circuit.</p>
<p>This is easy enough for you to research on your own!</p>
<p>I really enjoy covering the Superposition Theorem in class with my students. Itâ€™s one of those rare analysis techniques that is intuitively obvious and yet powerful at the same time. Because the principle is so easy to learn, I highly recommend you leave this question for your students to research, and let <em>them</em> fully present the answer in class rather than you explain any of it.</p>
