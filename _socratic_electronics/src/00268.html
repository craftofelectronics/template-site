<p>Determine how much voltage a voltmeter would indicate when connected between the following points in this circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00268x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Between TB1-1 and TB1-3</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Between TB1-4 and TB2-4</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Between TB2-3 and TB2-1</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Between TB1-1 and TB2-1</p>
<p>Hint: it might help to draw a neat schematic diagram of this circuit first, with all connection points labeled!</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Between TB1-1 and TB1-3 (<em>Voltmeter measures 9 volts</em>)</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Between TB1-4 and TB2-4 (<em>Voltmeter measures 0 volts</em>)</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Between TB2-3 and TB2-1 (<em>Voltmeter measures 0 volts</em>)</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Between TB1-1 and TB2-1 (<em>Voltmeter measures 9 volts</em>)</p>
<p>This question provides an opportunity to discuss the concept of <em>electrically common points</em>: namely, that there can be no substantial voltage built up between points that are made &quot;electrically common&quot; by means of low-resistance connections between them.</p>
<p>This is also an opportunity to develop the skill of drawing a schematic diagram for a real-life circuit. Schematic diagrams, of course, are very helpful in that they provide a nice, neat layout of all circuit components, making visualization of voltage drops and other quantities easier.</p>
