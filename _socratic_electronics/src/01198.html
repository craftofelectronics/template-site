<p>Digital computers use a numeration system with a base of <em>two</em>, rather than a base of <em>ten</em> as we are accustomed to using. It is much easier to engineer circuitry that counts in &quot;binary&quot; than it is to design circuits that count in any other base system. Based on what you know of numeration systems, answer the following questions:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> How many different symbols (ciphers) are there in the binary numeration system?</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> What are the different place-weight values in the binary system?</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> How would you represent the number &quot;seventeen&quot; in binary?</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> In our base-ten (denary) numeration system, each character is called a &quot;digit.&quot; What is each character called in the binary numeration system?</p>
<p>There are only two valid ciphers in the binary system: 0 and 1. Each successive place carries twice the &quot;weight&quot; of the one before it. Seventeen = 10001 (in binary). Each character in the binary system is called a &quot;bit&quot; rather than a &quot;digit&quot;.</p>
<p>Ask your students to hypothesize why binary is used in digital circuitry rather than base-ten (denary) numeration. I’ve revealed that it’s easier to build circuits representing quantities in binary than any other numerical base, but why?</p>
