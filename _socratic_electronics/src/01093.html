<p>Some SCRs and TRIACs are advertised as <em>sensitive-gate</em> devices. What does this mean? What is the difference between a &quot;sensitive gate&quot; SCR and an SCR with a &quot;non-sensitive gate&quot;?</p>
<p>SCRs and TRIACs with &quot;sensitive gates&quot; resemble the idealized devices illustrated in textbooks. SCRs and TRIACs with &quot;non-sensitive&quot; gates are intentionally &quot;desensitized&quot; by the addition of an internal loading resistor connected to the gate terminal.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: where would this loading resistor be connected, in the following equivalent diagram for an SCR?</p>

<p>Ask your students why a thyristor such as an SCR or a TRIAC would need to be &quot;de-sensitized&quot; by the addition of a loading resistor? What is wrong with having a &quot;sensitive&quot; thyristor in a circuit?</p>
