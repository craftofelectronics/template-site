<p>This is an interesting application of a transformer:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00754x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>With this circuit, power to the AC load may be controlled by the variable resistor’s setting:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00754x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Calculate the amount of series impedance the transformer places in the load current’s path, if the variable resistor is set to a resistance of 15 ohms, and the winding ratio is 20:1.</p>
<p>0.0375 <span class="math">Ω </span></p>
<p>Follow-up question identify any potential safety hazards associated with using a transformer in this capacity.</p>
<p>Ask your students to think of a practical application for a circuit like this. Also, challenge them with this question: if the resistor were to open fully (<span class="math">∞</span> ohms), would current to the load completely stop? Why or why not?</p>
