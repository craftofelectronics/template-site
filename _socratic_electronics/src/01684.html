<p>By the word <em>overtone</em>, I imply the musical concept: the successive harmonics appearing in this particular non-sinusoidal waveform. If I were to say &quot;1st harmonic,&quot; &quot;2nd harmonic,&quot; and &quot;3rd harmonic,&quot; this would specifically refer to <span class="math"><em>f</em><sub><em>f</em><em>u</em><em>n</em><em>d</em><em>a</em><em>m</em><em>e</em><em>n</em><em>t</em><em>a</em><em>l</em></sub></span>, <span class="math">2<em>f</em><sub><em>f</em><em>u</em><em>n</em><em>d</em><em>a</em><em>m</em><em>e</em><em>n</em><em>t</em><em>a</em><em>l</em></sub></span>, and <span class="math">3<em>f</em><sub><em>f</em><em>u</em><em>n</em><em>d</em><em>a</em><em>m</em><em>e</em><em>n</em><em>t</em><em>a</em><em>l</em></sub></span>, respectively. The first of these would be given, the second nonexistent in a square wave with 50% duty cycle, leaving only the third as something to actually predict and measure. By &quot;overtones,&quot; I mean the first, second, and third frequencies greater than the fundamental frequency found in a square wave, that happen to be harmonics of the fundamental.</p>
<p>If you lack a spectrum analyzer in your lab, fear not! There are free software packages in existence allowing you to use the audio input of a personal computer’s sound card as a (limited) spectrum analyzer and oscilloscope! You may find some of these packages by searching on the Internet. One that I’ve used (2002) successfully in my own class is called WinScope.</p>
