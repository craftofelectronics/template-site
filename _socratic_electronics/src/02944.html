<p>A <em>sequential</em> timer circuit may be constructed from multiple 555 timer ICs cascaded together. Examine this circuit and determine how it works:</p>

<p>Can you think of any practical applications for a circuit such as this?</p>
<p>Each 555 timerâ€™s cycle is triggered by the negative edge of the pulse on the <em>trigger</em> terminal. A passive differentiator network between each 555 timer ensures that only a brief negative-going pulse is sent to the trigger terminal of the next timer from the output terminal of the one before it.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: when timer circuits are cascaded like this, do their time delays <em>add</em> or <em>multiply</em> to make the total delay time? Be sure to explain your reasoning.</p>
<p>Practical applications abound for such a circuit. One whimsical application is to energize sequential tail-light bulbs for an automobile, to give an interesting turn-signal visual effect. A sequential timer circuit was used to do just this on certain years of (classic) Ford Cougar cars. Other, more utilitarian, applications for sequential timers include start-up sequences for a variety of electronic systems, traffic light controls, and automated household appliances.</p>
