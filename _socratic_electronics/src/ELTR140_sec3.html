<p>The purpose of using Gray code instead of binary encoding on rotary encoder wheels is a difficult concept for some to grasp. One aid I have found in explaining the need for Gray encoding is to build an actual rotary encoder wheel out of a piece of stiff card-stock paper, drawing the code bits on the wheel as semi-circular arcs. By rotating this wheel and looking at the bits go by, you can better see what problems may result if the bit sensors were out of alignment.</p>
<p>When we represent numbers in binary (or any other numeration system, for that matter!) given a fixed number of characters, we become bound to a certain range of representable numbers. A 10-digit electronic calculator lacking powers-of-ten notation, for example, can only display numbers from -9,999,999,999 to +9,999,999,999. Any attempt to calculate answers beyond this range will result in <em>overflow</em>, as the digital circuit will not be able to represent the result. It is important for students to comprehend and respect the concept of overflow, because it allows intelligent interpretation of digital calculation results. It is necessary for a digital circuit to be able to detect this condition, so that the answer may be flagged as incorrect, rather than have the answer be presented as valid.</p>
