<p>An automotive engineer wants to design a logic circuit that prohibits the engine in a car from being started unless the driver is pressing the clutch pedal while turning the ignition switch to the &quot;start&quot; position. The purpose of this feature will be to prevent the car from moving forward while being started if ever the transmission is accidently left in gear.</p>
<p>Suppose we designate the status of the ignition switch &quot;start&quot; position with the Boolean variable <span class="math"><em>S</em></span> (1 = start; 0 = run or off), and the clutch pedal position with the Boolean variable <span class="math"><em>C</em></span> (1 = clutch pedal depressed; 0 = clutch pedal in normal, unpressed position). Write a Boolean expression for the starter solenoid status, given the start switch (<span class="math"><em>S</em></span>) and clutch (<span class="math"><em>C</em></span>) statuses. Then, draw a logic gate circuit to implement this Boolean function.</p>
<p>Boolean expression:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math"><em>S</em><em>C</em></span><br /></p>
<p>Logic gate circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02796x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>This is not a very complicated function to express or implement, the point of this question being mostly to introduce students to a practical use of logic gates and Boolean algebra.</p>
