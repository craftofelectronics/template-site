<p>Identify which of these components are connected directly in series with each other, and which are connected directly in parallel with each other:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01753x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Assume that the open wire ends are connection points to a power source. In circuits where ground symbols appear, consider ground as the other side of the power source.</p>
<p>R1 in series with SW1.</p>
<p>R1 in series with R2; R3 in parallel with R4.</p>
<p>R1 parallel with R2.</p>
<p>R1 parallel with R2.</p>
<p>L1 in series with C1.</p>
<p>R3 in parallel with R4.</p>
<p>Challenge question: if you compare figures 2 and 6, you see how merely changing the location(s) where the power supply connects to the network can alter the series/parallel relationships of the components. But, exactly what is it that is altered? If two components are in series with each other in one power source configuration, can that series relationship change by moving the power supply connection points? How about parallel connections? If two components are in parallel with each other, can that parallel relationship become altered merely by moving the points where the power source connects to the network? Explain.</p>
<p>Work with your students to clearly identify rules by which series and parallel connections may be identified. This is extremely important for students to grasp if they are to be successful analyzing series-parallel networks of any kind. The most common problems I encounter as an electronics instructor with reference to series-parallel are invariably related to studentsâ€™ lack of ability to consistently distinguish series sub-networks and parallel sub-networks in series-parallel combination circuits.</p>
