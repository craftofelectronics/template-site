<p>The answer to this question is fairly trivial, but the real point of it is to get students thinking about how and why it is the way it is. One thing I’ve noticed as an instructor of electronics is that most students tend to follow the rule of proximity: the resistor’s voltage drop polarity is determined by proximity to poles of the battery. The resistor terminal closest to the battery’s negative terminal must be negative as well, or so the thinking goes. While this is sound reasoning in a simple circuit such as this, it can lead to confusion in circuits where there is more than one power source at work!</p>
