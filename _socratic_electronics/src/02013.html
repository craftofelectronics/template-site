<p>What does it mean if a power supply has a DC output with 5% ripple?</p>
<p>This means the peak-to-peak ripple voltage is equal to 5% of the DC (average) voltage.</p>
<p>The purpose of this question is to get students to look up the formula for calculating ripple voltage percentage. Notice how I did not simply ask them to regurgitate a formula; rather, I presented a realistic figure for them to interpret. When at all possible, try to format your questions in this sort of practical context!</p>
