<p>Calculate the total voltage of these series-connected voltage sources:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00492x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>This is a &quot;trick&quot; question, because only the total voltage of the DC sources may be predicted with certainty. There is insufficient information to calculate the total AC voltage for the two series-connected AC sources!</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00492x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Discuss with your students exactly why the total voltage of the two series-connected AC sources cannot be determined, given the little information we have about them. Is it possible for their total voltage to be 8 VAC, just like the series-aiding DC sources? Is it possible for their total voltage to be 2 VAC, just like the series-opposing DC sources? Why or why not?</p>
