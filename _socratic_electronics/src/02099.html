<p>When drawing phasor diagrams, there is a standardized orientation for all angles used to ensure consistency between diagrams. This orientation is usually referenced to a set of perpendicular lines, like the <span class="math"><em>x</em></span> and <span class="math"><em>y</em></span> axes commonly seen when graphing algebraic functions:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02099x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The intersection of the two axes is called the <em>origin</em>, and straight horizontal to the right is the definition of zero degrees (0<span class="math">$^{o}$</span>). Thus, a phasor with a magnitude of 6 and an angle of 0<span class="math">$^{o}$</span> would look like this on the diagram:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02099x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Draw a phasor with a magnitude of 10 and an angle of 100 degrees on the above diagram, as well as a phasor with a magnitude of 2 and an angle of -45 degrees. Label what directions 90<span class="math">$^{o}$</span>, 180<span class="math">$^{o}$</span>, and 270<span class="math">$^{o}$</span> would indicate on the same diagram.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02099x03.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Graph paper, a ruler, and a protractor may be helpful for your students as they begin to draw and interpret phasor diagrams. Even if they have no prior knowledge of trigonometry or phasors, they should still be able to graphically represent simple phasor systems and even solve for resultant phasors.</p>
