<p>When transmitting audio information (such as music and speech) in the form of radio waves, why bother modulating a high-frequency carrier signal? Why not just connect a powerful audio amplifier straight to an antenna and broadcast the audio frequencies directly?</p>
<p>There are several reasons you would <em>not</em> want to try to broadcast electromagnetic (radio) waves at audio frequencies. A few of the most important are listed here:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> The necessary size of the antenna.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Low transmission efficiency from inability to match antenna length to (changing) audio frequency.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Interference from other (similar) radio transmitters.</p>
<p>Be prepared to explain <em>why</em> each of these factors effectively prohibits radio broadcasts at audio frequencies.</p>
<p>The purpose of this question is to have students relate their understanding of basic RF and antenna theory to a very practical problem of broadcasting low-frequency (in this case, audio) information. A fun exercise to do along with this question is to calculate the necessary physical dimensions of a quarter-wave (<span class="math">$\lambda \over 4$</span>) antenna at a frequency of 2 kHz, keeping in mind that <span class="math">$\lambda = {v \over f}$</span> and <span class="math"><em>v</em> ≈ 3 × 10<sup>8</sup></span> meters per second.</p>
