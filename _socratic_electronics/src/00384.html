<p>If the ends of a wire loop are attached to two half-circular metal strips, arranged so that the two strips almost form a complete circle, and those strips are contacted by two &quot;brushes&quot; which connect to opposite poles of a battery, which way will the wire loop rotate?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00384x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Clockwise, continuously.</p>
<p>Challenge your students with this question: is there any way we can get the wire loop to continuously rotate without using those half-circle metal strips to make and break contact with the battery? Ask your students what the two half-circle metal strips are called, in electric motor/generator terminology.</p>
