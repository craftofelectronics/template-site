<p>Calculus is a branch of mathematics that originated with scientific questions concerning <em>rates of change</em>. The easiest rates of change for most people to understand are those dealing with time. For example, a student watching their savings account dwindle over time as they pay for tuition and other expenses is very concerned with rates of change (<em>dollars per year</em> being spent).</p>
<p>In calculus, we have a special word to describe rates of change: <em>derivative</em>. One of the notations used to express a derivative (rate of change) appears as a fraction. For example, if the variable <span class="math"><em>S</em></span> represents the amount of money in the student’s savings account and <span class="math"><em>t</em></span> represents time, the rate of change of dollars over time would be written like this:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">${dS \over dt}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The following set of figures puts actual numbers to this hypothetical scenario:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Date: November 20</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Saving account balance (<span class="math"><em>S</em></span>) = $12,527.33</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Rate of spending <span class="math">$\left({dS \over dt}\right)$</span> = -5,749.01 per year</p>
<p>List some of the equations you have seen in your study of electronics containing derivatives, and explain how <em>rate of change</em> relates to the real-life phenomena described by those equations.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$i = C {dv \over dt}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$v = L {di \over dt}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$v = N {d \phi \over dt}$</span><br /></p>
<p>I leave it to you to describe how the rate-of-change over time of one variable relates to the other variables in each of the scenarios described by these equations.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: why is the derivative quantity in the student’s savings account example expressed as a negative number? What would a positive <span class="math">$dS \over dt$</span> represent in real life?</p>
<p>Challenge question: describe actual circuits you could build to demonstrate each of these equations, so that others could see what it means for one variable’s rate-of-change over time to affect another variable.</p>
<p>The purpose of this question is to introduce the concept of the derivative to students in ways that are familiar to them. Hopefully the opening scenario of a dwindling savings account is something they can relate to!</p>
<p>A very important aspect of this question is the discussion it will engender between you and your students regarding the relationship between rates of change in the three equations given in the answer. It is very important to your students’ comprehension of this concept to be able to verbally describe how the derivative works in each of these formulae. You may want to have them phrase their responses in realistic terms, as if they were describing how to set up an illustrative experiment for a classroom demonstration.</p>
