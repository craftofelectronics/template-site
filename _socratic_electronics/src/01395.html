<p>Audio headphones make highly sensitive voltage detectors for AC signals in the audio frequency range. However, the small speakers inside headphones are quite easily damaged by the application of DC voltage.</p>
<p>Explain how a capacitor could be used as a &quot;filtering&quot; device to allow AC signals through to a pair of headphones, yet block any applied DC voltage, so as to help prevent accidental damage of the headphones while using them as an electrical instrument.</p>
<p>The key to understanding how to answer this question is to recognize what a capacitor &quot;appears as&quot; to AC signals versus DC signals.</p>
<p>Connect a capacitor in series with the headphone speakers.</p>
<p>I highly recommend to students that they should build a transformer-isolation circuit if they intend to use a pair of audio headphones as a test device (see question file number 00983 for a complete schematic diagram).</p>
