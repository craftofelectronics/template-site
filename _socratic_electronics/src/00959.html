<p>Explain the effects of increasing the load resistance in this amplifier circuit. As the load becomes more resistive, will the input signal (<span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>i</em><em>n</em></sub></span>) have more or less effect on the output voltage (<span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>o</em><em>u</em><em>t</em></sub></span>) than before? Express your answer in terms of voltage gain (<span class="math"><em>A</em><sub><em>V</em></sub></span>).</p>

<p>As the load resistor increases in value, the voltage gain of the amplifier will increase.</p>
<p>Ask your students to imagine two scenarios of extreme resistance change for R3: shorted and open. Does this &quot;thought experiment&quot; help to see the effects of changing load resistance? If not, imagine two (lesser) extreme load resistance values: 1 ohm versus 1 million ohms. Now is the effect of load resistance change apparent?</p>
<p>Another question to provoke deep thought about this circuit is to ask what the effects of load resistance change will be on this circuitâ€™s load line. Does a greater load resistance make for a steeper load line, or a shallower load line? How does this relate to voltage gain?</p>
