<p>Calculate the approximate amount of current this current mirror circuit will try to maintain through <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>l</em><em>o</em><em>a</em><em>d</em></sub></span>, assuming silicon transistors (0.7 volts forward base-emitter junction drop):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02434x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Also, calculate the approximate power dissipation of both transistors.</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>I</em><sub><em>l</em><em>o</em><em>a</em><em>d</em></sub> ≈ </span> 8.63 mA <span class="math"><em>P</em><sub><em>Q</em>1</sub> ≈ </span> 6.041 mW <span class="math"><em>P</em><sub><em>Q</em>2</sub> ≈ </span> 95.41 mW</p>
<p>Follow-up question: what do the two power dissipation figures tell us about the relative power of two transistors handling the exact same currents? Explain why this is important in a current mirror circuit, and why it is customary to thermally bond <span class="math"><em>Q</em><sub>1</sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>Q</em><sub>2</sub></span> together in discrete-component current mirrors.</p>
<p>Ask your students to explain how they obtained the answer to this question, step by step.</p>
<p>The follow-up question is an important one for a few reasons. First, students must be aware that transistor power dissipation is determined by more than just collector current. Secondly, the disparate dissipations of these two transistors will lead to inaccuracies in regulated current in a current mirror circuit if measures are not taken to equalize their temperatures.</p>
