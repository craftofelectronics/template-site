<p>Although the <em>toggle</em> function of the J-K flip-flop is one of its most popular uses, this is not the only type of flip-flop capable of performing a toggle function. Behold the surprisingly versatile D-type flip-flop configured to do the same thing:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03453x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Explain how this circuit performs the &quot;toggle&quot; function more commonly associated with J-K flip-flops.</p>
<p>At each clock pulse, the flip-flop must switch to the opposite state because D receives inverted feedback from <span class="math">$\overline{Q}$</span>.</p>
<p>The main purpose of this question is to get students to see that toggling is not the exclusive domain of J-K flip-flops. This fact may be particularly handy to know if one needs a toggle function in a circuit but only has a D-type flip-flop available, not a J-K flip-flop.</p>
