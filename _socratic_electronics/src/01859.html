<p>Explain what a <em>band-pass</em> filter is, and how it differs from either a low-pass or a high-pass filter circuit. Also, explain what a <em>band-stop</em> filter is, and draw Bode plots representative of both band-pass and band-stop filter types.</p>
<p>A band-pass filter passes only those frequencies falling within a specified range, or &quot;band.&quot; A band-stop filter, sometimes referred to as a <em>notch filter</em>, does just the opposite: it attenuates frequencies falling within a specified band.</p>
<p>Challenge question: what type of filter, band-pass or band-stop, do you suppose is used in a radio receiver (tuner)? Explain your reasoning.</p>
<p>In this question, Iâ€™ve opted to let students draw Bode plots, only giving them written descriptions of each filter type.</p>
