<p>Determine the amount of electrical resistance indicated by an ohmmeter connected between the following points in this circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01601x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Between points A and B =</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Between points A and C =</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Between points C and D =</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Between points D and B =</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Between points B and C =</p>
<p>Explain whether or not it makes any sense to speak of a &quot;total&quot; resistance for this network.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Between points A and B = 2.41 k<span class="math">Ω </span></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Between points A and C = 2.89 k<span class="math">Ω </span></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Between points C and D = 1.32 k<span class="math">Ω </span></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Between points D and B = 2.10 k<span class="math">Ω </span></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Between points B and C = 2.75 k<span class="math">Ω </span></p>
<p>The purpose of this question is to get students to realize that the resistance &quot;looking into&quot; different areas of a resistive network depends on what those areas are.</p>
