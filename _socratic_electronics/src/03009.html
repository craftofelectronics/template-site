<p>Use circuit simulation software to verify your predicted and actual truth tables.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the input states in this circuit are defined by the voltage levels, not by the contact status. In other words, a closed contact equals a &quot;low&quot; (0) logic state.</p>
<p>Here, the arrangement of the input letters D, C, B, and A is purposeful: D represents the most significant bit, while A represents the least significant bit, just like the IC datasheets typically order the input lines.</p>
<p>Normally, I draw LEDs in the schematic to give visual indication of output states. Here, due to the sheer number of required LEDs (16), I decided not to. However, students with access to lots of LEDs may choose to add them to their circuits, because visual indicators do make the circuitâ€™s function easier to understand.</p>
<p>If the decoder IC has enable inputs, the students must figure out what to do with them to make the circuit function!</p>
