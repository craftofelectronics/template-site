<p>Explain what will happen to the magnetized rotor when 3-phase AC power is applied to the stationary electromagnet coils:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00738x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The magnetic rotor will rotate as it tries to orient itself with the rotating magnetic field.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: what must we do with the AC power energizing the coils to increase the rotorâ€™s rotational speed?</p>
<p>Here, we see a practical 3-phase electric motor. Be sure to thoroughly discuss what is necessary to increase or decrease rotor speed, and compare this with what is necessary to increase or decrease speed in a DC motor.</p>
