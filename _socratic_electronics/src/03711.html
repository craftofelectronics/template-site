<p>Predict how all three transistor currents (<span class="math"><em>I</em><sub><em>B</em></sub></span>, <span class="math"><em>I</em><sub><em>C</em></sub></span>, and <span class="math"><em>I</em><sub><em>E</em></sub></span>) will be affected as a result of the following faults. Consider each fault independently (i.e. one at a time, no multiple faults):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03711x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Base resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>B</em></sub></span> fails open:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Collector resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>C</em></sub></span> fails open:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Solder bridge (short) past base resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>B</em></sub></span>:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Solder bridge (short) past collector resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>C</em></sub></span>:</p>
<p>For each of these conditions, explain <em>why</em> the resulting effects will occur.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Base resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>B</em></sub></span> fails open: <em>All three currents stop.</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Collector resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>C</em></sub></span> fails open: <em>Base current unchanged, collector current stops, emitter current decreases to value of base current (<span class="math"><em>I</em><sub><em>E</em></sub> = <em>I</em><sub><em>B</em></sub></span>).</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Solder bridge (short) past base resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>B</em></sub></span>: <em>All three currents greatly increase, transistor will likely overheat and fail.</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Solder bridge (short) past collector resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>C</em></sub></span>: <em>Base current unchanged, collector current increases slightly (ideally will not change at all!), transistor dissipates more power in the form of heat (may overheat).</em>:</p>
<p>The purpose of this question is to approach the domain of circuit troubleshooting from a perspective of knowing what the fault is, rather than only knowing what the symptoms are. Although this is not necessarily a realistic perspective, it helps students build the foundational knowledge necessary to diagnose a faulted circuit from empirical data. Questions such as this should be followed (eventually) by other questions asking students to identify likely faults based on measurements.</p>
