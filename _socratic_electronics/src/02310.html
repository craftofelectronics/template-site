<p>Explain why the wave-shape of the excitation voltage is irrelevant to the operation of this curve tracing circuit. The transformer happens to output the same sine wave shape exhibited by the AC line power, but the circuit would work equally wall with a triangle wave, sawtooth wave, or badly distorted sine wave.</p>
<p>All that is needed is some sort of wave-shape that sweeps the oscilloscope beam to and fro. Since the relationship between vertical displacement and horizontal displacement on the oscilloscope’s trace is purely a function of the test component’s characteristic curve, we really don’t care what form of AC voltage excites it.</p>
<p>Dedicated curve tracer circuits typically use a sawtooth waveform (much like the waveform used to sweep an oscilloscope beam horizontally in the normal &quot;time-domain&quot; mode), so that the brightness of the trace is relatively even throughout. This is why a square-wave excitation would <em>not</em> work well: most of the trace would be extremely dim and hard to see, with the endpoints of the curve being the only bright spots!</p>
