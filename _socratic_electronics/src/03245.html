<p>Paramedics and other emergency medical personnel sometimes use a machine called a <em>defibrillator</em> to re-start the regular heart-beat of a person whose heart has stopped or is spastically convulsing (fibrillating). Explain what this machine does to &quot;restart&quot; a person’s heart.</p>
<p>A defibrillator machine sends a powerful surge of electric current through the victim’s chest to force his or her heart muscles to contract.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: explain how this principle is similar to that of an electric stun-gun (&quot;TASER&quot;) or other high-voltage, non-lethal weapon to immobilize a person. How does a defibrillator’s function differ from that of a stun-gun?</p>
<p>This question is intended to start a lively and active discussion on the effects of electric current on human muscle and nerve tissue. Students are likely to come up with all sorts of interesting questions about defibrillators and stun-guns, so be sure to do your own research in preparation for posing this question to them?</p>
