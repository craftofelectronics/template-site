<p>Identify the method of electrical braking used in this motor control circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00698x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>This circuit provides <em>dynamic</em> braking.</p>
<p>It is apparent from the schematic diagram that the motorâ€™s field winding continues to receive power when the switch is in the &quot;brake&quot; position. Ask the students why this is necessary for dynamic braking to work. Ask them what would happen if the field winding were de-energized as well as the armature, as the switch moved to the &quot;brake&quot; position.</p>
