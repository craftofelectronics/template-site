<p>A common instrument used for measuring high AC currents in power systems is a <em>current transformer</em>, abbreviated &quot;CT&quot;. Current transformers usually take the form of a &quot;donut,&quot; through which the current-carrying conductor passes:</p>

<p>The purpose of a current transformer is to create a secondary current that is a precise fraction of the primary current, for easier measurement of current in the power conductor.</p>
<p>Given this function, would current transformers be considered a &quot;step-up&quot; or &quot;step-down&quot; transformer? Also, draw how the secondary windings of a current transformer are arranged around its toroidal core.</p>
<p>From the perspective of voltage, which is usually how the terms &quot;step-up&quot; and &quot;step-down&quot; are referenced, a current transformer is a &quot;step-up&quot; transformer. Its secondary windings are wound perpendicular to the magnetic flux path, as typical in all transformers.</p>
<p>The question of whether the current transformer is a &quot;step-down&quot; or &quot;step-up&quot; has an important safety implication for students to realize. Ask your students to describe what conditions might prove the most dangerous when working around current transformers, given their &quot;step-up&quot; nature with reference to voltage.</p>
