<p>Predict how all component voltages and currents in this circuit will be affected as a result of the following faults. Consider each fault independently (i.e. one at a time, no multiple faults):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03936x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Voltage source <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub>1</sub></span> fails with increased output:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> fails open:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>3</sub></span> fails open:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Solder bridge (short) across resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span>:</p>
<p>For each of these conditions, explain <em>why</em> the resulting effects will occur.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Voltage source <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub>1</sub></span> fails with increased output: <em>All resistor currents increase, all resistor voltages increase, current through <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub>1</sub></span> increases.</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> fails open: <em>All resistor voltages remain unchanged, current through <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> decreases to zero, currents through <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>3</sub></span> remain unchanged, current through <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub>1</sub></span> decreases by the amount that used to go through <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span>.</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>3</sub></span> fails open: <em>All resistor voltages remain unchanged, current through <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>3</sub></span> decreases to zero, currents through <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span> remain unchanged, current through <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub>1</sub></span> decreases by the amount that used to go through <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>3</sub></span>.</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Solder bridge (short) across resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span>: <em>Theoretically, all resistor voltages remain unchanged while a near-infinite amount of current goes through the shorted <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span>.

<p>The purpose of this question is to approach the domain of circuit troubleshooting from a perspective of knowing what the fault is, rather than only knowing what the symptoms are. Although this is not necessarily a realistic perspective, it helps students build the foundational knowledge necessary to diagnose a faulted circuit from empirical data. Questions such as this should be followed (eventually) by other questions asking students to identify likely faults based on measurements.</p>
