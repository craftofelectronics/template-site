<p>Use circuit simulation software to verify your predicted and measured parameter values.</p>
<p>Use a variable-voltage, regulated power supply to supply any amount of DC voltage below 30 volts. Specify standard resistor values, all between 1 k<span class="math">Ω </span> and 100 k<span class="math">Ω </span> (1k5, 2k2, 2k7, 3k3, 4k7, 5k1, 6k8, 10k, 22k, 33k, 39k 47k, 68k, etc.). Use a sine-wave function generator to supply an audio-frequency input signal, and make sure its amplitude isn’t set so high that the amplifier clips.</p>
<p>The voltage gain of this amplifier configuration tends to be very high, approximately equal to <span class="math">$R_C \over r'_e$</span>. Your students will have to use fairly low input voltages to achieve class A operation with this amplifier circuit. I have had good success using the following values:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>C</em><em>C</em></sub></span> = 12 volts</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>i</em><em>n</em></sub></span> = 20 mV peak-to-peak, at 5 kHz</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> = 1 k<span class="math">Ω </span></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span> = 4.7 k<span class="math">Ω </span></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>C</em></sub></span> = 100 <span class="math">Ω </span></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>E</em></sub></span> = 1 k<span class="math">Ω </span></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math"><em>C</em><sub>1</sub></span> = 33 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>F</p>
<p>Your students will find the actual voltage gain deviates somewhat from predicted values with this circuit, largely because it is so dependent on the value of <span class="math"><em>r</em>ʹ<sub><em>e</em></sub></span>, and that parameter tends to be unpredictable.</p>
<p>An extension of this exercise is to incorporate troubleshooting questions. Whether using this exercise as a performance assessment or simply as a concept-building lab, you might want to follow up your students’ results by asking them to predict the consequences of certain circuit faults.</p>
