<p>Draw a schematic diagram showing a potentiometer being used as a simple variable resistor for varying current to a light bulb. Also, designate which way the &quot;wiper&quot; should be moved to make the bulb glow brighter.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00324x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Make note of the fact that only two of the potentiometerâ€™s three terminals need be used if a simple variable resistor is desired.</p>
