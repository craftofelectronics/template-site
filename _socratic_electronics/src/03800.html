<p>Suppose this LC oscillator stopped working, and you suspected either the capacitor or the inductor as having failed. How could you check these two components <em>without</em> the use of an LCR meter?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03800x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Try using an ohmmeter on each component, removed from the circuit. The capacitor should read &quot;open&quot; and the inductor should read a low resistance, if both are in good condition.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: is an ohmmeter test comprehensive enough to detect all possible faults with these two types of components? Why or why not? Be as specific as you can in your answer(s).</p>
<p>Knowing how to check the condition of components with primitive test equipment is a valuable skill. It is well worth your time to discuss this question (and its answers) with your students in detail, so they all understand the concepts involved.</p>
