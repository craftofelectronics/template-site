<p>A 470 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>F capacitor is subjected to an applied voltage that changes at a rate of 200 volts per second. How much current will there be &quot;through&quot; this capacitor?</p>
<p>Explain why I placed quotation marks around the word &quot;through&quot; in the previous sentence. Why can’t this word be used in its fullest sense when describing electric current in a capacitor circuit?</p>
<p>This capacitor will have a constant current of 94 milliamps (mA) going &quot;through&quot; it. The word &quot;through&quot; is placed in quotation marks because capacitors have no continuity.</p>
<p>Don’t give your students the equation with which to perform this calculation! Let them find it on their own. The <span class="math">${dv \over dt}$</span> notation may be foreign to students lacking a strong mathematical background, but don’t let this be an obstacle to learning! Rather, use this as a way to introduce those students to the concept of <em>rates of change</em>, and to the calculus concept of the <em>derivative</em>.</p>
