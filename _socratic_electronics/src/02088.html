<p>A series AC circuit exhibits a total impedance of 10 k<span class="math">Ω </span>, with a phase shift of 65 degrees between voltage and current. Drawn in an impedance triangle, it looks like this:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02088x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>We know that the <em>sine</em> function relates the sides <span class="math"><em>X</em></span> and <span class="math"><em>Z</em></span> of this impedance triangle with the 65 degree angle, because the sine of an angle is the ratio of <em>opposite</em> to <em>hypotenuse</em>, with <span class="math"><em>X</em></span> being opposite the 65 degree angle. Therefore, we know we can set up the following equation relating these quantities together:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\sin 65^o = {X \over Z}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Solve this equation for the value of <span class="math"><em>X</em></span>, in ohms.</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>X</em></span> = 9.063 k<span class="math">Ω </span></p>
<p>Ask your students to show you their algebraic manipulation(s) in setting up the equation for evaluation.</p>
