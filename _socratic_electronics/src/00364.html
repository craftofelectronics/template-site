<p>Old vacuum-tube based electronic circuits often required several different voltage levels for proper operation. An easy way to obtain these different power supply voltages was to take a single, high-voltage power supply circuit and &quot;divide&quot; the total voltage into smaller divisions.</p>
<p>These voltage divider circuits also made provision for a small amount of &quot;wasted&quot; current through the divider called a <em>bleeder</em> current, designed to discharge the high voltage output of the power supply quickly when it was turned off.</p>
<p>Design a high-voltage divider to provide the following loads with their necessary voltages, plus a &quot;bleeder&quot; current of 5 mA (the amount of current going through resistor R4):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00364x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub> = </span> 3.25 k<span class="math">Ω </span></p>
<p><span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub> = </span> 11 k<span class="math">Ω </span></p>
<p><span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>3</sub> = </span> 3.67 k<span class="math">Ω </span></p>
<p><span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>4</sub> = </span> 9 k<span class="math">Ω </span></p>
<p>Follow-up question: how would the various output voltages (plate, screen, preamp, etc.) be affected if the bleeder resistor were to fail open? You don’t need to calculate anything, but just give a qualitative answer.</p>
<p>Be sure to ask your students <em>how</em> they obtained the solution to this problem. If no one was able to arrive at a solution, then present the following technique: simplify the problem (fewer resistors, perhaps) until the solution is obvious, then apply the same strategy you used to solve the obvious problem to the more complex versions of the problem, until you have solved the original problem in all its complexity.</p>
