<p>The circuit shown here is called a <em>relaxation oscillator</em>. It works on the principles of capacitor charging over time (an RC circuit), and of the <em>hysteresis</em> of a gas-discharge bulb: the fact that the voltage required to initiate conduction through the bulb is significantly greater than the voltage below which the bulb ceases to conduct current.</p>
<p>In this circuit, the neon bulb ionizes at a voltage of 70 volts, and stops conducting when the voltage falls below 30 volts:</p>

<p>Graph the capacitor’s voltage over time as this circuit is energized by the DC source. Note on your graph at what times the neon bulb is lit:</p>

<p>Follow-up question: assuming a source voltage of 100 volts, a resistor value of 27 k<span class="math">Ω </span>, and a capacitor value of 22 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>F, calculate the amount of time it takes for the capacitor to charge from 30 volts to 70 volts (assuming the neon bulb draws negligible current during the charging phase).</p>
<p>What we have here is a very simple strobe light circuit. This circuit may be constructed in the classroom with minimal safety hazard if the DC voltage source is a hand-crank generator instead of a battery bank or line-powered supply. I’ve demonstrated this in my own classroom before, using a hand-crank &quot;Megger&quot; (high-range, high-voltage ohmmeter) as the power source.</p>
