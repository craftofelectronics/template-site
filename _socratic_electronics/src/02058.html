<p>From the &quot;diode check&quot; measurements taken with these two meters, identify the terminals on this JFET, and also what type of JFET it is (N-channel or P-channel):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02058x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The left-most terminal on this JFET is the gate, and the other two are source and drain. This is a P-channel JFET.</p>
<p>Ask your students to explain why the gate-channel junction registers a voltage drop of 0.743 volts, while the source-drain path only registers 15 millivolts of drop. What does this indicate about the conductivity of JFET compared to that of a BJT? Also, what does this suggest about the minimum source-drain voltage necessary for controlled current to go through the JFET?</p>
