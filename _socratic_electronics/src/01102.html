<p>The schematic diagram shown here is for a <em>&quot;buck&quot; converter circuit</em>, a type of DC-DC &quot;switching&quot; power conversion circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01102x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>In this circuit, the transistor is either fully on or fully off; that is, driven between the extremes of saturation or cutoff. By avoiding the transistor’s &quot;active&quot; mode (where it would drop substantial voltage while conducting current), very low transistor power dissipations can be achieved. With little power wasted in the form of heat, &quot;switching&quot; power conversion circuits are typically very efficient.</p>
<p>Trace all current directions during both states of the transistor. Also, mark the inductor’s voltage polarity during both states of the transistor.</p>

<p>Follow-up question: how does the load voltage of this converter relate to the supply (battery) voltage? Does the load receive more or less voltage than that provided by the battery?</p>
<p>Challenge question: why do you suppose a Schottky diode is used in this circuit, as opposed to a regular (PN) rectifying diode?</p>
<p>Ask your students why they think this circuit is called a <em>buck</em> converter. &quot;Buck&quot; usually refers to something that is in opposition. What is being opposed in this circuit?</p>
