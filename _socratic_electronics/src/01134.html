<p>A special type of insulated-gate field-effect transistor is the <em>dual gate MOSFET</em>, shown here:</p>

<p>Draw a schematic diagram using normal (single-gate) MOSFETs, equivalent to this dual-gate MOSFET.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01134x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>A pretty simple answer to this question, but the real purpose is to challenge students to think of complex circuit elements in terms of <em>equivalent circuits</em> comprised of simple, idealized components.</p>
