<p>What do each of the oscilloscope axes represent, in real-life terms (variables and units) when used in conjunction with this curve tracer circuit?</p>
<p>Horizontal axis: voltage applied across terminals of device under test (1 volt displayed = 1 volt).</p>
<p>Vertical axis: current through device under test (1 volt displayed = 1 mA)</p>
<p>The resistor’s specified value of 1 k<span class="math">Ω </span> should make perfect sense when students see the voltage:current ratio for the vertical axis!</p>
