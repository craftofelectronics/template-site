<p>Explain how the microphone in your amplifier works. How, exactly, does it convert waves of air pressure (sound) into electrical signals?</p>
<p>The answer to this question depends on what type of microphone you use:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Condenser: variable capacitance</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Dynamic: electromagnetic induction</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Crystal: piezoelectricity</p>
<p>Microphones are important devices in the world of electronics, and students are likely to appreciate their function more when building a project that uses one.</p>
