<p>Describe what <em>electrical conduit</em> is, and what applications it is commonly used in. Contrast &quot;conduit&quot; against <em>raceways</em> and <em>wire trays</em>.</p>
<p>&quot;Conduit&quot; is large-diameter metal tubing used as pathways for electrical wires and cables.</p>
<p>If you happen to have pieces of conduit available for demonstration, show them to your students during discussion time. Better yet, take them to a place where they can see electrical conduit in use!</p>
<p>Be sure to ask them questions about the other methods (raceways, wire trays) of laying wire, and how these methods compare with rigid conduit.</p>
