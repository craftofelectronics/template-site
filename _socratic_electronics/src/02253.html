<p>A very important concept in electronics is that of <em>negative feedback</em>. This is an extremely important concept to grasp, as a great many electronic systems exploit this principle for their operation and cannot be properly understood without a comprehension of it.</p>
<p>However important negative feedback might be, it is not the easiest concept to understand. In fact, it is quite a conceptual leap for some. The following is a list of examples – some electronic, some not – exhibiting negative feedback:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> A voltage regulating circuit</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> An auto-pilot system for an aircraft or boat</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> A thermostatic temperature control system (&quot;thermostat&quot;)</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Emitter resistor in a BJT amplifier circuit</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Lenz’s Law demonstration (magnetic damping of a moving object)</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Body temperature of a mammal</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Natural regulation of prices in a free market economy (Adam Smith’s &quot;invisible hand&quot;)</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> A scientist learning about the behavior of a natural system through experimentation.</p>
<p>For each case, answer the following questions:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> What variable is being stabilized by negative feedback?</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> How is the feedback taking place (step by step)?</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> What would the system’s response be like if negative feedback were not present?</p>
<p>I will provide answers for only one of the examples, the voltage regulator:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> What variable is being stabilized by negative feedback?</p>
<p><em>Output voltage.</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> How is the feedback taking place (step by step)?</p>
<p><em>When output voltage rises, the system takes action to drop more voltage internally, leaving less for the output.</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> What would the system’s response be like if negative feedback were not present?</p>
<p><em>Without negative feedback, the output voltage would rise and fall directly with the input voltage, and inversely with the load current.</em></p>
<p>It is difficult to overstate the importance of grasping negative feedback in the study of electronics. So many different types of systems depend on it for their operation that it cannot be omitted from any serious electronics curriculum. Yet I see many textbooks fail to explore this principle in adequate depth, or discuss it in a mathematical sense only where students are likely to miss the basic concept because they will be too focused on solving the equations.</p>
