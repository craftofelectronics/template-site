<p>Explain what will happen to the output waveform from this amplifier circuit if resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span> fails open:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03969x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The amplifier gain will become near-infinite, causing the output waveform to resemble a square-wave.</p>
