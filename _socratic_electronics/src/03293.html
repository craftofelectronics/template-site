<p>An ideal (perfect) current source is an abstraction with no accurate realization in life. However, we may approximate the behavior of an ideal current source with a high-voltage source and large series resistance:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03293x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Such a Thevenin equivalent circuit, however imperfect, will maintain a fairly constant current through a wide range of load resistance values.</p>
<p>Similarly, an ideal (perfect) voltage source is an abstraction with no accurate realization in life. Thankfully, though, it is not difficult to build voltage sources that are relatively close to perfect: circuits with very low internal resistance such that the output voltage sags only a little under high-current conditions.</p>
<p>But suppose we lived in a world where things were the opposite: where close-to-ideal <em>current</em> sources were simpler and more plentiful than close-to-ideal voltage sources. Draw a Norton equivalent circuit showing how to approximate an ideal voltage source using an ideal (perfect) current source and a shunt resistance.</p>

<p>This question is not so much a practical one as it is designed to get students to think a little deeper about the differences between ideal voltage and current sources. In other words, it focuses on concepts rather than application.</p>
