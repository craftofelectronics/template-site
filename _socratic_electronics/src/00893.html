<p>Install a potentiometer in this circuit so that the regulated output voltage of this power supply becomes adjustable:</p>

<p>Challenge: leave the potentiometer symbol in its place, and make the necessary wire connections between it and the rest of the circuit!</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00893x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Challenge question: for any given amount of load current, what voltage setting will cause the transistor to dissipate the most heat energy, low, medium, or high?</p>
<p>Some students may choose to place the potentiometer on the output of the power supply (connecting to the transistor’s emitter terminal). While this will work, technically, it is not a good solution because the load current will be severely limited by the potentiometer’s resistance. Discuss with your students why the circuit drawn in the answer is more practical.</p>
<p>The answer to the challenge question is nonintuitive, but it makes sense once you determine what variables affect transistor power dissipation (emitter current, and <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>C</em><em>E</em></sub></span>).</p>
