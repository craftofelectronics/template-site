<p>Solve for the value of <span class="math"><em>x</em></span> in the following equations:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$5x = 15 \hbox{\hskip 30pt} x =$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$6 = {x \over 2} \hbox{\hskip 30pt} x =$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$5x = 15 \hbox{\hskip 30pt} x = 3$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$6 = {x \over 2} \hbox{\hskip 30pt} x = 12$</span><br /></p>
<p>Have your students come to the front of the class and show everyone else the techniques they used to solve for the value of <span class="math"><em>x</em></span> in each equation. Remind them to document each and every step in the process, so that nothing is left to guess or to chance.</p>
