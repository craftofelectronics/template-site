<p>Determine the &quot;trip&quot; voltage of this comparator circuit: the value of input voltage at which the opamp’s output changes state from fully positive to fully negative or visa-versa:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02294x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Now, what do you suppose would happen if the output were fed back to the noninverting input through a resistor? You answer merely has to be qualitative, not quantitative:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02294x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>For your information, this circuit configuration is often referred to as a <em>Schmitt trigger</em>.</p>
<p>With no feedback resistor, the &quot;trip&quot; voltage would be 9.21 volts. With the feedback resistor in place, the &quot;trip&quot; voltage would change depending on the state of the opamp’s output!</p>
<p>Follow-up question: describe what effect this changing &quot;trip&quot; voltage value will have on the operation of this comparator circuit.</p>
<p>Schmitt trigger circuits are very popular for their ability to &quot;cleanly&quot; change states given a noisy input signal. I have intentionally avoided numerical calculations in this question, so that students may concentrate on the <em>concept</em> of positive feedback and how it affects this circuit.</p>
