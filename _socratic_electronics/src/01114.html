<p>There is a problem with this clipper circuit, as evidenced by the output waveform:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01114x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>What is the most likely cause of this problem, and how would you verify your conclusion with further measurements?</p>
<p>The diode might be failed open, but this is only one possibility.</p>
<p>Have your students figured out any other possibilities for the fault in this circuit? They do exist, and in fact may be more likely than a failed-open diode! Ask your students how and why they chose the answer they did, and be sure to have them explain their follow-up diagnostic procedures.</p>
