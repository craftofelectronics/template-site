<p>Size both resistors in this voltage divider circuit to provide 6 volts to the load, assuming that the load will draw 7 mA of current at this voltage, and to have a &quot;bleeder&quot; current of 1 mA going through <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span>:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01780x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>As part of your design, include the power dissipation ratings of both resistors.</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub> = 750 Ω </span> and <span class="math">$R_2 = 6 \hbox{ k}\Omega$</span>. <span class="math">$1 \over 8$</span> watt resistors are perfectly adequate to handle the dissipations in this circuit.</p>
<p>This may seem like a tricky problem to some students, as though it is lacking in information. All the necessary information is there, however. Students just need to think through all the laws of series-parallel circuits to piece together the necessary resistor values from the given specifications.</p>
