<p>Show which directions these free-floating ions would move, if exposed to an electric field of the polarity shown:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{04083x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Note: the &quot;H<span class="math">$^{+}$</span>&quot; ion is a positively charged hydrogen atom, while the &quot;OH<span class="math">$^{-}$</span>&quot; ion is a negatively charged hydroxyl ion.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{04083x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Follow-up question: which of these metal plates would we call the <em>cathode</em>, and which would we call the <em>anode</em>?</p>
<p>The scenario shown is not academic â€“ it is what happens when an electric field is applied to water. The dissociated ions move in opposite directions, liberating hydrogen gas at the negative electrode and oxygen gas at the positive.</p>
