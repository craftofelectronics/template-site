<p>An alternative to <em>soldering</em> components into printed circuit boards is to use a technique called <em>wire wrap</em>. Describe what &quot;wire wrap&quot; is and what applications it might be suitable for.</p>
<p>&quot;Wire wrap&quot; is a connection technique for joining components together on a circuit board without need for pre-printed copper &quot;traces&quot; on the board. Instead, small-gauge wire is tightly wrapped around the pins of each component, with the wire making point-to-point connections between components.</p>
<p>Though wire-wrapping is not as prevalent now as it was a few decades ago, it still has merit for certain applications, notably prototyping. If possible, have some wire-wrapped circuit boards available to show your students during discussion time.</p>
