<p>What does the term <em>transconductance</em> mean, with reference to a field-effect transistor? Is the transconductance function for an FET a linear or a nonlinear relationship? Explain why, making reference to an equation if at all possible to explain your answer.</p>
<p>&quot;Transconductance&quot; refers to the amount of change in drain current for a given amount of change in gate voltage (<span class="math">${\Delta I_D \over \Delta V_G}$</span>). The transconductance function for an FET is definitely nonlinear.</p>
<p>Challenge question: what unit of measurement would be appropriate for expressing transconductance in?</p>
<p>Transconductance is not just a parameter for JFETs, but also MOSFETs (IGFETs) and vacuum tubes. Any voltage-controlled current-regulating device has a transconductance value (though it may change over the operating range of the device, just as <span class="math"><em>Î²</em></span> changes over the operating range of a BJT).</p>
