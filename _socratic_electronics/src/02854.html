<p>Re-design the example circuit so that a NAND logic gate is not required. Instead, think of a way you could use discrete components to do the same job.</p>
<p>Iâ€™ll leave this part up to you!</p>
<p>Not only will a discrete transistor have a wider voltage range it can operate over (compared to a logic gate), but it is a good review of transistor circuit theory and a practical example of implementing a simple logic function without the benefit of integrated circuits.</p>
