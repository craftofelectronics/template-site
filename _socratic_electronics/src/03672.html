<p>The following equation is a general model for Hall effect devices, describing the voltage produced by a Hall element given the current through it (<span class="math"><em>I</em></span>), the magnetic flux density (<span class="math"><em>B</em></span>) passing through perpendicular to the current, and the thickness (<span class="math"><em>x</em></span>) of the Hall element. The variable <span class="math"><em>K</em></span> is a constant accounting for variations in material composition and temperature, and for any combination of units represented by the other variables:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$V_{Hall} = K {IB \over x}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03672x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Explain what this equation means with regard to the effect of each variable (<span class="math"><em>I</em></span>, <span class="math"><em>B</em></span>, and <span class="math"><em>x</em></span>) on the Hall voltage generated. Identify whether each of the variables has a <em>direct</em> or an <em>inverse</em> effect on the output voltage.</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>I</em></span> = direct effect</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>B</em></span> = direct effect</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>x</em></span> = inverse effect</p>
<p>Discuss with your students what it means for a variable to have a <em>direct</em> or <em>inverse</em> effect on another, and ask them to provide examples other than the Hall effect equation. If they cannot think of any, suggest Ohmâ€™s Law.</p>
