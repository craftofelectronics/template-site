<p>Determine the output voltage polarity of this op-amp (with reference to ground), given the following input conditions:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00803x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>In these illustrations, I have likened the op-ampâ€™s action to that of a single-pole, double-throw switch, showing the &quot;connection&quot; made between power supply terminals and the output terminal.</p>

<p>Determining which &quot;way&quot; the output of an op-amp drives under different input voltage conditions is confusing to many students. Discuss this with them, and ask them to present any principles or analogies they use to remember &quot;which way is which.&quot;</p>
