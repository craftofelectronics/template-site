<p>Describe the purpose of the transistor in this AC-DC power supply circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00892x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The transistor serves to &quot;boost&quot; the current-sourcing capability of the resistor/zener voltage regulator circuit, to provide far more current to a load than possible with the resistor/zener alone.</p>
<p>Ask your students to identify the configuration of this transistor amplifier (common-base, common-emitter, or common collector?). After they have done this, ask them to identify the current gain of such an amplifier, given a transistor <span class="math"><em>Î²</em></span> value of 90.</p>
