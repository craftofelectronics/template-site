<p>Suppose you need to build an inverting amplifier circuit to take a weak signal from an 8 <span class="math">Ω </span> microphone and amplify the voltage by a factor of 25. Choose the resistor values that will most efficiently accomplish this task (hint: we need to transfer the maximum power possible from the microphone to the amplifier).</p>
