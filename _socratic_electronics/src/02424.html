<p>Use circuit simulation software to verify your predicted and measured parameter values.</p>
<p>Being able to design a circuit using a MOSFET as a switch is a valuable skill for technicians and engineers alike to have.</p>
<p>An extension of this exercise is to incorporate troubleshooting questions. Whether using this exercise as a performance assessment or simply as a concept-building lab, you might want to follow up your studentsâ€™ results by asking them to predict the consequences of certain circuit faults.</p>
