<p>What will happen to each resistor’s voltage in this circuit if resistor R4 fails shorted? Provide individual answers for each resistor, please.</p>

<p>Also, comment on the practical likelihood of a resistor failing shorted, as opposed to failing open.</p>
<p>If resistor R4 fails shorted . . .</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>R</em>4</sub></span> will decrease to zero</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>R</em>1</sub></span> will increase</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>R</em>2</sub></span> will decrease</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>R</em>3</sub></span> will increase</p>
<p>Follow-up question: resistors are actually far less likely to fail shorted as they are to fail <em>open</em>. However, this does not mean something else on a circuit board cannot go wrong to make it appear as though a resistor failed shorted! One example of such a fault is called a <em>solder bridge</em>. Explain what this is, any why it could produce the same effect as a resistor failing shorted.</p>
<p>I have found in teaching that many students loathe qualitative analysis, because they cannot let their calculators do the thinking for them. However, being able to judge whether a circuit parameter will increase, decrease, or remain the same after a component fault is an <em>essential</em> skill for proficient troubleshooting.</p>
