<p>What is the difference between a JMP (&quot;jump&quot;) instruction and a CALL (&quot;call&quot;) instruction? Where might each type of branching command be used? Hint: one of these is used to execute a <em>subroutine</em>.</p>
<p>A JMP instruction simply tells the microprocessor to &quot;jump&quot; to a specified address. A CALL instruction similarly redirects program flow to a specified address, but remembers its place so the program may &quot;return&quot; where it left off.</p>
<p>Discuss the concept of a <em>subroutine</em> with your students, and how subroutines economize program size.</p>
