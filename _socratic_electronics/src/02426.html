<p>Junction field-effect transistors are very sensitive devices, requiring practically zero current to &quot;drive&quot; them into either cutoff or saturation. However, they usually cannot handle high drain currents â€“ in other words, they are not considered &quot;power&quot; switching devices.</p>
<p>If we combine a JFET with a BJT, though, we may realize the best features of each transistor: low drive current requirements combined with a high controlled current rating. Examine the following hybrid JFET/BJT circuits, and explain how each one works to control power to the load:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02426x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Determine for each circuit whether the load becomes energized when the switch is <em>closed</em> or when it is <em>opened</em>, and explain how each one works.</p>
<p>In each case, the load de-energizes with switch closure, and energizes when the switch is opened.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: explain the purpose of the resistor in each circuit. What might happen if it were not there?</p>
<p>This question is a good review of both BJT and JFET operating theory, as well as a practical example of how &quot;cascading&quot; different types of transistors may result in &quot;best of both worlds&quot; performance.</p>
