<p>Note: when testing the frequency response of the tone control circuit, you may need to replace the transformer/speaker assembly with a non-inductive resistor of equivalent impedance, and measure <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>o</em><em>u</em><em>t</em></sub></span> across it.</p>
<p>Use circuit simulation software to verify your predicted and measured parameter values.</p>
<p>A good source of audio signal is the headphone output jack of almost any radio, media player, or other portable audio device. Students like being able to do a lab exercise that directly relates to technology they’re already familiar with.</p>
<p>I have experienced good success with the following component values:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math"><em>C</em><sub>1</sub></span> = 0.1 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>F</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math"><em>L</em><sub>1</sub></span> = 200 mH (actually two 100 mH inductors in series)</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> = <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span> = 1 k<span class="math">Ω </span></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math"><em>T</em><sub>1</sub></span> = 1000:8 ohm audio output transformer</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>p</em><em>o</em><em>t</em></sub></span> = <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>p</em><em>o</em><em>t</em>2</sub></span> = 10 k<span class="math">Ω </span></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Speaker = small 8 <span class="math">Ω </span> unit (salvaged from an old clock radio or other inexpensive audio device)</p>
<p>An extension of this exercise is to incorporate troubleshooting questions. Whether using this exercise as a performance assessment or simply as a concept-building lab, you might want to follow up your students’ results by asking them to predict the consequences of certain circuit faults.</p>
