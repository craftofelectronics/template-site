<p>Use circuit simulation software to verify your predicted and measured parameter values.</p>
<p>This is perhaps the most reliable means of measuring inductance without an impedance bridge or an LCR meter. You may wish to ask your students to explain <em>why</em> this method of measurement is so good (hint: they must explain why the inductor’s intrinsic resistance has no effect on the measurement).</p>
<p>I prefer this particular circuit design for <span class="math"><em>L</em></span> measurement because series resistance does not skew the resonant point, and because the series capacitor prevents any possible DC current from &quot;biasing&quot; the inductor’s core.</p>
<p>If your students own high-quality multimeters capable of measuring audio-frequency AC current and frequency, then the best way to do this is to replace the resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> with their ammeters. Otherwise, use an oscilloscope to measure (maximum) voltage dropped across <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span>.</p>
<p>In order to obtain good measurements using this technique, I recommend following these guidelines:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Choose a value of <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> low enough to give a sharp bandwidth, but not so low that the voltage signal dropped across it is &quot;fuzzy&quot; with noise and difficult to accurately discern the period of.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Choose a value for <span class="math"><em>C</em><sub>1</sub></span> as low as possible to give sharp bandwidth (thereby maximizing the <span class="math">${L \over C}$</span> ratio), without pushing the circuit’s resonant frequency too close to the inductor’s self-resonant frequency.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Avoid frequencies above the audio range, lest your students measure the inductor’s self-resonant point!</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Use minimal output from the signal generator, to avoid voltage and current levels that will approach core saturation in the inductor.</p>
<p>I’ve had fair results using one of the windings of a small audio output transformer (center-tapped 1000 <span class="math">Ω </span> primary winding, with 8 <span class="math">Ω </span> secondary winding) as the inductor, connected in series with either a 0.1 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>F or a 0.47 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>F metal-film capacitor, all in series with a 100 ohm resistor. For best results, of course, pre-measure the value of the capacitor rather than go by its advertised value.</p>
<p>I have also used a 100 mH inductor (nominal), in series with a 0.033 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>F capacitor and 100 <span class="math">Ω </span> resistor, with good results.</p>
