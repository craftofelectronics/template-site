<p>The following circuit has a problem: the electric motor refuses to turn on.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03377x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>With the switch in the &quot;on&quot; position, you check the power source with your voltmeter, measuring 115 volts between terminals 1 and 3. Next, you check for voltage between terminals 1 and 5, and you measure 115 volts there as well. Based on this information, classify the status of each component/connection listed using one of these four ranks:</p>

{\bf Rank} &amp; {\bf Meaning} \cr
\noalign{\hrule}
{\it Definitely good} &amp; The measurements prove it is in good working order \cr
\noalign{\hrule}
{\it Definitely bad} &amp; The measurements prove it must be the only problem in the circuit \cr
\noalign{\hrule}
{\it Possibly bad} &amp; Could be the only problem, but something else might be bad instead \cr
\noalign{\hrule}
{\it Uncertain} &amp; Could be good or bad -- if bad, it would not be the only problem \cr
