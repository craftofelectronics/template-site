<p>How is it possible to tell that <em>overflow</em> has occurred in the addition of binary numbers, without converting the binary sums to decimal form and having a human being verify the answers?</p>
<p>Check the sign bit of the answer, and compare it to the sign bits of the <em>addend</em> and <em>augend</em>.</p>
<p>Challenge question: under what condition(s) is overflow impossible? When can we add two binary numbers together and know with certainty that the answer will be correct?</p>
<p>Later, this concept of overflow checking should be applied to a real circuit, with students designing logic gate arrays to detect the presence of overflow. First, though, they must learn to recognize its presence analytically.</p>
