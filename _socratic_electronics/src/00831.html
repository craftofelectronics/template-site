<p>Specialized forms of the decibel unit have been devised to allow easy representation of quantities other than arbitrary ratios of voltage, current, or power. Take for example these units, the first one used extensively in the telecommunications industry:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> dBm</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> dBW</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> dBk</p>
<p>Define what each of these units represents.</p>
<p>&quot;dBm&quot; represents the magnitude of a voltage in relation to 1 mW of power dissipated by a 600 <span class="math">Ω </span> load. &quot;dBW&quot; and &quot;dBk&quot; units represent the magnitude of a voltage in relation to 1 W and 1 kW of power dissipated by the same load, respectively.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: how many volts is 2 dBm equivalent to?</p>
<p>Here we see the decibel unit being used to represent <em>absolute</em> quantities rather than relative ratios. Ask your students what benefit would there be in doing this. Why not just represent signal magnitudes in units of &quot;volts&quot; instead? Why would we want to use an obscure unit such as the decibel?</p>
