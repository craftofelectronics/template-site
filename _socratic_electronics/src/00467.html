<p>If the number of turns of wire in an electromagnet coil is tripled, what happens to the magnitude of the magnetic flux (<span class="math">Φ </span>) generated by it, assuming that none of the other variables change (current through the coil, reluctance of magnetic circuit, etc.)?</p>
<p>If the number of turns of wire in an inductor is tripled, what happens to the magnitude of the induced voltage for a given rate of magnetic flux change over time (<span class="math">$d\phi \over dt$</span>)?</p>
<p>If the number of turns of wire in an inductor is tripled, what happens to the magnitude of its inductance, measured in Henrys? Explain your answer.</p>
<p>If <span class="math"><em>N</em></span> triples, then <span class="math">Φ </span> triples, all other factors being equal.</p>
<p>If <span class="math">${d\phi \over dt}$</span> triples, then <span class="math"><em>e</em></span> triples, all other factors being equal.</p>
<p>If <span class="math"><em>N</em></span> triples, then <span class="math"><em>L</em></span> increases by a factor of <em>nine</em>, all other factors being equal.</p>
<p>This question presents an interesting problem in qualitative mathematics. It is closely related to the &quot;chain rule&quot; in calculus, where one function <span class="math"><em>y</em> = <em>f</em>(<em>x</em>)</span> is embedded within another function <span class="math"><em>z</em> = <em>f</em>(<em>y</em>)</span>, such that <span class="math">${dz \over dy}{dy \over dx} = {dz \over dx}$</span>. The purpose of this exercise is for students to gain a conceptual grasp of why inductance does not vary linearly with changes in <span class="math"><em>N</em></span>.</p>
<p>Of course, students can obtain the same (third) answer just by looking at the inductance formula (in terms of <span class="math"><em>N</em></span>, <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>, <span class="math"><em>A</em></span>, and <span class="math"><em>l</em></span>), without all the conceptual work. It would be good, in fact, if a student happens to derive the same answer by inspection of this formula, just to add variety to the discussion. But the real purpose of this question, again, is a conceptual understanding of that formula.</p>
