<p>Two very important concepts to understand when working with digital memory devices are <em>address</em> and <em>data</em>. Define each of these terms in your own words.</p>
<p>Iâ€™ll let you research these terms on your own! There are many technical references available on digital memory technology, so finding definitions for &quot;address&quot; and &quot;data&quot; should not be difficult.</p>
<p>Analogies are often helpful to communicate the concepts of &quot;address&quot; and &quot;data&quot; to new students. I like to use the example of post office boxes (lots of addressed boxes, each containing different items) when I explain address and data.</p>
