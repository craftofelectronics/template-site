<p>Suppose a friend wanted to install filter networks in the &quot;woofer&quot; section of their stereo system, to prevent high-frequency power from being wasted in speakers incapable of reproducing those frequencies. To this end, your friend installs the following resistor-capacitor networks:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00614x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>After examining this schematic, you see that your friend has the right idea in mind, but implemented it incorrectly. These filter circuits would indeed block high-frequency signals from getting to the woofers, but they would not actually accomplish the stated goal of minimizing wasted power.</p>
<p>What would you recommend to your friend in lieu of this circuit design?</p>
<p>Rather than use a &quot;shunting&quot; form of low-pass filter (resistor and capacitor), a &quot;blocking&quot; form of low-pass filter (inductor) should be used instead.</p>
<p>The reason for this choice in filter designs is very practical. Ask your students to describe how a &quot;shunting&quot; form of filter works, where the reactive component is connected in parallel with the load, receiving power through a series resistor. Contrast this against a &quot;blocking&quot; form of filter circuit, in which a reactive component is connected in series with the load. In one form of filter, a resistor is necessary. In the other form of filter, a resistor is not necessary. What difference does this make in terms of power dissipation within the filter circuit?</p>
