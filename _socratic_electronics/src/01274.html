<p>What is the typical power supply voltage range for a CD4xxx series (or MC4xxx series) CMOS logic gate? How does this compare with the allowable power supply voltage range for a standard (5 volt) TTL logic gate? Consult a datasheet for your answer.</p>
<p>3 to 18 VDC is typical, though some integrated circuits may have slightly different ratings.</p>
<p>This question gets students in the habit of consulting datasheets to obtain information on logic gate circuits. Datasheets are a wealth of technical information, and students absolutely have to become adept at referencing them to obtain the information they need to build and troubleshoot logic circuits.</p>
