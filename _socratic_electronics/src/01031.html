<p><em>Photodiodes</em> may be operated in either &quot;photovoltaic&quot; mode or in &quot;photoconductive&quot; mode. Describe the difference between these two modes, drawing schematic diagrams showing how a photodiode would be used in each mode.</p>

<p>Ask your students whether a regular LED could be used as a photodiode in each of these modes. How would they set up an experiment to test an LEDâ€™s ability to act as a photodiode in each mode?</p>
