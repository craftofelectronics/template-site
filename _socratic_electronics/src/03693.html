<p>Suppose you had an AC/DC power supply, which performed as follows (open-circuit and loaded test conditions):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03693x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Draw a Thévenin equivalent circuit to model the behavior of this power supply.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03693x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Follow-up question: is the switch shown in the <em>on</em> or <em>off</em> position, in the pictorial diagram?</p>
<p>Discuss with your students how Thévenin’s theorem allows us to model fairly complex power-supply circuits as simply a voltage source and series resistance (at least approximately). Discuss also the limitations of this modeling, especially in light of the condition of linearity for the proper application of Thévenin’s theorem.</p>
