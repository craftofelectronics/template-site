<p>Small inductors often look like resistors, even to the extent that their values are designated by colored bands. Determine the values of the following inductors (express the tolerance as a percentage), based on their color codes:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Red, Grn, Brn, Gld</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Wht, Org, Red, Sil</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Grn, Gry, Blk</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Vio, Blu, Org, Gld</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Red, Grn, Brn, Gld = 250 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>H, +/- 5%</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Wht, Org, Red, Sil = 9300 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>H, +/- 10%</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Grn, Gry, Blk = 58 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>H, +/- 20%</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Vio, Blu, Org, Gld = 76 mH, +/- 5%</p>
<p>Students will note a lot of similarities between the inductor color code and the resistor color code, but they should also note one significant difference!</p>
