<p>Calculate the amount of power dissipated by this electric heating element, if the generator’s output voltage is 110 volts and the heater’s resistance is 2.5 ohms:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00179x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Now, calculate the power dissipated by the same heater if the generator’s output voltage is doubled.</p>
<p>4,840 watts at 110 volts; 19,360 watts at 220 volts.</p>
<p>Many students will mistakenly calculate 9,680 watts as the power dissipation at 220 volts. However, power dissipation does not increase linearly with increases in voltage!</p>
