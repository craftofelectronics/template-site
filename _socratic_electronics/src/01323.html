<p>What is <em>DeMorgan’s Theorem</em>?</p>
<p>DeMorgan’s Theorem is a rule for Boolean expressions, declaring how long complementation &quot;bars&quot; are to be broken into shorter bars. I’ll let you research the terms of this rule, and explain how to apply it to Boolean expressions.</p>
<p>There are many suitable references for students to be able to learn DeMorgan’s Theorem from. Let them do the research on their own! Your task is to clarify any misunderstandings after they’ve done their jobs.</p>
