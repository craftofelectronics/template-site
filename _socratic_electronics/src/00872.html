<p>In this circuit, a solar cell converts light into voltage for the opamp to &quot;read&quot; on its noninverting input. The opamp’s inverting input connects to the wiper of a potentiometer. Under what conditions does the LED energize?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00872x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The LED energizes under bright-light conditions, de-energizing when the light decreases below the threshold set by the potentiometer.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: determine what would have to be changed in this circuit to make the LED turn on when the solar cell becomes <em>dark</em>.</p>
<p>There is more than one way to accomplish the task posed by the follow-up question. Be sure to ask your students for their ideas on how to reverse the LED’s operation!</p>
