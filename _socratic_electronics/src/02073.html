<p>Metal Oxide Field-Effect Transistors (MOSFETs) differ in behavior from Bipolar Junction Transistors (BJTs) in several ways. Address each one of these behavioral aspects in your answer:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Current gain</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Conduction with no input (gate/base) signal</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Polarization</p>
<p>MOSFETs have <em>much</em> greater current gains than BJTs.</p>
<p>BJTs are normally-off devices, whereas a MOSFET may either be normally-on or normally-off depending on its manufacture.</p>
<p>MOSFETs can pass current from source to drain, or from drain to source with equal ease. BJTs can only pass current from emitter to collector in one direction.</p>
<p>For each one of these behavioral aspects, discuss with your students exactly <em>why</em> the two transistors types differ.</p>
