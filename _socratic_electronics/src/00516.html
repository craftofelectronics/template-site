<p>An important equation in predicting the capacity of a lead-acid cell is called <em>Peukert’s formula</em>:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math"><em>I</em><sup><em>n</em></sup><em>t</em> = <em>C</em></span><br /></p>
<p>Where,</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>I</em> = </span> Discharge current, in amps</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>n</em> = </span> Constant, particular to the cell (typically between 1.1 and 1.8)</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>t</em> = </span> Time of discharge</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>C</em> = </span> Constant, particular to the battery (varies with the amp-hour capacity)</p>
<p>Explain how Peukert’s formula relates to the simpler &quot;amp-hour&quot; formula.</p>
<p>Also, calculate the discharge time for a battery with an <span class="math"><em>n</em></span> value of 1.2 and a <span class="math"><em>C</em></span> value of 200, given a discharge current of 25 amps.</p>
<p>The &quot;amp-hour&quot; formula is linear, while Peukert’s formula is not (at least for values of <span class="math"><em>n</em></span> not equal to unity).</p>
<p>The discharge time for the example problem is 4.2 hours.</p>
<p>Ask one of your students to write Peukert’s equation on the whiteboard in front of class, along with the standard amp-hour formula. Viewed side-by-side, there is but one difference between the two equations, and it is the exponent <span class="math"><em>n</em></span>.</p>
