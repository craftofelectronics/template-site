<p>Contrast <em>class-A</em>, <em>class-B</em>, and <em>class-C</em> amplifier operations, explaining what defines each class. Then, rank these three classes in order of least power efficiency to greatest power efficiency.</p>
<p>Iâ€™ll let you research what the definition of each &quot;class&quot; of amplifier operation is! These definitions are fairly easy to find, so you should not experience much difficulty.</p>
<p>Class-A is least efficient, followed by class-B, and then class-C which is most power efficient.</p>
<p>Students are liable to wonder why class-C operation is not the most popular in electronic circuits, since it is the most power-efficient of the three classes. Discuss the limitations of class-C operation, specifically in terms of waveform distortion.</p>
