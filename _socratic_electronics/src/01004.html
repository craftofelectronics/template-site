<p>Write a mathematical expression in the form of <span class="math"><em>y</em> = …<em>x</em></span> describing the function of this circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01004x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math"><em>y</em> =  − <em>x</em></span></p>
<p>Your students should be able to recognize that this amplifier circuit has a voltage gain of 1, and that it is <em>inverting</em> in nature, but expressing it in the form of an equation using variables such as <span class="math"><em>x</em></span> and <span class="math"><em>y</em></span> may be something very new to them. Discuss with your students the significance of this notation: that a <em>circuit</em> may embody an <em>equation</em>.</p>
