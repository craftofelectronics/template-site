<p>What will the output voltage of this integrator circuit do when the DPDT (&quot;Double-Pole, Double-Throw&quot;) switch is flipped back and forth?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02706x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Be as specific as you can in your answer, explaining what happens in the switchâ€™s &quot;up&quot; position as well as in its &quot;down&quot; position.</p>
<p>With the switch in the &quot;up&quot; position, the opamp output linearly ramps in a negative-going direction over time. With the switch in the &quot;down&quot; position, the opamp output linearly ramps in a positive-going direction over time.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: what do you suppose the output of the following circuit would do over time (assuming the square wave input was true AC, positive and negative)?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02706x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The DPDT switch arrangement may be a bit confusing, but its only purpose is to provide a reversible input voltage polarity. Discuss with your students the directions of all currents in this circuit for both switch positions, and how the opamp output integrates over time for different input voltages.</p>
