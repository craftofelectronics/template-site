<p>Explain why this happens, and what must be done to fix the problem.</p>
<p>Too much triggering voltage is being applied to the TRIAC in this configuration. I’ll let you determine how to re-wire the circuit to avoid this problem!</p>
<p>I’ve seen students do this a few times, with startling results!</p>
