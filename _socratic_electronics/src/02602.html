<p>An important AC performance parameter for operational amplifiers is <em>slew rate</em>. Explain what &quot;slew rate&quot; is, and what causes it to be less than optimal for an opamp.</p>
<p><em>Slew rate</em> is the maximum rate of change of output voltage over time (<span class="math">${dv \over dt}\big|_{max}$</span>) that an opamp can muster.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: what would the output waveform of an opamp look like if it were trying to amplify a square wave signal with a frequency and amplitude exceeding the amplifierâ€™s slew rate?</p>
<p>The follow-up question is very important, as it asks students to apply the concept of a maximum <span class="math">${dv \over dt}$</span> to actual waveshapes. This is often discussed by introductory textbooks, though, so it should not be difficult for students to find good information to help them formulate an answer.</p>
