<p>Identify the type of logic gate shown in this schematic diagram, and explain why it has the name it does:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02759x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>This is an <strong>OR</strong> gate, so named because its output goes high if either input A is high <em>or</em> input B is high.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: replace the two SPDT switches with SPST switches, complete with pullup or pulldown resistors as necessary.</p>
<p>Your students should have no great difficulty identifying this particular logic gate if they have a good digital electronics reference book at their disposal.</p>
