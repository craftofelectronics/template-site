<p>A student builds this simple S-R latch for their lab experiment:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01378x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>When the student powers up this circuit, she notices something strange. Sometimes the latch powers up in the <em>set</em> state (<span class="math"><em>Q</em></span> high and <span class="math">$\overline{Q}$</span> low), and other times it powers up in the <em>reset</em> state (<span class="math"><em>Q</em></span> low and <span class="math">$\overline{Q}$</span> high). The power-up state of their circuit seems to be unpredictable.</p>
<p>What state <em>should</em> their circuit power up in? Did the student make an error building the latch circuit?</p>
<p>The circuit is fine, and working properly. The normal power-up state of a latch circuit is unpredictable, so long as both the inputs are inactive.</p>
<p>Although the circuit itself is simple, the phenomenon is not. Tell your students that what theyâ€™re dealing with here is something called a <em>race condition</em>, where two or more gates try to &quot;race&quot; each other to reach a certain logic state. Analyze the power-up state of this circuit with your students, and they will see that an unstable condition exists when both inputs are inactive!</p>
