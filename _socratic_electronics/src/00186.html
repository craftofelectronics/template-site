<p>What is a <em>Leyden Jar</em>, and how it its construction similar to the construction of all <em>capacitors</em>?</p>
<p>A &quot;Leyden Jar&quot; is a device used by early experimenters of static electricity to store electrical charges. It is made from a glass jar, lined inside and outside with metal foil. The glass insulates the two layers of metal foil from each other, and permits the storage of electric charge, manifested as a voltage between the two foil layers.</p>
<p>All capacitors share a common design feature of Leyden jars: the separation of two conductive plates by an insulating medium.</p>
<p>Encourage your students to find a picture of a Leyden Jar, or even to build their own. One canâ€™t help but notice the functional equivalence between a capacitor and a jar: storing charge versus storing substance!</p>
<p>A jar is not the only object which may be transformed into a capacitor. Aluminum foil and paper sheets may also be used to make a rudimentary capacitor. Have your students experiment with building their own capacitors, especially if they have access to a capacitance meter which may be used to compare the capacitance of different designs.</p>
