<p>A technician prepares to use an oscilloscope to display an AC voltage signal. After turning the oscilloscope on and connecting the Y input probe to the signal source test points, this display appears:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00533x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>What appears on the oscilloscope screen is a vertical line that moves slowly from left to right. What display control(s) need to be adjusted on the oscilloscope in order to show a normal-looking wave on the screen?</p>
<p>The &quot;timebase&quot; control needs to be adjusted for fewer seconds per division.</p>
<p>Discuss the function of both these controls with your students. If possible, demonstrate this scenario using a real oscilloscope and function generator, and have students adjust the controls to get the waveform to display optimally.</p>
