<p>Calculate the amount of phase shift between voltage and current in an AC circuit with a power factor of 0.97 (lagging), and an apparent power of 3.5 kVA. Also, write the equation solving for phase shift, in degrees.</p>
<p><span class="math">Θ  = arccos(<em>P</em><em>F</em>)</span> = 14.1<span class="math">$^{o}$</span></p>
<p>Ask your students whether this circuit is predominantly capacitive or predominantly inductive, and also how they know it is such.</p>
<p>It is very important for students to be able to solve for angles in simple trigonometric equations, using &quot;arcfunctions,&quot; so be sure you discuss the method of solution for this question with your students.</p>
