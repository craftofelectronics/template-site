<p>Transistors act as <em>controlled current sources</em>. That is, with a fixed control signal in, they tend to regulate the amount of current going through them. Design an experimental circuit to prove this tendency of transistors. In other words, how could you <em>demonstrate</em> this current-regulating behavior to be a fact?</p>

<p>Procedure: measure the voltage dropped across <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>C</em></sub></span> while varying <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>C</em><em>C</em></sub></span>, for several different values of <span class="math"><em>I</em><sub><em>B</em></sub></span> (inferred by measuring voltage drop across <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>B</em></sub></span>).</p>
<p>Here, students must think like an experimental scientist: figuring out how to prove the relative stability of one variable despite variations in another, while holding the controlling variable constant. Encourage your students to actually build this circuit!</p>
