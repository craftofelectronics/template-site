<p>In this circuit, is the light bulb lit? Why or why not?</p>
<p>Also, compare the relative indications of the two ammeters (which ammeter registers the greatest amount of current, and which ammeter registers the least amount of current, or do they both register the same amount of current?).</p>

<p>The bulb is lit, and the two ammeters register equal amounts of current.</p>
<p>This is a good question to engage studentsâ€™ thinking on meter properties. A voltmeter does not function the same as an ammeter, and the two different types of meters will impact circuits differently when connected! Incidentally, ammeters tend to get you into more trouble than voltmeters when troubleshooting circuits, which is why students should be encouraged to use a voltmeter whenever possible rather than an ammeter. Of course, clamp-on ammeters are not as unsafe as ammeters requiring direct connection with circuit conductors.</p>
