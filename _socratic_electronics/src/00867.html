<p>A <em>Class-A</em> transistor amplifier uses a single transistor to generate an output signal to a load. The amplifier shown here happens to be of the &quot;common collector&quot; topology, one of three configurations common to single-transistor circuits:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00867x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>An analogue for this electronic circuit is this water-pressure control, consisting of a variable valve passing water through an orifice (a restriction), then on to a drain:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00867x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The &quot;input&quot; to this amplifier is the positioning of the valve control handle. The &quot;output&quot; of this amplifier is water pressure measured at the end of the horizontal &quot;output&quot; pipe.</p>
<p>Explain how either of these &quot;circuits&quot; meets the criteria of being an amplifier. In other words, explain how <em>power</em> is boosted from input to output in both these systems. Also, describe how efficient each of these amplifiers is, &quot;efficiency&quot; being a measure of how much current (or water) goes to the load device, as compared to how much just goes straight through the controlling element and back to ground (the drain).</p>
<p>In both systems, a small amount of energy (current through the &quot;base&quot; terminal of the transistor, mechanical motion of the valve handle) exerts control over a larger amount of energy (current to the load, water to the load). The systems shown here are rather wasteful, especially at high output voltage (pressure).</p>
<p>Wasteful they may be, but &quot;Class-A&quot; transistor circuits find very common use in modern electronics. Explain to your students that its inefficiency restricts its practical use to low-power applications.</p>
