<p>One of the simplest transistor &quot;logic&quot; circuits used in computer circuitry is the so-called <em>inverter gate</em>. Its logic diagram symbol is this:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00503x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Inverters are often bundled six to a &quot;DIP&quot; (Dual-Inline Package) module, where all gates share the same two power supply connections (&quot;<span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>c</em><em>c</em></sub></span>&quot; and &quot;Ground&quot;), like this:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00503x03.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>When constructed with bipolar junction transistors, the internal schematic diagram of a single inverter gate looks something like this:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00503x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Being a digital logic circuit, it only &quot;understands&quot; two states: on and off. As you can see, a SPDT switch provides signal input into the logic gate, either full supply voltage (<span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>C</em><em>C</em></sub></span>) or no voltage at all (Gnd).</p>
<p>Determine the voltage across the load resistance for each of these switch states. Based on your analysis, what is the logical function of an &quot;inverter&quot; gate?</p>
<p>An &quot;inverter&quot; gate simply reverses the logic state of the input.</p>
<p>There is much to analyze in this circuit, and this question is not intended to be a full introduction to digital logic. It does, however, provide a preview of things to come, as well as an excellent opportunity to analyze diode and transistor circuitry in the simplest possible way: either fully &quot;on&quot; or fully &quot;off&quot;.</p>
<p>One tactic I have found useful as an instructor for analyzing complex circuits in front of a class is to project the image onto a whiteboard using a bright computer projector. Then, you may use dry-erase markers on the whiteboard to &quot;comment&quot; the diagram with voltage and current notations as you proceed to analyze the circuit with your students. Analyzing the circuit for a different logic state is easy: merely erase the &quot;comments&quot; made previously, and the schematic itself is unchanged, ready to be &quot;marked up&quot; again.</p>
