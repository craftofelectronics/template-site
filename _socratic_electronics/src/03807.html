<p>Explain why carefully matched resistors and transistors are necessary in log/antilog circuits, using your own words. Also, explain why the operational amplifiers themselves need not be matched as precisely as the discrete components.</p>
<p>I said, &quot;your own words,&quot; not mine! What are you looking here for?</p>
<p>This question challenges students to identify the &quot;weak points&quot; of log/antilog circuits, explaining <em>why</em> certain component tolerances are critical and others are not. This is a good test of studentsâ€™ understanding regarding log/antilog circuits and their underlying theory.</p>
