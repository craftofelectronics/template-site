<p>Explain what is meant by the phrase, &quot;Class-A amplifier operation.&quot; What does it mean for a particular amplifier circuit to operate in &quot;Class-A&quot; mode?</p>
<p>&quot;Class-A&quot; amplifier operation means that the final (power) transistor duplicates the entire waveshape of the input signal, and not just a part of it.</p>
<p>Of course, the natural question following this one is, &quot;What other classes of operation are there?&quot; This would be an excellent time to preview Class-B (push-pull) and Class-C operations if time permits.</p>
