<p>The &quot;1N400x&quot; series of rectifying diodes are very popular for low-current applications. By &quot;1N400x,&quot; I mean the 1N4001, 1N4002, 1N4003, . . . 1N4007. Only one parameter differs between these different diode models. What parameter is this, and what is its significance?</p>
<p>Only the <em>reverse</em> (or <em>blocking</em>) voltage rating differs between these diode models.</p>
<p>Be sure to ask your students where they found the information on these different diode models!</p>
<p>Discuss with your students the importance of this rating, and why a person might choose the 1N4007 diode for an application rather than the 1N4001, for instance.</p>
