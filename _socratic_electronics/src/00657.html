<p>Suppose you were to take a 3 kW electric heater rated for 240 VAC and connect it to a 120 VAC power source. How much power would it dissipate when connected to a voltage source equal to <em>half</em> its rating?</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>P</em> = </span> 750 W</p>
<p>A common mistake students make is to think that applying half the normal amount of voltage to a resistor results in half the power dissipation. This is not correct. There are many ways to disprove the assertion mathematically, and I won’t bother to list my favorite here. Discuss this with your students, and see what <em>their</em> reasoning is.</p>
