<p>An essential part of an AC-DC power supply circuit is the <em>filter</em>, used to separate the residual AC (called the &quot;ripple&quot; voltage) from the DC voltage prior to output. Here are two simple AC-DC power supply circuits, one without a filter and one with:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00789x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Draw the respective output voltage waveforms of these two power supply circuits (<span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>u</em><em>n</em><em>f</em><em>i</em><em>l</em><em>t</em><em>e</em><em>r</em><em>e</em><em>d</em></sub></span> versus <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>f</em><em>i</em><em>l</em><em>t</em><em>e</em><em>r</em><em>e</em><em>d</em></sub></span>). Also identify the type of filter circuit needed for the task (low pass, high pass, band pass, or band stop), and explain why that type of filter circuit is needed.</p>

<p>A low pass filter is the kind needed to filter &quot;ripple voltage&quot; from the power supply output.</p>
<p>Many years ago, when I was first learning about power supplies, I tried to power an automotive radio with voltage from a battery charger. The battery charger was a simple power supply suitable for charging 12-volt automotive batteries, I reasoned, so what harm would there be in using it to power an automotive radio? After a few moments of LOUD humming from the radio speaker, my rhetorical question was answered by a puff of smoke from the radio, then silence.</p>
<p>Part of the problem was the output voltage of the battery charger, but a large part of the problem was the fact that the chargerâ€™s output was <em>unfiltered</em> as well. For the same reasons my radio did not function properly on unfiltered, rectified AC, many electronic circuits will not function on it either.</p>
