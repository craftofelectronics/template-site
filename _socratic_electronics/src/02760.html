<p>Identify the type of logic gate shown in this schematic diagram, and explain why it has the name it does:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02760x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>This is an <strong>AND</strong> gate, so named because its output goes high only if input A is high <em>and</em> input B is high.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: show how a light-emitting diode could be connected to the output of this logic gate to provide visual indication of its output state.</p>
<p>Challenge question: show how this logic gate could drive a high-current load such as a solenoid or an electric motor.</p>
<p>Your students should have no great difficulty identifying this particular logic gate if they have a good digital electronics reference book at their disposal.</p>
