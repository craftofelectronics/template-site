<p>In general terms, describe what must be done to <em>balance</em> this bridge circuit. What, exactly, does the term &quot;balance&quot; mean in this context?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00544x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Also, write an equation containing only the four resistor values (<span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span>, <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span>, <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>3</sub></span>, and <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>4</sub></span>) showing their relationship to one another in a balanced condition.</p>
<p>For a bridge circuit to be &quot;balanced&quot; means that there is zero voltage between the two opposite corners of the circuit (where the battery does <em>not</em>) connect. Achieving a condition of &quot;balance&quot; in a bridge circuit requires that the resistance ratios of the four &quot;arms&quot; of the circuit be in proportion:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">${R_1 \over R_3} = {R_2 \over R_4}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Follow-up question: the bridge-balance equation shown above may also be written in a slightly different form:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">${R_1 \over R_2} = {R_3 \over R_4}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Show algebraically how the first equation may be manipulated to take the form of the second equation, thus demonstrating these two equationsâ€™ equivalence.</p>
<p>Challenge your students to write a &quot;balance equation&quot; describing how the ratios must relate to each other in order to achieve balance.</p>
