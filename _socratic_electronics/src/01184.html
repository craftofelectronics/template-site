<p>The circuit shown here is a precision DC voltmeter:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01184x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Explain why this circuit design requires the use of a field-effect transistor, and not a bipolar junction transistor (BJT).</p>
<p>Also, answer the following questions about the circuit:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Explain, step by step, how an increasing input voltage between the test probes causes the meter movement to deflect further.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> If the most sensitive range of this voltmeter is 0.1 volts (full-scale), calculate the other range values, and label them on the schematic next to their respective switch positions.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> What type of JFET configuration is this (common-gate, common-source, or common-drain)?</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> What purpose does the capacitor serve in this circuit?</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> What detrimental effect would result from installing a capacitor that was too large?</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Estimate a reasonable value for the capacitor’s capacitance.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Explain the functions of the &quot;Zero&quot; and &quot;Span&quot; calibration potentiometers.</p>
<p>The voltage ranges for this meter are as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> 0.1 volts</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> 0.2 volts</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> 1.0 volts</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> 2.0 volts</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> 10 volts</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> 20 volts</p>
<p>The JFET is being used in the <em>common drain</em> configuration. A reasonable value for the capacitor would be 0.01 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>F.</p>
<p>This relatively simple DC voltage amplifier circuit provides a wealth of educational value, both for understanding the function of the JFET, and also for review on past electrical/electronics concepts.</p>
