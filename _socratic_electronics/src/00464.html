<p>There are two wire windings wrapped around a common iron bar in this illustration, such that whatever magnetic flux may be produced by one winding is fully shared by the other winding:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00464x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Write two equations describing the induced voltage at each winding (<span class="math"><em>e</em><sub><em>p</em></sub> = …</span> and <span class="math"><em>e</em><sub><em>s</em></sub> = …</span>), in each case expressing the induced voltage in terms of the instantaneous magnetic flux (<span class="math"><em>ϕ</em></span>) and the number of turns of wire in that winding (<span class="math"><em>N</em><sub><em>p</em></sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>N</em><sub><em>s</em></sub></span>, respectively).</p>
<p>Then, combine these two equations, based on the fact that the magnetic flux is equal for each winding.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$e_p = N_p{d\phi \over dt}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$e_s = N_s{d\phi \over dt}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Then, combining the two equations:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">${e_p \over N_p} = {e_s \over N_s}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Obtaining the last equation is an application of the mathematical truth that quantities equal to the same thing are equal to each other (if <span class="math"><em>a</em> = <em>c</em></span> and <span class="math"><em>b</em> = <em>c</em></span>, then <span class="math"><em>a</em> = <em>b</em></span>).</p>
