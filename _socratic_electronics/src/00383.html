<p>If current is passed through a loop of wire, as shown, which direction will the loop rotate?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00383x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Clockwise, one-quarter turn (90 degrees).</p>
<p>Ask your students to identify the poles of the electromagnetic field produced by this current-carrying wire loop, and then its direction of torque may become easier to understand.</p>
