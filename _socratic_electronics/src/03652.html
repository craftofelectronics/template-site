<p>Calculate the output voltage of this passive differentiator circuit 1 millisecond after the rising edge of each positive square wave pulse (where the square wave transitions from -5 volts to +5 volts):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03652x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>o</em><em>u</em><em>t</em></sub></span> = 2.82 volts @ 1 ms after rising edge</p>
<p>This question is nothing more than an exercise in time-constant circuit calculations: determining how far the output voltage has decayed from its peak of 10 volts after 1 millisecond. Ask your students to share their techniques for problem-solving with the whole class.</p>
