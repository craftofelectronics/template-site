<p>Suppose you were given the following two equations and asked to find solutions for <span class="math"><em>x</em></span> and <span class="math"><em>y</em></span> that will satisfy <em>both</em> at the same time:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math"><em>y</em> + <em>x</em> = 8</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math"><em>y</em> − <em>x</em> = 3</span><br /></p>
<p>If we manipulate the second equation so as to solve for <span class="math"><em>y</em></span>, we will have a definition of <span class="math"><em>y</em></span> in terms of <span class="math"><em>x</em></span> that we may use for substitution in the first equation:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math"><em>y</em> = <em>x</em> + 3</span><br /></p>
<p>Show the process of substitution into the first equation, and how this leads to a single solution for <span class="math"><em>x</em></span>. Then, use that value of <span class="math"><em>x</em></span> to solve for <span class="math"><em>y</em></span>, resulting in a solution set valid for <em>both</em> equations.</p>
<p>If <span class="math"><em>y</em> + <em>x</em> = 8</span> and <span class="math"><em>y</em> = <em>x</em> + 3</span>, then <span class="math">(<em>x</em> + 3) + <em>x</em> = 8</span>. Therefore,</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$x = 2.5 \hbox{ and } y = 5.5$</span><br /></p>
<p>This question demonstrates one of the (many) practical uses of algebraic substitution: solving simultaneous systems of equations.</p>
