<p>How does the <em>conductance</em> (G) of a conductor relate to its length? In other words, the longer the conductor, the () its conductance is, all other factors being equal.</p>
<p>Conductance decreases as length increases, all other factors being equal.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: how does &quot;conductance&quot; (G) mathematically relate to resistance (R), and what is the unit of measurement for conductance?</p>
<p>There are two units of measurement for conductance: the old unit (which makes perfect sense, even though your students may laugh at it, at first), and the new unit (named after a famous electrical researcher). Make sure your students are familiar with both.</p>
