<p>Use circuit simulation software to verify your predicted and measured parameter values.</p>
<p>I have had great success with the following values:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>C</em><em>C</em></sub></span> = 7 to 24 volts</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math"><em>C</em><sub>1</sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>C</em><sub>2</sub></span> = 0.22 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>F</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math"><em>C</em><sub>3</sub></span> = 0.47 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>F</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math"><em>L</em><sub>1</sub></span> = 100 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>H (ferrite core RF choke)</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> = 22 k<span class="math">Ω </span></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span> = 1.5 M<span class="math">Ω </span></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math"><em>Q</em><sub>1</sub></span> = part number 2N3403</p>
<p>With these component values, the output waveform was quite clean and the frequency was very close to predicted:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$f_{out} = {1 \over {2 \pi \sqrt{L C_1 C_2 \over C_1 + C_2}}}$</span><br /></p>
<p>You might want to quiz your students on the purpose of resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span>, since it usually only has to be present at power-up to initiate oscillation!</p>
<p>An extension of this exercise is to incorporate troubleshooting questions. Whether using this exercise as a performance assessment or simply as a concept-building lab, you might want to follow up your students’ results by asking them to predict the consequences of certain circuit faults.</p>
