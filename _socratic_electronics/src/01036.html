<p>Is it possible to regard this complex network of power sources and resistances as a simple voltage source (one ideal voltage source in series with an internal resistance), or as a simple current source (one ideal current source in parallel with an internal resistance)? Why or why not?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01036x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Yes, because all the constituent components are <em>linear</em> and <em>bilateral</em>.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: why would anyone want to represent this complex network as either a simple voltage source or a simple current source?</p>
<p>Ask your students what it means for an electrical or electronic component to be considered &quot;linear,&quot; and also what it means to be considered &quot;bilateral.&quot; Can they give examples of components that are nonlinear, and/or unilateral?</p>
