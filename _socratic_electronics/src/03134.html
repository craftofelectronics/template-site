<p>Match the following time-delay relay contact type symbols and labels:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03134x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Normally-open, on-delay</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Normally-open, off-delay</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Normally-closed, on-delay</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Normally-closed, off-delay</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03134x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Follow-up question: how do you make sense of the arrow in each contact symbol, with regard to whether the contact is an &quot;on-delay&quot; or an &quot;off-delay&quot;?</p>
<p>Ask your students to present their personal explanations of how to make sense of the arrow directions, in relation to whether the relay is an &quot;on-delay&quot; or an &quot;off-delay.&quot; The correlation is really not that complex, but it is a good thing to clearly elaborate on it for the benefit of the whole class. You may want to re-phrase the question like this: &quot;Is it possible to determine whether each contact is on- or off-delay merely by looking at the arrow, or must one also consider the &quot;normal&quot; status?&quot;</p>
<p>If some students believe this may be determined by arrow direction alone, show them these symbols:</p>
