<p>Explain the purpose of a <em>magnitude comparator</em> IC such as the 74LS85. What function, or functions, does it perform?</p>
<p>I will let you research the datasheet for a magnitude comparator on your own to discover the answer(s)!</p>
<p>Be sure to ask students where they obtained their information. It is very easy to obtain datasheets online (over the internet), making it convenient to assign short research projects such as this.</p>
