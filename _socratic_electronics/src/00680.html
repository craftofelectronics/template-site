<p>Electrically conductive materials may be rated according to their relative resistance by a quantity we call <em>specific resistance</em> (<span class="math"><em>ρ</em></span>). The formula relating resistance to specific resistance looks like this:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$R = \rho{l \over A}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Where,</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>R</em> = </span> Electrical resistance, in ohms</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>ρ</em> = </span> Specific resistance, in ohm-cmil/ft, or some other combination of units</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>l</em> = </span> Length of conductor, in feet or cm (depending on units for <span class="math"><em>ρ</em></span>)</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>A</em> = </span> Cross-sectional area of conductor, in cmil or cm<span class="math">$^{2}$</span> (depending on units for <span class="math"><em>ρ</em></span>)</p>
<p>Magnetic materials may also be rated according to their relative reluctance by a quantity we call <em>permeability</em> (<span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>). Write the formula relating reluctance to permeability of a magnetic substance, and note whatever differences and similarities you see between it and the specific resistance formula for electrical circuits.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\Re = {l \over {\mu A}}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Ask your students to describe the effects on magnetic reluctance resulting from increases and decreases in all three independent variables (<span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>, <span class="math"><em>l</em></span>, and <span class="math"><em>A</em></span>). It is important for them to qualitatively grasp this equation, just as it is important for them to qualitatively understand Ohm’s Law and the specific resistance formula.</p>
