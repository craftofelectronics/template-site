<p>Suppose this battery and light bulb circuit failed to work:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00125x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Using a voltmeter, a technician measures 0 volts between the points C and H. The result of this single measurement indicates which half of the circuit there is a definite problem in. What would you recommend as the <em>next</em> voltmeter measurement to take in troubleshooting the circuit, following the same &quot;divide in half&quot; strategy?</p>
<p>To &quot;divide the circuit in half&quot; again, measure voltage between points B and G.</p>
<p>Some troubleshooters refer to this strategy as &quot;divide and conquer,&quot; because it divides the possibilities of fault location by a factor of 2 with each step.</p>
<p>It is important to realize in situations such as this that no determination of faultlessness in the circuit has been made yet. By measuring 0 volts between points C and H, we know there is a definite problem in the left half of the circuit, but we have by no means &quot;cleared&quot; the right half of the circuit of any fault. For all we know, there may be faults in <em>both</em> halves of the circuit! Only further investigation will reveal the truth.</p>
