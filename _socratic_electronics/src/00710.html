<p>Describe what will happen to the impedance of both the capacitor and the resistor as the input signal frequency increases:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00710x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Also, describe what result the change in impedances will have on the op-amp circuitâ€™s voltage gain. If the input signal amplitude remains constant as frequency increases, what will happen to the amplitude of the output voltage? What type of filtering function does this behavior represent?</p>
<p>As the frequency of <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>i</em><em>n</em></sub></span> increases, <span class="math"><em>Z</em><sub><em>C</em></sub></span> decreases and <span class="math"><em>Z</em><sub><em>R</em></sub></span> remains unchanged. This will result in a decreased <span class="math"><em>A</em><sub><em>V</em></sub></span> for the amplifier circuit.</p>
<p>Challenge question: explain why this type of circuit is usually equipped with a high-value resistor (<span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span>) in parallel with the feedback capacitor:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00710x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>This same op-amp circuit is known by a particular name when used with DC input signals. Ask your students what this design of circuit is called. When receiving a DC input signal, what function does it serve? The answer to this is key to answering the &quot;challenge&quot; question.</p>
