<p>Ohm’s Law tells us that the amount of current through a fixed resistance may be calculated as such:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$I = {E \over R}$</span><br /></p>
<p>We could also express this relationship in terms of <em>conductance</em> rather than <em>resistance</em>, knowing that <span class="math">$G = {1 \over R}$</span>:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math"><em>I</em> = <em>E</em><em>G</em></span><br /></p>
<p>However, the relationship between current and voltage for a fixed capacitance is quite different. The &quot;Ohm’s Law&quot; formula for a capacitor is as such:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$i = C {de \over dt}$</span><br /></p>
<p>What significance is there in the use of lower-case variables for current (<span class="math"><em>i</em></span>) and voltage (<span class="math"><em>e</em></span>)? Also, what does the expression <span class="math">${de \over dt}$</span> mean? Note: in case you think that the <span class="math"><em>d</em></span>’s are variables, and should cancel out in this fraction, think again: this is no ordinary quotient! The <span class="math"><em>d</em></span> letters represent a calculus concept known as a <em>differential</em>, and a quotient of two <span class="math"><em>d</em></span> terms is called a <em>derivative</em>.</p>
<p>Lower-case variables represent <em>instantaneous</em> values, as opposed to average values. The expression <span class="math">${de \over dt}$</span>, which may also be written as <span class="math">${dv \over dt}$</span>, represents the <em>instantaneous rate of change of voltage over time</em>.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: manipulate this equation to solve for the other two variables (<span class="math">${de \over dt} = \cdots$</span> ; <span class="math"><em>C</em> = ⋯</span>).</p>
<p>I have found that the topics of capacitance and inductance are excellent contexts in which to introduce fundamental principles of calculus to students. The time you spend discussing this question and questions like it will vary according to your students’ mathematical abilities.</p>
<p>Even if your students are not ready to explore calculus, it is still a good idea to discuss how the relationship between current and voltage for a capacitance involves <em>time</em>. This is a radical departure from the time-independent nature of resistors, and of Ohm’s Law!</p>
