<p>Design a passive integrator circuit using a resistor and <em>inductor</em> rather than a resistor and capacitor:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01897x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01897x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>In addition to completing the inductor circuit schematic, qualitatively state the preferred values of <span class="math"><em>L</em></span> and <span class="math"><em>R</em></span> to achieve an output waveform most resembling a true triangle wave. In other words, are we looking for a large or small inductor; a large or small resistor?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01897x03.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>For maximum &quot;triangle-like&quot; waveshape, choose a large value for <span class="math"><em>L</em></span> and a small value for <span class="math"><em>R</em></span>.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: explain how the choices of values for <span class="math"><em>L</em></span> and <span class="math"><em>R</em></span> follow the same reasoning as the choices for <span class="math"><em>R</em></span> and <span class="math"><em>C</em></span> in an RC passive integrator circuit.</p>
<p>Explain to your students that although LR integrator circuits are possible, they are almost never used. RC circuits are much more practical. Ask them to determine why this is!</p>
