<p>When an SCR latches &quot;on,&quot; it drops very little voltage between anode and cathode. Explain why this is, and what advantage this gives SCRs over transistors when conducting heavy load currents.</p>
<p>The constituent transistors of an SCR become driven heavily into saturation in its conductive state, with a bare minimum of drive (gate) current necessary.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: how does the internal operation of an SCR explain its very fast turn-on time, in addition to explaining its low conducting voltage drop?</p>
<p>The key to fully answering why an SCR drives itself so hard during conduction is found in the principle of <em>positive feedback</em>. Discuss this principle with your students if they have not already studied it. If they have already studied it, use this question as an opportunity for review.</p>
