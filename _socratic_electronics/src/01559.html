<p>Special types of vectors called <em>phasors</em> are often used to depict the magnitude and phase-shifts of sinusoidal AC voltages and currents. Suppose that the following phasors represent the series summation of two AC voltages, one with a magnitude of 3 volts and the other with a magnitude of 4 volts:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01559x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Explain what each of the following phasor diagrams represents, in electrical terms:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01559x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Also explain the significance of these sums: that we may obtain three <em>different</em> values of total voltage (7 volts, 1 volt, or 5 volts) from the same series-connected AC voltages. What does this mean for us as we prepare to analyze AC circuits using the rules we learned for DC circuits?</p>
<p>Each of the phasor diagrams represents two AC voltages being added together. The dotted phasor represents the sum of the 3-volt and 4-volt signals, for different conditions of phase shift between them.</p>
<p>Please note that these three possibilities are not exhaustive! There are a multitude of other possible total voltages that the series-connected 3 volt and 4 volt sources may create.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: in DC circuits, it is permissible to connect multiple voltage sources in parallel, so long as the voltages (magnitudes) and polarities are the same. Is this also true for AC? Why or why not?</p>
<p>Be sure to discuss with your students that these three conditions shown are not the only conditions possible! I simply chose 0<span class="math">$^{o}$</span>, 180<span class="math">$^{o}$</span>, and 90<span class="math">$^{o}$</span> because they all resulted in round sums for the given quantities.</p>
<p>The follow-up question previews an important subject concerning AC phase: the necessary <em>synchronization</em> or paralleled AC voltage sources.</p>
