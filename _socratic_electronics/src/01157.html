<p>Find one or two relays and bring them with you to class for discussion. Identify as much information as you can about your relays prior to discussion:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Coil voltage</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Coil resistance</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Number of switch poles</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Number of switch throws</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Voltage rating of contacts</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Current rating of contacts</p>
<p>Also, calculate the amount of current that will be drawn by the coil when energized.</p>
<p>If possible, find a manufacturer’s datasheet for your components (or at least a datasheet for a similar component) to discuss with your classmates.</p>
<p>If your relay’s coil is designed for AC voltage rather than DC voltage, the amount of current drawn by it will be far less than what you have calculated by using Ohm’s Law, due to a property of coils known as <em>inductive reactance</em>.</p>
<p>The purpose of this question is to get students to kinesthetically interact with the subject matter. It may seem silly to have students engage in a &quot;show and tell&quot; exercise, but I have found that activities such as this greatly help some students. For those learners who are kinesthetic in nature, it is a great help to actually <em>touch</em> real components while they’re learning about their function. Of course, this question also provides an excellent opportunity for them to practice interpreting component markings, use a multimeter, access datasheets, etc.</p>
