<p>Plain S-R latch circuits are &quot;set&quot; by activating the <span class="math"><em>S</em></span> input and de-activating the <span class="math"><em>R</em></span> input. Conversely, they are &quot;reset&quot; by activating the <span class="math"><em>R</em></span> input and de-activating the <span class="math"><em>S</em></span> input. Gated latches and flip-flops, however, are a little more complex:</p>

<p>Describe what input conditions have to be present to force each of these multivibrator circuits to <em>set</em> and to <em>reset</em>.</p>
<p>For the S-R gated latch:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Set by . . .</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Reset by . . .</p>
<p>For the S-R flip-flop:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Set by . . .</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Reset by . . .</p>
<p>For the S-R gated latch:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Set by making <span class="math"><em>S</em></span> high, <span class="math"><em>R</em></span> low, and <span class="math"><em>E</em></span> high.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Reset by making <span class="math"><em>R</em></span> high, <span class="math"><em>S</em></span> low, and <span class="math"><em>E</em></span> high.</p>
<p>For the S-R flip-flop:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Set by making <span class="math"><em>S</em></span> high, <span class="math"><em>R</em></span> low, and <span class="math"><em>C</em></span> transition from low to high.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Reset by making <span class="math"><em>R</em></span> high, <span class="math"><em>S</em></span> low, and <span class="math"><em>C</em></span> transition from low to high.</p>
<p>The purpose of this question is to review the definitions of &quot;set&quot; and &quot;reset,&quot; as well as to differentiate latches from flip-flops.</p>
