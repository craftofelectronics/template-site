<p>In this automatic cooling fan circuit, a comparator is used to turn a DC motor on and off when the sensed temperature reaches the &quot;setpoint&quot; established by the potentiometer:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00877x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The circuit works just as it is supposed to in turning the motor on and off, but it has a strange problem: the transistor gets warm when the motor is <em>off</em>! Oddly enough, the transistor actually cools down when the motor turns on.</p>
<p>Describe what you would measure first in troubleshooting this problem. Based on the particular model of op-amp used (a model LM741C), what do you suspect is the problem here?</p>
<p>The problem here is that the model 741 op-amp cannot &quot;swing&quot; its output rail-to-rail. An op-amp with rail-to-rail output voltage capability would not make the transistor heat up in the &quot;off&quot; mode.</p>
<p>Challenge question: what purpose does the capacitor serve in this circuit? Hint: the capacitor is not required in a &quot;perfect world,&quot; but it helps eliminate spurious problems in the real world!</p>
<p>Iâ€™ve actually encountered this transistor heating problem in designing and building a very similar DC motor control circuit using the 741. There is a way to overcome this problem without switching to a different model of op-amp!</p>
<p>After discussing the nature of the problem with your students, you should talk about the virtues of getting a &quot;low performance&quot; op-amp such as the model 741 to work in a scenario like this rather than changing to an op-amp model capable of rail-to-rail operation. In my estimation, switching to a more modern op-amp in a circuit as simple as this is &quot;cheating&quot;. There is nothing about this circuit that fundamentally taxes the capabilities of a 741 op-amp. All it takes is a little creativity to make it work properly.</p>
