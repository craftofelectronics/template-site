<p>Electrical inductance has a close mechanical analogy: <em>inertia</em>. Explain what mechanical &quot;inertia&quot; is, and how the quantities of velocity and force applied to an object with mass are respectively analogous to current and voltage applied to an inductance.</p>
<p>As an object is subjected to a constant, unbalanced force, its velocity changes at a linear rate:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$F = m{dv \over dt}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Where,</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>F</em> = </span> Net force applied to object</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>m</em> = </span> Mass of object</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>v</em> = </span> Velocity of object</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>t</em> = </span> Time</p>
<p>In a similar manner, a pure inductance experiencing a constant voltage will exhibit a constant rate of current change over time:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$e = L{di \over dt}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Explain to your students how the similarities between inertia and inductance are so close, that inductors can be used to electrically model mechanical inertia.</p>
