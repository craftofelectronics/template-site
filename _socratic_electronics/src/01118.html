<p>Suppose two engineers were debating where to place a potentiometer in this audio amplifier circuit, to be used as a volume control:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01118x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Which option would be better, and why? What ill effects could result from locating the potentiometer in the wrong place in this circuit?</p>
<p>Option #1 is definitely the better choice, because the potentiometerâ€™s setting will not affect the biasing of <span class="math"><em>Q</em><sub>2</sub></span> as it would in option #2.</p>
<p>The purpose of this question is to make students realize that the biasing of each transistor stage is important in a multi-stage amplifier. One of the major challenges of designing a multi-stage amplifier is to ensure adequate signal coupling between stages without creating bias problems.</p>
