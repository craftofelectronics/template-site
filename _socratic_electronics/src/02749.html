<p>Just as certain assumptions are often made for bipolar transistors in order to simplify their analysis in circuits (an ideal BJT has negligible base current, <span class="math"><em>I</em><sub><em>C</em></sub> = <em>I</em><sub><em>E</em></sub></span>, constant <span class="math"><em>β</em></span>, etc.), we often make assumptions about operational amplifiers so we may more easily analyze their behavior in closed-loop circuits. Identify some of these ideal opamp assumptions as they relate to the following parameters:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Magnitude of input terminal currents:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Input impedance:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Output impedance:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Input voltage range:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Output voltage range:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Differential voltage (between input terminals) with negative feedback:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Magnitude of input terminal currents: <em>infinitesimal</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Input impedance: <em>infinite</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Output impedance: <em>infinitesimal</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Input voltage range: <em>never exceeding +V/-V</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Output voltage range: <em>never exceeding +V/-V</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Differential voltage (between input terminals) with negative feedback: <em>infinitesimal</em></p>
<p>Just in case your students are unfamiliar with the words <em>infinite</em> and <em>infinitesimal</em>, tell them they simply mean &quot;bigger than big&quot; and &quot;smaller than small&quot;, respectively.</p>
