<p>What is the proper unit of measurement for the transconductance of a field-effect transistor (or an electron tube, which exhibits similar characteristics)? Explain why this unit makes sense, based on the mathematical definition of transconductance.</p>
<p>Transconductance is measured in <em>Siemens</em> or <em>mhos</em>, the former unit being the official metric designation, and that latter being an older designation.</p>
<p>Although the physical meaning of transconductance (<span class="math"><em>g</em><sub><em>m</em></sub></span>) is significantly different from the physical meaning of conductance (<span class="math"><em>G</em></span>), they share the same unit of measurement due to their respective mathematical definitions. Discuss the concept of <em>dimensional analysis</em> with your students if they have not yet been exposed to it thus far through their use of physics formulae.</p>
