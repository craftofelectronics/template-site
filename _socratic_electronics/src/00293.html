<p>The circuit shown here is commonly referred to as a <em>voltage divider</em>. Calculate the voltage dropped across the following pairs of terminals, the current through each resistor, and the total amount of electrical resistance &quot;seen&quot; by the 9-volt battery:</p>

<p>Can you think of any practical applications for a circuit such as this?</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Voltage between terminals 2 and 3 = 1.8 volts</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Voltage between terminals 4 and 5 = 2.7 volts</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Voltage between terminals 6 and 7 = 4.5 volts</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Voltage between terminals 6 and 8 = 4.5 volts</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Voltage between terminals 4 and 8 = 7.2 volts</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Voltage between terminals 2 and 8 = 9 volts</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Current through each resistor = 0.9 mA</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>t</em><em>o</em><em>t</em><em>a</em><em>l</em></sub></span> = 10 k<span class="math">Ω </span></p>
<p>Note how all the voltage drops are a certain <em>proportion</em> of the total voltage. What do you think would happen to these voltage drops if the source voltage (9 volts from the battery) were doubled?</p>
<p>Some students may find the diagram hard to follow, and so they will find the task of analysis helped by drawing an equivalent schematic diagram for this circuit, with all terminal points labeled. I recommend you not suggest this solution immediately, but rather challenge your students to think of problem-solving techniques on their own. Surely, someone in the class will have thought of doing this, and the impact of such a suggestion coming from a peer is greater than if it came from you, the instructor.</p>
<p>Be sure to ask your students this question: &quot;Why is this type of circuit commonly called a <em>voltage divider</em>?&quot;</p>
