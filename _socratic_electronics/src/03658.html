<p>Explain why it is very important never to open-circuit the secondary winding of a <em>current transformer</em> (CT).</p>
<p>Current transformers tend to act like current sources when in operation, meaning that they can and will develop extremely large secondary voltages in an attempt to push finite current through large resistances (such as an air gap).</p>
