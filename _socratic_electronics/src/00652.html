<p>Calculate the power dissipated by a 25 <span class="math">Ω </span> resistor, when powered by a square-wave with a symmetrical amplitude of 100 volts and a frequency of 2 kHz, through a 0.22 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>F capacitor:</p>

<p>No, I’m not asking you to calculate an infinite number of terms in the Fourier series – that would be cruel and unusual. Just calculate the power dissipated in the resistor by the 1st, 3rd, 5th, and 7th harmonics only.</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>P</em><sub><em>R</em>(1<em>s</em><em>t</em>)</sub> = </span> 1.541 watts</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>P</em><sub><em>R</em>(3<em>r</em><em>d</em>)</sub> = </span> 1.485 watts</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>P</em><sub><em>R</em>(5<em>t</em><em>h</em>)</sub> = </span> 1.384 watts</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>P</em><sub><em>R</em>(7<em>t</em><em>h</em>)</sub> = </span> 1.255 watts</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>P</em><sub><em>R</em>(1 + 3 + 5 + 7)</sub> = </span> 5.665 watts</p>
<p>To calculate this power figure, students have to research the Fourier series for a square wave. Many textbooks use square waves to introduce the subject of Fourier series, so this should not be difficult for students to find.</p>
<p>Ask your students how the real power dissipated by this resistor compares with the final figure of 5.665 watts. Is the real power dissipation more, less, or equal to this figure? If not equal, what would we have to do to arrive at a more precise figure?</p>
