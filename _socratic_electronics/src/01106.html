<p>The output voltage of a buck converter is a direct function of the switching transistor’s duty cycle. Specifically, <span class="math">$V_{out} = V_{in}\bigl({t_{on} \over t_{total}}\bigr)$</span>. Explain how the following PWM control circuit regulates the output voltage of the buck converter:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01106x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>If the load (output) voltage sags, the PWM circuit generates an output signal with a greater duty cycle, which then drives the power transistor to provide more voltage to the load.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: what is the purpose of the potentiometer in this circuit?</p>
<p>Here, students see a PWM control circuit coupled with a buck converter to provide <em>voltage-regulated</em> power conversion. Ask them what form of feedback (positive or negative?) is used in this circuit to regulate the output voltage at a steady value.</p>
<p>Let your students know that the PWM and feedback functions for switching regulator circuits are often provided in a single, application-specific integrated circuit rather than by a collection of discrete components and IC’s as shown in the question.</p>
