<p>The following is an internal schematic of a CMOS logic gate. Based on your analysis of the transistor circuit, determine what type of gate (AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR, etc.) it is:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01272x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>This is a NOR gate.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: identify a series of &quot;thought experiments&quot; you could perform on this circuit schematic to determine the identity of the gate. In other words, document what imagined conditions you would subject this gate to, and what the resulting output states would signify, in answering the question of what type of gate this is.</p>
<p>CMOS logic gate circuits are the easiest of all the gates to analyze internally! Discuss with your students why the second-from-the-top MOSFET uses an independent substrate connection (as opposed to making it common with the source, as usual).</p>
