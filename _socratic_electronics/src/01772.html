<p>What would happen to the voltage drops across each resistor in this circuit if either resistor R2 or R3 were to fail open?</p>

<p>If either resistor R2 or R3 were to fail open (internally), the voltage across both R2 <em>and</em> R3 would increase (but not to full battery voltage), leaving less voltage dropped across R1.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: explain why it doesn’t matter which resistor (R2 or R3) fails open – the <em>qualitative</em> results for voltage (voltage increasing or decreasing, but not by any specific amount) will be the same.</p>
<p>I have found in teaching that many students loathe qualitative analysis, because they cannot let their calculators do the thinking for them. However, being able to judge whether a circuit parameter will increase, decrease, or remain the same after a component fault is an <em>essential</em> skill for proficient troubleshooting.</p>
