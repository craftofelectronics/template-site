<p>Plot the transfer function (<span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>o</em><em>u</em><em>t</em></sub></span> versus <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>i</em><em>n</em></sub></span>) for this opamp circuit, and explain how the circuit works:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01016x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>What type of mathematical function is represented by this circuit?</p>
<p>This circuit represents a <em>logarithmic</em> function (<span class="math"><em>y</em> ∝ ln<em>x</em></span>):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01016x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The direction of the transfer function curve may surprise some students. Ask them why the curve goes down (negative) for increasingly positive input voltages.</p>
<p>Ask your students how they obtained this transfer function curve. There are conceptual methods for obtaining it, as well as algebraic methods. It would be interesting to compare more than one of these methods in a class discussion, and have students gain insight from each others’ methods.</p>
