<p>What type of substance(s) must be added to an intrinsic semiconductor in order to produce &quot;donor&quot; electrons? When this is done, how do we denote this type of &quot;doped&quot; semiconducting substance?</p>
<p>Likewise, what type of substance(s) must be added to an intrinsic semiconductor in order to produce &quot;acceptor&quot; holes? When this is done, how to we denote this type of &quot;doped&quot; semiconducting substance?</p>
<p>To create donor electrons, you must add a substance with a greater number of valence electrons than the base semiconductor material. When this is done, it is called an <strong>N-type</strong> semiconductor.</p>
<p>To create acceptor holes, you must add a substance with a lesser number of valence electrons than the base semiconductor material. When this is done, it is called a <strong>P-type</strong> semiconductor.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: identify some common &quot;donor&quot; (N-type) and &quot;acceptor&quot; (P-type) dopants.</p>
<p>When doping silicon and germanium substrates, the materials used are classified as either <em>pentavalent</em> or <em>trivalent</em> substances. Ask your students which one of these terms refers to the greater valence number, and which refers to the lesser valence number.</p>
