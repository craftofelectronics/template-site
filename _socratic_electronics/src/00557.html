<p>What does it mean to <em>tin</em> a piece of wire prior to making a soldered connection with it?</p>
<p>&quot;Tinning&quot; is the act of pre-soldering the bare wire end, so that its appearance is like solder instead of copper.</p>
<p>Some wire may be purchase &quot;pre-tinned&quot; to save you this step, but most electrical wire is not. Here is a helpful hint: tinning the ends of a piece of stranded copper wire really helps to prevent individual strands from bending and breaking away when the wire end is clamped in a terminal strip!</p>
