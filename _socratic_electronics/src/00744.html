<p>Describe the operating principles of these three methods for starting single-phase induction motors:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Shaded pole</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Split-phase, capacitor</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Split-phase (resistor or inductor)</p>
<p>In each of these techniques, a &quot;trick&quot; is used to create a truly rotating magnetic field from what would normally be a reciprocating (single-phase) magnetic field. The &quot;shaded pole&quot; technique is magnetic, while the other two techniques use phase-shifting. I will leave research of the details up to you.</p>
<p>There are many details which can be discussed with students regarding these methods of single-phase motor starting. Thankfully, there are many good-quality sources of information on single-phase motor theory and construction, so finding information on this topic will not be difficult for your students.</p>
