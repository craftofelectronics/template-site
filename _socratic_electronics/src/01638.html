<p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE:</strong> do not actually try to connect the ammeter improperly in the circuit, as the meter may be damaged in the process!</p>
<p>Connect the ammeter in <em>series</em> with the component whose current is to be measured.</p>
<p>The purpose of this exercise is to make absolutely sure students can safely measure current with a multimeter.</p>
<p>A good extension of this assessment is to have students demonstrate competency using both digital and analog multimeters!</p>
