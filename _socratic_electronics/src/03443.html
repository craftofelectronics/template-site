<p>Although the voltage divider and current divider equations are very useful in circuit analysis, they are easily confused for one another because they look so similar:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$V_R = V_{total}\left( {R \over R_{total}} \right) \hbox{\hskip 100pt} I_R = I_{total}\left( {R_{total} \over R} \right)$</span><br /></p>
<p>Specifically, it is easy to forget which way the resistance fraction goes for each one. Is it <span class="math">${R \over R_{total}}$</span> or is it <span class="math">${R_{total} \over R}$</span> ? Simply trying to memorize which fraction form goes with which equation is a bad policy, since memorization of arbitrary forms tends to be unreliable. What is needed is recognition of some sort of <em>principle</em> that makes the form of each equation sensible. In other words, each equation needs to make sense <em>why</em> it is the way it is.</p>
<p>Explain how one would be able to tell that the following equations are wrong, without referring to a book:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$V_R = V_{total}\left( {R_{total} \over R} \right) \hbox{\hskip 20pt {\bf Wrong equations!} \hskip 20pt} I_R = I_{total}\left( {R \over R_{total}} \right)$</span><br /></p>
<p>The resistance fraction must always be less than 1.</p>
<p>Note that I do not explain why the fraction is less than 1 for each equation. I leave it to the students to figure out that <span class="math"><em>R</em> &lt; <em>R</em><sub><em>t</em><em>o</em><em>t</em><em>a</em><em>l</em></sub></span> for series circuits and <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>t</em><em>o</em><em>t</em><em>a</em><em>l</em></sub> &lt; <em>R</em></span> for parallel circuits.</p>
<p>Many students have the unfortunate tendency to <em>memorize</em> in favor of <em>understand</em>, especially when it comes to equations. Comprehension is, of course, far superior, and exercises like this one help students build comprehension of the formulae they use in electronics.</p>
