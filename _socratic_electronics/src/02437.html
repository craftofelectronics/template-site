<p>Choose a power supply voltage and resistance value for <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> that will maintain approximately 15 mA of current through the 1 k<span class="math">Ω </span> load resistor. Assume the use of a silicon transistor:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02437x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>To ensure plenty of regulation range (the ability to maintain regulated current over a wide range of load resistance values), design your circuit so that at least 20 volts <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>C</em><em>E</em></sub></span> are dropped across transistor <span class="math"><em>Q</em><sub>2</sub></span>. Also, calculate the approximate power dissipation of transistor <span class="math"><em>Q</em><sub>2</sub></span>.</p>
<p>Note that this is just one possible set of values meeting the criteria given for this circuit. Your own answers may be different!</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> = 2.287 k<span class="math">Ω </span> <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>s</em><em>u</em><em>p</em><em>p</em><em>l</em><em>y</em></sub></span> = 35 volts <span class="math"><em>P</em><sub><em>Q</em>2</sub> ≈ </span> 300 mW</p>
<p>Since there is more than one current answer for this design problem, be sure to ask students to present different solutions to it, asking them to explain how they obtained their answers to this question.</p>
