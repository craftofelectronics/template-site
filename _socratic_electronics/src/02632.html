<p>Identify the type of oscillator circuit shown in this schematic diagram, and explain the purpose of the tank circuit (<span class="math"><em>L</em><sub>1</sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>C</em><sub>1</sub></span>):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02632x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Also, write the equation describing the operating frequency of this type of oscillator circuit.</p>
<p>This is a <em>Meissner</em> oscillator circuit, and the tank circuit establishes its frequency of operation.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$f = {1 \over {2 \pi \sqrt{L_1 C_1}}}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Ask your students to describe the amount of phase shift the tank circuit provides to the feedback signal. Also, ask them to explain how the oscillator circuitâ€™s natural frequency may be altered.</p>
<p>This circuit is unusual, as inductors <span class="math"><em>L</em><sub>2</sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>L</em><sub>3</sub></span> are not coupled to each other, but each is coupled to tank circuit inductor <span class="math"><em>L</em><sub>1</sub></span>.</p>
