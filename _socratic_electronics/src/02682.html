<p>Examine the following progression of mathematical statements:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">(10<sup>2</sup>)(10<sup>3</sup>) = 100000</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">10<sup>2 + 3</sup> = 100000</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">10<sup>5</sup> = 100000</span><br /></p>
<p>What does this pattern indicate? What principle of algebra is illustrated by these three equations?</p>
<p>Next, examine this progression of mathematical statements:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">log10<sup>5</sup> = log100000 = 5</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">log10<sup>2 + 3</sup> = log100000 = 5</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">log10<sup>2</sup> + log10<sup>3</sup> = log100000 = 5</span><br /></p>
<p>What does this pattern indicate? What principle of algebra is illustrated by these three equations?</p>
<p>First pattern:</p>
<p>The product of two base numbers with different exponents is equal to that base number raised to the power of the exponents’ sum.</p>
<p>Second pattern:</p>
<p>The sum of two logarithms is equal to the logarithm of those two numbers’ product.</p>
<p>In this question, I want students to begin to see how logarithms relate multiplication to addition, and how powers relate addition to multiplication. This is an initial step to students recognizing logarithms as <em>transform functions</em>: a means to transform one type of mathematical problem into a simpler type of mathematical problem.</p>
