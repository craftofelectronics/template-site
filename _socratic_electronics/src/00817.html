<p>In order to make the most practical AC generator (or <em>alternator</em>, as it is also known), which design makes more sense: a stationary permanent magnet with a rotating wire coil, or a rotating permanent magnet with a stationary wire coil? Explain your choice.</p>
<p>It is more practical by far to build an alternator with a stationary wire coil and a rotating magnet than to build one with a stationary magnet and a rotating wire coil, because a machine with a rotating coil would require some form of <em>brushes</em> and <em>slip rings</em> to conduct power from the rotating shaft to the load.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: what is so bad about brushes and slip rings that we want to avoid them in alternator design if possible?</p>
<p>Answering the follow-up question may require a bit of research on the part of your students. Ask them to describe what &quot;brushes&quot; are and what &quot;slip rings&quot; are, and then the mechanical wearing aspects of these parts should become plain.</p>
