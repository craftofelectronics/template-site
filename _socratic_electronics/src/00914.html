<p>Are the collector and emitter terminals of a transistor interchangeable? If not, what is the physical difference between the emitter and collector?</p>
<p>The emitter is smaller and more heavily &quot;doped&quot; than the collector.</p>
<p>Ask your students if there is any way to distinguish the emitter and collector terminals on a transistor, from external meter measurements. There is!</p>
