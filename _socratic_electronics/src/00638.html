<p>Voltage divider circuits may be constructed from reactive components just as easily as they may be constructed from resistors. Take this capacitive voltage divider, for instance:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00638x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Calculate the magnitude and phase shift of <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>o</em><em>u</em><em>t</em></sub></span>. Also, describe what advantages a capacitive voltage divider might have over a resistive voltage divider.</p>
<p><span class="math">${\bf V_{out}}$</span> = 1.754 V <span class="math">∠</span> 0<span class="math">$^{o}$</span></p>
<p>Follow-up question #1: explain why the division ratio of a capacitive voltage divider remains constant with changes in signal frequency, even though we know that the reactance of the capacitors (<span class="math"><em>X</em><sub><em>C</em>1</sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>X</em><sub><em>C</em>2</sub></span>) will change.</p>
<p>Follow-up question #2: one interesting feature of capacitive voltage dividers is that they harbor the possibility of electric shock after being disconnected from the voltage source, if the source voltage is high enough and if the disconnection happens at just the right time. Explain why a capacitive voltage divider poses this threat whereas a resistive voltage divider does not. Also, identify what the <em>time</em> of disconnection from the AC voltage source has to do with shock hazard.</p>
<p>Capacitive voltage dividers find use in high-voltage AC instrumentation, due to some of the advantages they exhibit over resistive voltage dividers. Your students should take special note of the phase angle for the capacitor’s voltage drop. Why it is 0 degrees, and not some other angle?</p>
