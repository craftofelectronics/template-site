<p>Operational amplifiers have two input terminals rather than just one as &quot;normal&quot; single-ended amplifier circuits do. Among other things, this means operational amplifiers must deal with <em>common-mode</em> voltage as well as <em>differential</em> voltage. Give a definition for &quot;common-mode&quot; voltage.</p>
<p>&quot;Common-mode&quot; voltage is that voltage <em>common</em> to both input terminals.</p>
