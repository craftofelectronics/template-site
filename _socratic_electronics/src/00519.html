<p>Identify some common &quot;primary&quot; cell types, as well as some common &quot;secondary&quot; cell types. For each of these battery types, identify their standard output voltages.</p>
<p>Primary cell types and voltages:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Carbon-zinc: 1.5 volts</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Alkaline: 1.5 volts</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Lithium: 1.8 to 3.65 volts, depending on exact chemical makeup</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Mercuric-oxide: 1.35 to 1.4 volts</p>
<p>Secondary cell types and voltages:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Lead-acid: 2.1 volts</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Nickel-cadmium: 1.2 volts</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Silver-zinc: 1.5 volts</p>
<p>Follow-up question: what are some of the safety and environmental concerns regarding the chemical substances used in batteries, both primary and secondary types?</p>
<p>Challenge your students to list a few cell types other than what is listed in the answer section.</p>
<p>Note: data for typical cell output voltages taken from chapter 20 of the <em>Electronic Engineer’s Reference Book</em>, 5th edition (edited by F. Mazda).</p>
