<p>Calculate the amount of time it takes for a 33 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>F capacitor to charge from 0 volts to 20 volts, if powered by a 24 volt battery through a 10 k<span class="math">Ω </span> resistor.</p>
<p>0.591 seconds</p>
<p>In order for students to solve this problem, they must algebraically manipulate the &quot;normal&quot; time-constant formula to solve for time instead of solving for voltage.</p>
