<p>Calculate the amount of MMF (<span class="math">$\cal F$</span>) generated by a coil of wire having 1300 turns and carrying 3.5 milliamperes of current.</p>
<p><span class="math">$\cal F$</span> = 4.55 amp-turns</p>
<p>Nothing special here, just a simple calculation. One of the points of this question is to have students research the formula for calculating <span class="math">$\cal F$</span>, as simple as it is.</p>
