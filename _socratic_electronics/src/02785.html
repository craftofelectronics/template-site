<p>Convert the following relay logic circuit into a Boolean expression, writing Boolean sub-expressions next to each relay coil and lamp in the diagram:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02785x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02785x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The process of converting relay logic circuits into Boolean expressions is not quite as simple as it is converting gate circuits into Boolean expressions, but it is manageable. Have your students share whatever methods or &quot;tricks&quot; they use to write the expressions with the rest of the class.</p>
