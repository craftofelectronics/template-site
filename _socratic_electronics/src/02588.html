<p>Use circuit simulation software to verify your predicted and measured parameter values.</p>
<p>I also recommend having students use an oscilloscope to measure AC voltage in a circuit such as this, because some digital multimeters have difficulty accurately measuring AC voltage much beyond line frequency range. I find it particularly helpful to set the oscilloscope to the &quot;X-Y&quot; mode so that it draws a thin line on the screen rather than sweeps across the screen to show an actual waveform. This makes it easier to measure peak-to-peak voltage.</p>
<p>Values that have proven to work well for this exercise are given here, although of course many other values are possible:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> +V = +12 volts</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> -V = -12 volts</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> = 10 k<span class="math">Ω </span></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span> = 10 k<span class="math">Ω </span></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>3</sub></span> = 5 k<span class="math">Ω </span> (actually, two 10 k<span class="math">Ω </span> resistors in parallel)</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>4</sub></span> = 100 k<span class="math">Ω </span></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math"><em>C</em><sub>1</sub></span> = 0.001 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>F</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math"><em>C</em><sub>2</sub></span> = 0.001 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>F</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math"><em>C</em><sub>3</sub></span> = 0.002 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>F (actually, two 0.001 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>F capacitors in parallel)</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math"><em>U</em><sub>1</sub></span> = one-half of LM1458 dual operational amplifier</p>
<p>This combination of components gave a predicted center frequency of 15.92 kHz, with an actual cutoff frequency (not factoring in component tolerances) of 15.63 kHz.</p>
