<p>A 5 H inductor is subjected to an electric current that changes at a rate of 4.5 amps per second. How much voltage will be dropped by the inductor?</p>
<p>This inductor will drop 22.5 volts.</p>
<p>Don’t give your students the equation with which to perform this calculation! Let them find it on their own. The <span class="math">${di \over dt}$</span> notation may be foreign to students lacking a strong mathematical background, but don’t let this be an obstacle to learning! Rather, use this as a way to introduce those students to the concept of <em>rates of change</em>, and to the calculus concept of the <em>derivative</em>.</p>
