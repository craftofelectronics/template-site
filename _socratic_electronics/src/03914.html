<p>Suppose OR gate <span class="math"><em>U</em><sub>3</sub></span> were to fail with the output terminal always high. Which output codes would be affected by this fault?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03914x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The following output codes would be adversely affected by this fault: 1, 4, 5, 8, and 9.</p>
<p>Ask your students to explain how they determined the affected codes. Although the question itself is relatively simple, there is room for creativity in the answers!</p>
