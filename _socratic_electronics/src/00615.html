<p>Identify these filters as either being &quot;low-pass&quot; or &quot;high-pass&quot;, and be prepared to explain your answers:</p>

<p>Low-pass and high-pass filter circuit are really easy to identify if you consider the input frequencies in terms of extremes: radio frequency (very high), and DC (<span class="math"><em>f</em> = </span> 0 Hz). Ask your students to identify the respective impedances of all components in a filter circuit for these extreme frequency examples, and the functions of each filter circuit should become very clear to see.</p>
