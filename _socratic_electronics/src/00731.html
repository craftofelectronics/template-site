<p>What will happen to the function of this ammeter circuit, if its resistor were to fail open?</p>

<p>If the resistor were to fail open, the ammeter would become much more sensitive.</p>
<p>Some students may think the ammeter will fail to respond at all with an open resistor, because they associate &quot;open&quot; faults with lack of current, and lack of current with zero response from the meter movement. Careful examination of the circuit, however, reveals that the exact opposite will happen.</p>
