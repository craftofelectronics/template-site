<p>Calculate the voltage gain of this opamp circuit (as a ratio, not decibels):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02717x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math"><em>A</em><sub><em>V</em></sub></span> = 1.467</p>
<p>It is okay if students express this answer as a negative quantity, since some texts teach the gain formula <span class="math">$A_V = -{R_f \over R_i}$</span>.</p>
