<p>Calculate the amount of magnetomotive force (MMF, or <span class="math">$\cal F$</span>) required to establish a magnetic flux (<span class="math">Φ </span>) of 30 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>Wb in a piece of iron having a reluctance (<span class="math">ℜ</span>) of 14 At/Wb.</p>
<p><span class="math">$\cal F$</span> = 420 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>At</p>
<p>Nothing special here, just a simple calculation. One of the points of this question is to have students research Rowland’s Law and learn how to use it as they would Ohm’s Law.</p>
<p>Note that the unit abbreviation for &quot;webers&quot; contains two letters, not just one as is the case for most unit abbreviations!</p>
