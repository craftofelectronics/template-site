<p>Magnetic poles are designated by two labels: &quot;North&quot; and &quot;South&quot;. How are these labels defined? Explain how we can experimentally determine which ends of a magnet are &quot;North&quot; and &quot;South&quot;, respectively?</p>
<p>The end of a magnet that points to the north pole of the Earth is called the &quot;North&quot; pole of the magnet.</p>
<p>After your students explain how to experimentally determine the poles of a magnet, challenge them with this question: given that like poles repel and opposite poles attract, what are the proper magnetic pole designations for the Earthâ€™s actual poles? If the &quot;north&quot; end of a bar magnet orients itself so that it is geographically pointing north, what &quot;magnetic polarity&quot; does the actual North pole of the Earth have?</p>
