<p><em>Time-delay relays</em> are important circuit elements in many applications. Determine what each of the lamps will do in the following circuit when pushbutton &quot;A&quot; is pressed for 10 seconds and then released:</p>

<p>Follow-up question: identify each relay contact by name:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Normally-closed, timed-open</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Normally-open, timed-open</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Normally-closed, timed-close</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Normally-open, timed-close</p>
<p>Time-delay relays are not the easiest for some students to understand. The purpose of this question is to introduce students to the four basic types of time-delay relay contacts and their respective behaviors. Discuss with your students how the contact symbols make sense (arrows on the switch actuators describing direction of delay).</p>
<p>Note to your students how it is possible to have different types of time-delay contacts actuated by the same relay coil.</p>
