<p>The following graph is a family of characteristic curves for a particular transistor:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02244x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Draw the load line and identify the Q-point on that load line for a common-collector amplifier circuit using this transistor:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02244x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02244x03.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Follow-up question: the position of this circuitâ€™s Q-point is approximately mid-way along the load line. Would you say this is indicative of an amplifier biased for Class A operation, or for some other class of operation? Explain your answer.</p>
<p>The purpose of this question is to get students to relate their existing knowledge of common-collector circuit DC analysis to the concept of load lines and Q-points. Ask your students to share their analysis techniques with the whole class.</p>
