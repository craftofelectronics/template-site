<p>Plot the capacitor voltage and the capacitor current over time after the switch closes in this circuit, for at least 4 time constantsâ€™ worth of time:</p>

<p>Be sure to label the axes of your graph!</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00456x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>I intentionally left the graph unscaled in the problem, so that students might determine their own scales to plot the points in. The scaling shown in the answer is obviously not ideal, as the graphs have reached their terminal values (for all practical purposes) well before the horizontal axis is complete.</p>
