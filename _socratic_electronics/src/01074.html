<p>If you have ever used a public address (&quot;PA&quot;) amplifier, where sounds detected by a microphone are amplified and reproduced by speakers, you know how these systems can create &quot;screeching&quot; or &quot;howling&quot; sounds if the microphone is held too close to one of the speakers.</p>
<p>The noise created by a system like this is an example of <em>oscillation</em>: where the amplifier circuit spontaneously outputs an AC voltage, with no external source of AC signal to &quot;drive&quot; it. Explain what necessary condition(s) allow an amplifier to act as an <em>oscillator</em>, using a &quot;howling&quot; PA system as the example. In other words, what exactly is going on in this scenario, that makes an amplifier generate its own AC output signal?</p>
<p>The amplifier receives <em>positive feedback</em> from the output (speaker) to the input (microphone).</p>
<p>Ask your students to define what &quot;positive feedback&quot; is. In what way is the feedback in this system &quot;positive,&quot; and how does this feedback differ from the &quot;negative&quot; variety commonly seen within amplifier circuitry?</p>
