<p>Explain the difference between relative permeability (<span class="math"><em>μ</em><sub><em>r</em></sub></span>) and absolute permeability (<span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>). How do the units of measurement differ between these two quantities?</p>
<p><span class="math">$\mu_r = {\mu \over \mu_0}$</span></p>
<p>Absolute permeability is measured in units of Webers per Amp-meter (Wb/Am), while relative permeability has no unit at all.</p>
<p>Ask your students to explain <em>why</em> relative permeability (<span class="math"><em>μ</em><sub><em>r</em></sub></span>) is unitless. Are there any other variables they’ve encountered in their science studies that are similarly unitless?</p>
<p>Did any of your students research the value of absolute permeability of free space (<span class="math"><em>μ</em><sub>0</sub></span>)? If so, what figure did they obtain?</p>
