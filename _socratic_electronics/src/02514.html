<p>The simplest electronic device capable of converting a current signal into a voltage signal is a resistor:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02514x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Precision resistors typically work very well for this purpose, especially when the amount of voltage dropped across it is of little consequence. This is why <em>shunt resistors</em> are frequently used in power circuitry to measure current, a low-resistance &quot;shunt&quot; resistance element dropping voltage in precise proportion to the current going through it.</p>
<p>However, if we cannot afford to drop any voltage across a resistance in the circuit, this technique of current-to-voltage conversion will not be very practical. Consider the following scientific apparatus, used to measure the photoelectric effect (electrons emitted from a solid surface due to light striking it):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02514x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The current output by such a phototube is <em>very</em> small, and the voltage output by it is smaller yet. If we are to measure current through this device, we will have to find some way other than a shunt resistor to do it.</p>
<p>Enter the operational amplifier, to the rescue! Explain how the following opamp circuit is able to convert the phototubeâ€™s weak current signal into a strong voltage signal, without imposing any significant resistance into the phototube circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02514x03.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The design of this circuit is complicated by the existence of bias currents at the opamp inputs. You may find it helpful to analyze a simplified version of the same circuit. Please bear in mind that this simplified circuit would only work if the opamp had absolutely no input bias currents at all:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02514x04.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Note to your students that this is one of those applications where even &quot;tiny&quot; input bias currents can affect the results. In this particular case, the phototube outputs miniscule current at best, and so we <em>must</em> compensate for the existence of opamp bias currents.</p>
