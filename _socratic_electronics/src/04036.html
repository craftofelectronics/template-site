<p>Euler’s constant, that ubiquitous constant in mathematics symbolized by the letter <span class="math"><em>e</em></span>, may be found as the result of the following mathematical series:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$e = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} {1 \over {n!}}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Approximate the value of <span class="math"><em>e</em></span> in steps, using the following table:</p>
<p><span class="math"></span><span class="math"></span> Also, express this series as a partial sum up to <span class="math"><em>n</em> = 7</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math"></span><span class="math"></span></p>
<p>Shown here is the partial sum up to <span class="math"><em>n</em> = 7</span>:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">${1 \over 0!} + {1 \over 1!} + {1 \over 2!} + {1 \over 3!} + {1 \over 4!} + {1 \over 5!} + {1 \over 6!} + {1 \over 7!}$</span><br /></p>
<p>. . . and again, in slightly different form . . .</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$1 + 1 + {1 \over 2} + {1 \over 6} + {1 \over 24} + {1 \over 120} + {1 \over 720} + {1 \over 5040}$</span><br /></p>
<p>It should go without saying that students should consult their electronic calculators (or a textbook) to see what the actual value of <span class="math"><em>e</em></span> is, and compare that to their partial sum approximation.</p>
<p>This questions provides students with the opportunity to see where <span class="math"><em>e</em></span> comes from, and also to explore the behavior of a series by calculating partial sums. Many students find it fascinating to see the sequence of partial sums converge on the true value of <span class="math"><em>e</em></span>, seeing how this formerly mysterious constant can actually be calculated using nothing more than repeated arithmetic.</p>
