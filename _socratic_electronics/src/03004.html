<p>Here is the block symbol for the 74HC147 decimal-to-BCD encoder:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03004x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Describe what sort of input conditions would be required to make it generate the code for the number 7, and how that numerical quantity would be represented on the output (<span class="math"><em>Y</em></span>) lines.</p>
<p>To encode the number 7, you would have to make the <span class="math"><em>I</em><sub>7</sub></span> line low (connect it to ground). This would make the outputs assume the following states:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math"><em>Y</em><sub>0</sub></span> = low</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math"><em>Y</em><sub>1</sub></span> = low</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math"><em>Y</em><sub>2</sub></span> = low</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math"><em>Y</em><sub>3</sub></span> = high</p>
<p>This is a good review of active-low inputs, how they are drawn on schematics, and what they mean in practical digital circuits. A potentially confusing aspect of this question is the presence of active-low inputs <em>and</em> outputs, but it is well worth your time to review with students, because like it or not there are many ICs with active-low I/O lines.</p>
