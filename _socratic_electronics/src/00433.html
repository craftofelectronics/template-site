<p>If we were to &quot;model&quot; a transistor with a standard passive component (resistor, voltage source, current source, capacitor, or inductor) for the sake of mathematically analyzing a circuit containing a transistor, what component would best represent the characteristics of the transistor within its &quot;active&quot; region?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00433x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>A transistor within its &quot;active&quot; region would be best modeled by a <em>current source</em>.</p>
<p>If your students are perplexed at the method of determining the answer, ask them this question: &quot;For the transistor, what variable remains <em>constant</em> despite a wide variation in the other variable?&quot;</p>
