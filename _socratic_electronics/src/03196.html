<p>It is important to not make resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> too small in value. Explain why, and what might happen if it were.</p>
<p>In the 555â€™s discharge cycle, resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> will drop (almost) the full power supply voltage when <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>p</em><em>o</em><em>t</em>1</sub></span> is set for minimum resistance. Not only could this overheat <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span>, but it could also damage the discharge transistor within the 555 timer.</p>
<p>In order to really understand <em>why</em> insufficient resistance at <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> would be a bad thing, students must understand the astable operating cycle of the 555 timer. This question provides a very practical context in which to explore and/or review it!</p>
