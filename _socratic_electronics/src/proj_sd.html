<hr />
<p>Your project is to build a &quot;sensitive audio detector:&quot; a device useful for detecting low-level electrical signals and expressing them in the form of sound. Here is a sample schematic diagram for you to follow:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{proj_sd1.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>I recommend you follow this design closely, to ensure your detector will function in a safe manner. The headphones should be of the &quot;passive&quot; type, meaning no built-in amplifier or sound controls – just a plain set of 8 <span class="math">Ω </span> closed-cup headphones. If you wish to make any design changes, please consult your instructor.</p>
