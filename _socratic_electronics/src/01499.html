<p>The most important component of your voltmeter will be the galvanometer movement itself. Identify some of the ideal characteristics of this device. For example, what should its full-scale current rating be (very high or very low), and why?</p>
<p>Look for a galvanometer with the lowest full-scale current rating possible (you should be able to obtain meter movements with <span class="math"><em>I</em><sub><em>F</em><em>S</em></sub></span> ratings as low as 50 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>A with little difficulty). Ruggedness is another ideal characteristic, as is a mirrored scale to avoid parallax errors.</p>
<p>I have found a good source of meter movements for students’ own voltmeter projects to be inexpensive analog multimeters. These may be obtained from most tool stores in the United States for $30 or less (2004 prices), and come with multiple scales on the faces, plus mirror bands for anti-parallax reading. General-purpose galvanometer movements may be obtained through wholesale electronics suppliers, but generally not at the same (low) cost as these consumer-grade meters.</p>
<p>It may seem like a shame to purchase a multimeter only to tear it apart and re-build it as a simple voltmeter, but the purpose here is to learn how to design range resistor circuitry and calibrate a meter once it’s built.</p>
