<p>If we apply Ohm’s Law to the calculation of armature current, based on the applied voltage and the known armature winding resistance, we obtain a value for current that <em>far</em> exceeds the value of current measured when the motor is running at speed. Explain why this is.</p>
<p>I won’t directly answer the question here, but I will tell you that the calculated armature current will the same as the actual motor running current <em>if</em> the armature is forcibly stalled (held so that it cannot move). It is only when the armature gains rotational speed that the operating current dramatically decreases: this is your hint.</p>
<p>Once students understand this phenomenon, they will comprehend why electric motors of all kinds draw massive amounts of current when first started (&quot;<em>inrush</em> current&quot;), but do not when running at full speed. Being able to see this first-hand is a great educational experience for most students.</p>
