<p>Use circuit simulation software to verify your predicted and measured parameter values.</p>
<p>You might be surprised to find that <span class="math"><em>L</em><sub><em>t</em><em>o</em><em>t</em><em>a</em><em>l</em></sub> ≠ <em>L</em><sub>1</sub> + <em>L</em><sub>2</sub></span>. This is due to the <em>mutual inductance</em> between inductors <span class="math"><em>L</em><sub>1</sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>L</em><sub>2</sub></span>.</p>
<p>In case students don’t have access to a pair of inductors on a common core, they may either make their own by winding wire around a long ferromagnetic core, or use a center-tapped inductor (or transformer winding). The latter solution is probably the easiest:</p>

<p>Inexpensive audio output transformers (with center-tapped 1000 <span class="math">Ω </span> primary windings) work very well for this. Your students’ parts kits should contain at least one of these transformers anyway if they are to do audio coupling experiments later.</p>
<p>You will need an inductance meter in your lab to do this exercise. If you don’t have one, you should get one right away!</p>
