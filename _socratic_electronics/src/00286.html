<p>Suppose an engineer designed a fire alarm system for a large warehouse, with multiple pushbutton switches connected to a single alarm siren:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00286x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Actuating any of the normally-closed switches results in the alarm sounding. So far, so good.</p>
<p>Now, suppose that one of the wires connecting one side of several switches to the rest of the circuit breaks open. What will the result of this failure be?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00286x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The alarm will immediate sound â€“ a false alarm.</p>
<p>Ask your students what essential task the relay performs in this system. Is there any way to build this circuit to have the same functionality without using a relay?</p>
