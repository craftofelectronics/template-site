<p>Zener diodes are simple and useful devices for building voltage regulator circuits, but are times when you may have to improvise in the absence of the proper zener diode. Explain how normal diodes might be used as crude substitutes for a zener diode in the following circuit:</p>

<p>I have actually done this before in home-made circuitry. Voltage regulation isnâ€™t that good (especially the temperature dependence), but it is better than no regulation at all!</p>
