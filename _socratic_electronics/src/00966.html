<p>Some common-emitter amplifier circuits use <em>partial bypassing</em> of emitter resistance, with the bypass capacitor connected in parallel with only one of two series resistors:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00966x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Explain the purpose of this arrangement. How does this differ in performance from the simple one-resistor emitter feedback design, or a grounded-emitter amplifier with no emitter resistor at all?</p>
<p>This design is a compromise between full bypassing and no emitter resistor at all. It provides all the DC voltage gain and Q-point stability of full bypassing, while providing more AC voltage gain stability than full bypassing.</p>
<p>After reviewing the simple (no-resistor) common-emitter circuit design, and the full-bypass design, it should be apparent to students that this circuit is a hybrid of the two previous designs. Likewise, it should come as little surprise that its performance characteristics lie somewhere between the two previous designs.</p>
