<p>If an electric current is passed through this wire loop, in which position will it try to orient itself?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00261x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>If this experiment is carried out, it may be found that the torque generated is quite small without resorting to high currents and/or strong magnetic fields. Devise a way to modify this apparatus so as to generate stronger torques using modest current levels and ordinary magnets.</p>
<p>The loop will try to orient itself in a vertical plane, perpendicular to the axis of magnetic flux between the magnet poles:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00261x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>To increase the torque generated by the wire loop, you could use a loop with more than 1 &quot;turn&quot; of wire. This is not the only solution, though.</p>
<p>This question presents an excellent opportunity for discussing the &quot;right-hand rule&quot; (or &quot;left-hand rule&quot; for those using electron flow notation rather than conventional flow notation).</p>
