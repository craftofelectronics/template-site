<p>Certain substances are known to physically deform (shorten or lengthen) when an electrical voltage is applied across their length. The effect is known as <em>piezoelectricity</em>. What types of substances are known to be piezoelectric? Identify some possible applications of this phenomenon.</p>
<p>Certain crystal substances, such as <em>quartz</em>, are known to be piezoelectric.</p>
<p>As your students will no doubt discover in their research, piezoelectricity is a two-way effect: physical motion from electricity and visa-versa. It will be clear how well they did their research by the types of applications they think of for the &quot;electricity-to-motion&quot; form of piezoelectricity, given the typical physical scale of piezoelectric displacements.</p>
