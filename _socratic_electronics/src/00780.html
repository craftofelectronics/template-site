<p>What would this permanent-magnet DC motor do, if powered by the following circuit?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00780x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The motor would spin in one direction, at least for a short moment in time. Then, something in the circuit (either the diode or the power supply) would fail due to excessive current!</p>
<p>Follow-up question: identify the polarity of the DC voltage between the motor terminals, during that brief period of time where all component are still functioning.</p>
<p>Ask your students why this circuit is self-destructive. If it functions as a rectifier for powering the DC motor for a short period of time, then why doesnâ€™t it function that way for an indefinite period of time?</p>
