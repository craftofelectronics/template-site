<p>Students new to the study of transistors often have difficulty remembering the proper directions of currents through bipolar junction transistors, since there are three different currents (<span class="math"><em>I</em><sub><em>B</em></sub></span>, <span class="math"><em>I</em><sub><em>C</em></sub></span>, <span class="math"><em>I</em><sub><em>E</em></sub></span>) and they must &quot;mesh&quot; through the transistor in a particular way.</p>
<p>Draw the proper current directions for each of these transistors, and explain how you are able to remember the correct directions they go:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02406x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02406x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Rather than present a &quot;rule of thumb&quot; to use in remembering the proper current directions, I opt to let the students figure this out on their own. An important element of this should be the mathematics of BJT currents, primarily this equation:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math"><em>I</em><sub><em>E</em></sub> = <em>I</em><sub><em>C</em></sub> + <em>I</em><sub><em>B</em></sub></span><br /></p>
<p>This relationship, combined with Kirchhoff’s Current Law, should provide all the help necessary to formulate a rule.</p>
