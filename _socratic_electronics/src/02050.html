<p>Calculate all component voltage drops in this circuit, assuming a supply voltage of 15 volts, an emitter-base forward voltage drop of 0.7 volts, and a (saturated) emitter-collector voltage drop of 0.3 volts:</p>

<p>An interesting point that some students may bring up is the 0.4 volt drop across the base-collector junction. Attentive students will note that this junction is supposed to be reverse-biased, but Kirchhoffâ€™s Voltage Law clearly specifies the polarity of that 0.4 volt drop, and it is in the direction one would expect for <em>forward biasing</em> of that junction. An examination of the energy diagram for a conducting bipolar junction transistor is really necessary to explain why that junction is considered to be reverse-biased.</p>
