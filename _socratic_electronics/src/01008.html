<p>How much current will go &quot;through&quot; the capacitor in this op-amp circuit, and what effect does this have on the output voltage?</p>

<p><span class="math"><em>I</em><sub><em>C</em></sub> = </span> 1.818 mA</p>
<p>This circuit is an <em>integrator</em>: its output voltage changes over time at a rate proportional to the input voltage magnitude.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: what is the output voltage rate-of-change over time (<span class="math">${dv \over dt}$</span>) for the circuit shown in the question?</p>
<p>This question is a good review of capacitor theory (relating voltage and current with regard to a capacitor), as well as an introduction to how op-amp circuits can perform calculus functions.</p>
<p>Challenge your students to calculate the output <span class="math">${dv \over dt}$</span> without using a calculator!</p>
