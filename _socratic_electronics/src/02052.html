<p>Plot the output waveform of a passive differentiator circuit, assuming the input is a symmetrical square wave and the circuit’s RC time constant is about one-fifth of the square wave’s pulse width:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02052x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02052x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02052x03.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Follow-up question #1: what would we have to change in this passive differentiator circuit to make the output more closely resemble ideal differentiation?</p>
<p>Follow-up question #2: explain how it is possible that the differentiator’s output waveform has a greater peak amplitude than the input (square) waveform.</p>
<p>Ask students to contrast the behavior of this passive differentiator circuit against that of a perfect differentiator (with <span class="math"><em>τ</em></span> = 0). What should the derivative plot of a square wave look like?</p>
