<p>The ohmmeter’s indication is the &quot;final word&quot; on resistance.</p>
<p>The purpose of this exercise is to make absolutely sure students can accurately measure resistance with a multimeter, and also that they can interpret resistor color codes. Select resistors that span a wide range, from less than 10 ohms to millions of ohms.</p>
<p>I recommend the following resistor color codes for students to try (all 5% tolerance):</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Blk, Brn, Grn, Gld</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Brn, Red, Brn, Gld</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Blu, Gry, Blk, Gld</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Red, Red, Org, Gld</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Brn, Grn, Yel, Gld</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Org, Org, Red, Gld</p>
<p>A good extension of this assessment is to have students demonstrate competency using both digital and analog multimeters!</p>
