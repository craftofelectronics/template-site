<p>Describe the design and function of a <em>PMMC</em> style meter movement.</p>
<p>&quot;PMMC&quot; is an acronym standing for &quot;Permanent Magnet, Moving Coil&quot;. In essence, a PMMC meter movement is built like a small DC electric motor, with limited range of motion.</p>
<p>Many textbooks provide good illustrations of PMMC meter movements. Your students may find some electronic images of PMMC meter movements on the internet. If possible, have a video projector in the classroom for projecting images like this that your students download.</p>
