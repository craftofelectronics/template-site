<p>Shown here is the schematic symbol for a <em>resistor</em>:</p>

<p>What is the purpose of a resistor? What function does it perform? Also, draw an illustration of what a real resistor looks like.</p>
<p>The purpose of a <em>resistor</em> is to provide a precise amount of electrical resistance in a circuit. Here is an illustration of a small (1/8 or 1/4 watt) resistor:</p>

<p>It is also good to know that the zig-zag symbol shown in the question is not the only symbol used to represent resistors. Another common resistor symbol is shown here:</p>

<p>Students may (properly) ask, &quot;Why is there such a thing as a component whose sole purpose is to <em>impede</em> the flow of electrons?&quot; While resistors may seem rather pointless at first, they end up being extremely valuable electrical/electronic components. If asked, you may cite several uses of resistors in circuits:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> To limit maximum circuit current to a safe value.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> To &quot;split&quot; a voltage into proportions.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> To &quot;scale&quot; meter movements, for precise measurement of current and voltage.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> To provide a non-shorting path to discharge static electricity.</p>
