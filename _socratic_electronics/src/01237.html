<p>Absolute rotary encoders often use a code known as <em>Gray code</em> rather than binary, to represent angular position. This code was patented by Frank Gray of Bell Labs in 1953, as a means of reducing errors in rotary encoder output. Examine each of these encoder disks, and determine which one is binary and which one is Gray code:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01237x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Assuming that the darkest areas on the illustration represent slots cut through the disk, and the grey areas represent parts of the disk that are opaque, mark the &quot;zero,&quot; &quot;one,&quot; and &quot;two&quot; sectors on each disk.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01237x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>I wonâ€™t directly tell you which disk is which, but I will provide a comparison of 5-bit binary versus Gray code, to help you in your analysis:</p>

<p>Ask your students what patterns they notice in the Gray code sequence, as compared to the binary count. What difference do they see between binary and Gray code, analyzing the bit transitions from one number to the next?</p>
