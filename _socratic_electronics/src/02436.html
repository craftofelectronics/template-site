<p>Explain how the characteristic curve of a 24 volt zener diode (as plotted by a curve tracer) differs from that of a normal rectifying diode, shown here:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02436x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02436x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The purpose of this question is to cause students to think about what a characteristic curve means, in the context of diode comparisons. The breakdown voltage of a zener diode is typically so low compared to that of a normal rectifying diode that this region may be easily shown on the curve tracer screen.</p>
