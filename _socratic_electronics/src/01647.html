<p>Use circuit simulation software to verify your predicted and measured parameter values.</p>
<p>Two very important &quot;given&quot; parameters are the relay coil resistance (<span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>c</em><em>o</em><em>i</em><em>l</em></sub></span>) and the relay dropout voltage (<span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>d</em><em>r</em><em>o</em><em>p</em><em>o</em><em>u</em><em>t</em></sub></span>). These are best determined experimentally.</p>
<p>Many students fail to grasp the purpose of this exercise until it is explained. The idea here is to predict <em>when</em> the relay will &quot;drop out&quot; after the switch is opened. This means solving for <span class="math"><em>t</em></span> in the time-constant (decay) equation given the initial capacitor voltage, time constant (<span class="math"><em>τ</em></span>), and the capacitor voltage at time <span class="math"><em>t</em></span>. Because this involves the use of logarithms, students may be perplexed until given assistance.</p>
<p>An extension of this exercise is to incorporate troubleshooting questions. Whether using this exercise as a performance assessment or simply as a concept-building lab, you might want to follow up your students’ results by asking them to predict the consequences of certain circuit faults.</p>
