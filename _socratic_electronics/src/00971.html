<p>What would happen to the output voltage waveform of this amplifier if the NPN transistor failed open between collector and emitter?</p>

<p>The positive half of the waveform would be &quot;missing&quot;:</p>

<p>Ask your students to identify which transistor &quot;sources&quot; current to the load, and which transistor &quot;sinks&quot; current from the load, and the answer should be easy to understand.</p>
