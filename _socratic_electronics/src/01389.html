<p>In analyzing circuits with inductors, we often take the luxury of assuming the constituent inductors to be perfect; i.e., purely inductive, with no &quot;stray&quot; properties such as winding resistance or inter-winding capacitance.</p>
<p>Real life is not so generous. With real inductors, we have to consider these factors. One measure often used to express the &quot;purity&quot; of an inductor is its so-called <em>Q rating</em>, or <em>quality factor</em>.</p>
<p>Write the formula for calculating the quality factor (Q) of a coil, and describe some of the operational parameters that may affect this number.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$Q_{coil} = {X_L \over R}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Your students should be able to immediately understand that <span class="math"><em>Q</em></span> is not a static property of an inductor. Let them explain what makes <span class="math"><em>Q</em></span> vary, based on their knowledge of inductive reactance.</p>
