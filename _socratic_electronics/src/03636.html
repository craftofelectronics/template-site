<p>A student builds an audio tone-control circuit, for adjusting the amount of bass and treble heard at the headphone (note that this is a single-channel, or <em>mono</em>, circuit rather than stereo):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03636x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>After successfully building and using this circuit for some time, the student finds that the bass control seems to have stopped working. Turning the &quot;bass&quot; potentiometer knob back and forth does absolutely nothing to change the tone or volume of the sound heard at the headphones. Identify the following:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> failed component in the circuit that could possibly account for the problem, and the type of fault (open or short) you suspect that component would have.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Identify the type of test measurement you would take on this circuit, and where you would take it, to begin isolating the exact point of failure.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Inductor <span class="math"><em>L</em><sub>1</sub></span> failed open</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Bass potentiometer failed either open or shorted</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> failed open</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Wire(s) between any of the above components failed open</p>
<p>One could take either voltage, current, or resistance measurements along the top side of the circuit. Resistance measurement would probably be the most informative type of measurement to take.</p>
