<p>What value of resistor would need to be connected in series with a 33 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>F capacitor in order to provide a <em>time constant</em> (<span class="math"><em>τ</em></span>) of 10 seconds? Express your answer in the form of a five-band precision resistor color code (with a tolerance of +/- 0.1%).</p>

<p>In order for students to answer this question, they must research the RC time constant equation and review the 5-band resistor color code.</p>
