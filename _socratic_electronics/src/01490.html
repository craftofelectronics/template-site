<p>What voltage will you choose to use for each of the station batteries?</p>
<p>I recommend 9 volts, because small 9-volt batteries are easily available and provide more than enough voltage to energize light-emitting diodes.</p>
<p>I strongly recommend using batteries to power the telegraph stations instead of AC-to-DC power supplies, as batteries are easier and safer for beginning students to work with. I also highly recommend students choose the same voltage for each station (if using the example circuit), although it will function with different voltage batteries at each station. Of course, whatever voltage is chosen as the system standard will impact other factors in the design, most notably the dropping resistor sizes.</p>
