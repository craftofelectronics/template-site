<p>Describe the purpose and function of this circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01101x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The 120 volt AC output provided by this circuit is definitely <em>not</em> sinusoidal, and the circuit’s frequency varies with load. Can you think of any way(s) to improve these aspects of the circuit (you need not show details of your design modifications)?</p>
<p>This is an <em>inverter</em> circuit.</p>
<p>Be prepared to explain what each of the transistors does, and how the transformer is able to function with DC power on its primary winding.</p>
<p>This particular schematic was derived from a Triad brand transformer application, part number TY-75A. Recommended transistors were Delco 2N278, Bendix 2N678, Clevite 2N1146, and Delco 2N173. Slight variations in resistor and capacitor sizes may result in better performance. The 3 <span class="math">Ω </span> resistors should have power ratings of at least 5 watts each, and the 150 <span class="math">Ω </span> resistors should be rated for at least 20 watts each.</p>
