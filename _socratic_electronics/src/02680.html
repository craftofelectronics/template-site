<p>Note the following logarithmic identities, using the &quot;common&quot; (base 10) logarithm:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">log10 = 1</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">log100 = 2</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">log1000 = 3</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">log10000 = 4</span><br /></p>
<p>In the first equation, the numbers 10 and 1 were related together by the log function. In the second equation, the numbers 100 and 2 were related together by the same log function, and so on.</p>
<p>Rewrite the four equations together in such a way that the same numbers are related to each other, but without writing &quot;log&quot;. In other words, represent the same mathematical relationships using some mathematical function other than the common logarithm function.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">10<sup>1</sup> = 10</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">10<sup>2</sup> = 100</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">10<sup>3</sup> = 1000</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">10<sup>4</sup> = 10000</span><br /></p>
<p>An illustration like this helps students comprehend what the &quot;log&quot; function actually does.</p>
