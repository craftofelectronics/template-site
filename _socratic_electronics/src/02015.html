<p>What does it mean if a power supply exhibits 2% voltage regulation?</p>
<p>This means the difference between no-load output voltage and full-load output voltage is 2% of the full-load output voltage.</p>
<p>The purpose of this question is to get students to look up the formula for calculating voltage regulation percentage. Notice how I did not simply ask them to regurgitate a formula; rather, I presented a realistic figure for them to interpret. When at all possible, try to format your questions in this sort of practical context!</p>
