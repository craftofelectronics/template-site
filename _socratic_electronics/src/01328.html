<p>Explain what the following statement means, with regard to the design of electronic circuits:</p>
<p><em>Faults are inevitable, but failure is not.</em></p>
<p>Specifically, what does this philosophy mean for your career as an electronics professional, entrusted with the installation, maintenance, and possibly design of complex systems?</p>
<p>Components can and will fail, but the system as a whole does not have to be so fragile as to fail with a single component fault.</p>
<p>Discuss with your students the ramifications of the &quot;fault, but no failure&quot; philosophy with regard to their daily jobs. How do their actions impact the reliability of systems, and what can they do to minimize the chances of system failures?</p>
