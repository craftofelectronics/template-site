<p>What is the largest number that can be counted to, in a base-ten system with six digits? How about in a base-twenty (vigesimal) system with four places? How about in a base-two (binary) system with ten bits?</p>
<p><span class="math">999999<sub>10</sub></span> = Nine hundred ninety nine thousand, nine hundred ninety nine.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01200x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math">1111111111<sub>2</sub></span> = one thousand twenty three.</p>
<p>Ask your students to explain why subscripts are desirable when writing numbers in binary, or in any other &quot;base&quot; numeration system for that matter.</p>
