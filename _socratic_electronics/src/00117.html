<p>A 22-gauge metal wire three feet in length contains approximately <span class="math">28. 96 × 10<sup>21</sup></span> &quot;free&quot; electrons within its volume. Suppose this wire is placed in an electric circuit conducting a current equal to <span class="math">6. 25 × 10<sup>18</sup></span> electrons per second. That is, if you were able to choose a spot along the length of this wire and were able to count electrons as they drifted by that spot, you would tally 6,250,000,000,000,000,000 electrons passing by each second. (This is a reasonable rate for electric current in a wire of this size.)</p>
<p>Calculate the average velocity of electrons through this wire.</p>
<p>Average electron velocity = 0.000647 feet per second, or <span class="math">6. 47 × 10<sup> − 4</sup></span> ft/s. This is very slow: only 0.00777 inches per second, or 0.197 millimeters per second!</p>
<p>Despite the rapid progression of the <em>effects</em> of electron motion throughout a circuit (i.e. approximately the speed of light), the actual electron velocity is extremely slow by comparison.</p>
<p>Base figures used in this calculation are as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Number of free electrons per cubic meter of metal (an example taken from 15th edition, 1983, volume 6, page 551) = <span class="math">10<sup>29</sup></span> electrons per <span class="math"><em>m</em><sup>3</sup></span>. The metal type was not specified.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> 22 gauge wire has a diameter of 0.025 inches.</p>
<p>Questions like this may be challenging to students without a strong math or science background. One problem-solving strategy I have found very useful is to simplify the terms of a problem until a solution becomes obvious, then use that simplified example to establish a pattern (equation) for obtaining a solution given <em>any</em> initial parameters. For instance, what would be the average electron velocity if the current were <span class="math">28. 96 × 10<sup>21</sup></span> electrons per second, the same figure as the number of free electrons residing in the wire? Obviously, the flow velocity would be one wire length per second, or 3 feet per second. Now, alter the current rate so that it is something closer to the one given in the problem (<span class="math">6. 25 × 10<sup>18</sup></span>), but yet still simple enough to calculate mentally. Say, half the first rate: <span class="math">14. 48 × 10<sup>21</sup></span> electrons per second. Obviously, with a flow rate half as much, the velocity will be half as well: 1.5 feet per second instead of 3 feet per second. A few iterations of this technique should reveal a pattern for solution:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$v = 3 {I \over Q}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Where,</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>v</em> = </span> Average electron velocity (feet per second)</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>I</em> = </span> Electric current (electrons per second)</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>Q</em> = </span> Number of electrons contained in wire</p>
<p>It is also very helpful to have knowledgeable students demonstrate their solution techniques in front of the class so that others may learn novel methods of problem-solving.</p>
