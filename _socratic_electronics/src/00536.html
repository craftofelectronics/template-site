<p>The core of an analog oscilloscope is a special type of vacuum tube known as a <em>Cathode Ray Tube</em>, or <em>CRT</em>. While similar in function to the CRT used in televisions, oscilloscope display tubes are specially built for the purpose of serving an a measuring instrument.</p>
<p>Explain how a CRT functions. What goes on inside the tube to produce waveform displays on the screen?</p>
<p>There are many tutorials and excellent reference books on CRT function â€“ go read a few of them!</p>
<p>Some of your students may come across photographs and illustrations of CRTs for use in their presentation. If at all possible, provide a way for individual students to share their visual findings with their classmates, through the use of an overhead projector, computer monitor, or computer projector. Discuss in detail the operation of a CRT with your students, especially noting the electrostatic method of electron beam deflection used to &quot;steer&quot; the beam to specific areas on the screen.</p>
