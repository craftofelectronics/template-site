<p>How many degrees of phase shift must the feedback circuit (the box in this schematic) introduce to the signal in order for this common-emitter amplifier circuit to oscillate?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01080x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>We know that oscillator circuits require &quot;regenerative&quot; feedback in order to continuously sustain oscillation. Explain how the correct amount of phase shift is <em>always</em> provided in the feedback circuit to ensure that the nature of the feedback is always regenerative, not degenerative. In other words, explain why it is not possible to incorrectly choose feedback network component values and thus fail to achieve the proper amount of phase shift.</p>
<p>The feedback network in this circuit must provide 180 degrees of phase shift, in order to sustain oscillations.</p>
<p>So long as the feedback network contains the correct <em>types</em> of components (resistors, capacitors, and/or inductors) in a working configuration, the componentsâ€™ values will not alter the amount of phase shift, only the frequency of the oscillation.</p>
<p>Ask your students to explain why the feedback network must provide 180 degrees of phase shift to the signal. Ask them to explain how this requirement relates to the need for <em>regenerative</em> feedback in an oscillator circuit.</p>
<p>The question and answer concerning feedback component selection is a large conceptual leap for some students. It may baffle some that the phase shift of a reactive circuit will always be the proper amount to ensure regenerative feedback, for any arbitrary combination of component values, because they should know the phase shift of a reactive circuit depends on the values of its constituent components. However, once they realize that the phase shift of a reactive circuit is <em>also</em> dependent on the signal frequency, the resolution to this paradox is much easier to understand.</p>
