<p>The ripple frequency of a half-wave rectifier circuit powered by 60 Hz AC is measured to be 60 Hz. The ripple frequency of a full-wave rectifier circuit powered by the exact same 60 Hz AC line voltage is measured to be 120 Hz. Explain why the ripple frequency of the full-wave rectifier is twice that of the half-wave rectifier.</p>
<p>There are double the number of pulses in the full-wave rectifier’s output, meaning the wave-shape repeats itself twice as often.</p>
<p>I have heard students concoct very interesting (and wrong) explanations for why the two frequencies differ. One common misconception is that is has something to do with the transformer, as though a transformer had the ability to step <em>frequency</em> up and down just as easily as voltage or current! If students are not understanding why there is a frequency difference, you might want to help them out by asking two students to come up to the front of the class and draw two waveforms: half-wave and full-wave, along with their original AC (unrectified) waveforms.</p>
