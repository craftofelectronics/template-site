<p>An audio power amplifier with an internal impedance of 8 <span class="math">Ω </span> needs to power a set of speakers with a combined total impedance of 1 <span class="math">Ω </span>. We know that connecting this speaker array directly to the amplifier’s output will not result in optimum power transfer, because of the impedance mismatch.</p>
<p>Someone suggests using a transformer to match the two disparate impedances, but what turns ratio does this transformer need to have? Should it be used in a step-up configuration, or a step-down configuration? Explain your answers.</p>
<p>2.83:1 winding ratio, step-down.</p>
<p>Students should know at this point how to calculate the impedance transformation ratio from a transformer’s winding ratio. In this question, they are challenged to calculate &quot;backwards&quot; to find the winding ratio from the impedance ratio.</p>
