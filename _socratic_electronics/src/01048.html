<p>While the &quot;Branch Current&quot; method may be used to analyze an unbalanced bridge circuit, it requires a lot of calculation! In this circuit, determine how many variables are needed to solve for all currents:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01048x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Six variables are required to account for all unique values of current in this circuit (<span class="math"><em>I</em><sub>1</sub></span> through <span class="math"><em>I</em><sub>6</sub></span>).</p>
<p>Challenge question: draw arrows in this circuit depicting these six currents, and write one KCL equation for each node.</p>
<p>Ask your students to explain why it is difficult to solve for the currents in a circuit like this using the &quot;Branch Current&quot; method. How many equations would be necessary to solve for the values of six variables?</p>
