<p>Calculate the voltage gain of this circuit, if R1 has a resistance of 8.1 k<span class="math">Ω </span> and R2 has a resistance of 1.75 k<span class="math">Ω </span>:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00673x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math"><em>A</em><sub><em>V</em></sub> = </span> 0.178</p>
<p>Follow-up question: how does this gain figure (<span class="math"><em>A</em><sub><em>V</em></sub></span>) relate to the &quot;voltage divider formula&quot;?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$E_R = E_{total} \Bigl({R \over R_{total}}\Bigr)$</span><br /></p>
<p>Students should readily recognize this circuit as a voltage divider, from their education in basic DC circuits. Though it may seem strange to calculate the &quot;gain&quot; of a completely passive and indeed <em>dissipative</em> circuit, it is entirely valid.</p>
<p>Discuss with your students the maximum and minimum possible power gain values for a circuit of this type.</p>
