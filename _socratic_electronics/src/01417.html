<p>What is the purpose of a <em>seven-segment decoder</em> circuit? What is a &quot;seven-segment&quot; display, and why do we need a decoder circuit to drive it? Research the part number for a typical seven-segment decoder circuit (either CMOS or TTL).</p>
<p>Seven-segment displays are a very common numerical interface for digital electronic equipment:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01417x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>A special decoder circuit is needed to translate 4-bit BCD codes into the particular combinations of segment activations that represent decimal digits.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: what does the internal schematic of a typical seven-segment display look like? Is there just one type, or are there different types of seven-segment displays?</p>
<p>Be sure to ask your students to reveal the decoder datasheets they found. Once again, manufacturer datasheets contain a wealth of information, and your students will learn much by researching them.</p>
