<p>If an <em>isolation transformer</em> (a transformer with the same number of &quot;turns&quot; in the primary and secondary coils) is connected between an AC source and an AC load, we will measure the same voltage and the same current at both source and load terminals:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01877x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>If we calculate power output by the source and power dissipated by the load, the value is the same: 420 Watts (<span class="math"><em>P</em> = <em>I</em><em>V</em></span>).</p>
<p>Now suppose we analyze a circuit containing a <em>step-up</em> transformer (one with more turns of wire in the secondary coil than in the primary coil). With a step-up transformer, the load voltage will be greater than the supply voltage. In this example, I show a step-up transformer with a 1:2 step ratio:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01877x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Assuming the load resistance is completely different from the first (isolation transformer) circuit, what can you deduce about the load current and the power (both source and load) in this circuit? Is the load current less than the source current? Is the load current greater than the source current? Is the load power greater than the source power? Explain your answers.</p>
<p>The basic physical law known as <em>The Law of Conservation of Energy</em> tells you all you need to know about source power and load power! And from that, you should not only be able to qualitatively determine the load current in this circuit, but also calculate it with a fair degree of precision.</p>
<p>The only reason I hesitate to tell students they can calculate load current <em>precisely</em> is because it was not stated whether or not the transformer is &quot;lossy&quot; at all. No real transformer is 100% lossless, of course, and this is something that we must take into consideration in &quot;real life.&quot;</p>
<p>I have found that the Conservation of Energy approach not only makes sense to students as they learn to calculate transformer behavior, but it is an excellent reinforcement of a basic physical law, a good understanding of which will serve them well throughout their careers.</p>
