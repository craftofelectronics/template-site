<p>Explain why &quot;switching&quot; power supply circuits are much more common in consumer-grade electronic devices (personal computers, digital cameras and camcorders, etc.) than &quot;brute force&quot; power supply circuits. Why donâ€™t manufacturers use simpler &quot;brute force&quot; power supplies consisting of nothing more than a transformer, rectifier, and filter?</p>
<p>Switching power supplies are smaller, lighter weight, and more efficient than their equivalent &quot;brute force&quot; counterparts.</p>
