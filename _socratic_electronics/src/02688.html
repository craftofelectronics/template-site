<p>What began as a fractional exponent problem ended up as a simple fraction, through the application of logarithms. What does this tell you about the utility of logarithms as an arithmetic tool?</p>
<p>That logarithms can reduce the complexity of an equation from fractional exponentiation, down to simple fractions, indicates its usefulness as a tool to <em>simplify</em> arithmetic problems. Specifically, the logarithm of a root of a number is equal to the logarithm of that number divided by the root index.</p>
<p>In mathematics, any procedure that reduces a complex type of problem into a simpler type of problem is called a <em>transform function</em>, and logarithms are one of the simplest types of transform functions in existence.</p>
