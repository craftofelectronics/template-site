<p>Many modern CMOS gate circuits are <em>buffered</em> with additional transistor stages on their outputs. For example, an unbuffered AND gate is shown here, with no more transistors than is necessary to fulfill the &quot;AND&quot; logic function:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01280x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>One type of &quot;buffered&quot; CMOS AND gate looks like this:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01280x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>As far as the basic logic function is concerned, the additional transistors are unnecessary. However, the &quot;buffering&quot; they provide does serve a useful function. What is that function? Are there any disadvantages to buffered logic gates, versus unbuffered?</p>
<p>Buffered gates exhibit better noise immunity than unbuffered gates. One disadvantage to buffering, though, is increased propagation delay time.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: identify the on/off states of all transistors in the buffered circuit for both (high and low) input conditions.</p>
<p>Texas Instruments publishes an excellent application report (SCHA004 â€“ October 2002) comparing buffered versus unbuffered CMOS logic gates. I highly recommend it for your reference.</p>
