<p>If we were to connect an ammeter directly to an ohmmeter, what would you expect to see the ohmmeter register, for resistance between its test leads?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00272x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The ohmmeter should register a very low resistance.</p>
<p>Ask your students <em>why</em> an ammeter should have a very low resistance (fractions of an ohm) between its test leads. How does this property of all ammeters relate to how they are used to measured current in real circuits?</p>
