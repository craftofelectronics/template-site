<p>What happens to the inductance of an inductor as its core becomes <em>saturated</em>? Does the inductance value increase, decrease, or remain the same? Explain your answer.</p>
<p>As the core of an inductor becomes saturated with magnetic flux, there will be less change in flux for a given change in current (the derivative <span class="math">$d\phi \over di$</span> will be less):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00473x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>This causes the inductance to <em>decrease</em>.</p>
<p>Ask your students to identify what condition(s) might lead to a condition of saturation. And, even if the extreme ends of the <span class="math"><em>B</em> − <em>H</em></span> curve are avoided, what does the nonlinear shape of the <span class="math"><em>B</em> − <em>H</em></span> plot indicate about the linearity of an inductor? The inductance formula (<span class="math">$e = L{di \over dt}$</span>) assumes perfect linearity, but is this really true for an inductor whose core exhibits this kind of magnetic flux/force relationship?</p>
