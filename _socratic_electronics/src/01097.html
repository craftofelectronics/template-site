<p>What is a <em>DC-DC converter</em> circuit, and what applications might such a circuit be used for?</p>
<p>A &quot;DC-DC converter&quot; is a circuit that transforms a DC voltage either up or down, generally with an inverse transformation in current. Applications include supplying DC power to load devices where the main power source is DC, but of the wrong voltage.</p>
<p>In many cases, DC-DC converters find use in large systems that were not designed well (i.e. with proper DC voltages provided by a common AC-DC supply circuit). However, converter circuits do have more legitimate uses, including applications where <em>isolation</em> is required between two DC circuits. Ask your students what &quot;electrical isolation&quot; is any why it might be important.</p>
