<p>By themselves, series circuits should be fairly easy for you to analyze at this point. The same may be said for parallel circuits by themselves. The respective rules for each (voltages same across parallel components; currents same through series components; parallel currents add; series voltages add; etc.) are not that difficult to remember, especially if you understand <em>why</em> each one is true. Things become much trickier, though, when we begin to mix series networks of resistors with parallel networks of resistors, as we jump from one rule set to the other in our analysis. My best advice here is to avoid trying to memorize the rules by rote, and rather work on comprehending why each rule is as it is for each type of circuit. And of course, practice, practice, practice!</p>
<p>When applying Ohm’s Law (<span class="math"><em>E</em> = <em>I</em><em>R</em></span> ; <span class="math">$I = {E \over R}$</span> ; <span class="math">$R = {E \over I}$</span>) to circuits containing multiple resistances, students often mix contexts of voltage, current, and resistance. Whenever you use any equation describing a physical phenomenon, be sure that each variable of that equation relates to the proper real-life value in the problem you’re working on solving. For example, when calculating the current through resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span>, you must be sure that the values for voltage and resistance are appropriate for that resistor and not some other resistor in the circuit. If you are calculating <span class="math"><em>I</em><sub><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></sub></span> using the Ohm’s Law equation <span class="math">$I = {E \over R}$</span>, then you must use the value of <em>that resistor’s</em> voltage (<span class="math"><em>E</em><sub><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></sub></span>) and <em>that resistor’s</em> resistance (<span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span>), not some other voltage and/or resistance value(s). Some students have an unfortunate tendency to overlook context when seeking values to substitute in place of variables in Ohm’s Law problems, and this leads to incorrect results.</p>
<p>When analyzing a series-parallel circuit to determine component voltages and currents, one must be very careful to reduce the circuit step-by-step, section-by-section, into equivalent resistances. Students new to this process typically see all the work that is involved and try to save effort by taking shortcuts, which paradoxically causes <em>more</em> work and <em>more</em> confusion for them later on. Use lots of paper to document your work when you reduce series-parallel resistor networks to equivalent resistances, re-drawing the circuit for each reduction. This helps reduce the number of mistakes, and also makes it easier to transfer calculated values of voltage and current to the correct components (see the difficult concept shown above: using Ohm’s Law in context).</p>
<p>Most students find that qualitative analysis of electric circuits is much more difficult than quantitative analysis. In other words, it is easier to use a calculator to compute how much current goes through a particular resistor in a circuit than it is to figure out if that current will increase, decrease, or remain the same given a certain change in the circuit. What this requires is a &quot;feel&quot; for how variables in Ohm’s Law and Kirchhoff’s Laws relate to each other, which is a very different skill than numerical calculation. A good way to build this skill is to practice qualitative analysis on every quantitative circuit question you encounter. Even though the question only asks for a numerical answer, you can challenge yourself by asking whether or not a particular variable will change (and which direction that change will be in) given any particular change in the circuit (more or less supply voltage, a wire breaking open, a resistor failing open, or a resistor failing shorted). Then, you may re-calculate the numerical answers to see if your qualitative predictions are correct. Computer-based circuit simulation programs are excellent for this, as they allow one to skip the steps of numerical calculation to rapidly see the effects of certain circuit faults.</p>
