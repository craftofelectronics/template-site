<p>For a given amount of water pressure, which will flow a greater rate of water: a small (restrictive) nozzle or a large (unrestrictive) nozzle? Explain how this relates to the study of voltage, current, and resistance in a simple electric circuit.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00083x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Obviously, an unrestrictive nozzle will pass a greater flow rate of water through it, all other factors being equal. In an electric circuit, less resistance will pass a greater flow rate of electrons (current) for a given amount of &quot;pressure&quot; (voltage).</p>
<p>Water flow is not a perfect analogy for electricity, but is close enough to be useful in basic electricity education. Be prepared to discuss the inadequacies of water as an analogy with your students (i.e. &quot;How come electrons donâ€™t spill out the end of an open wire like water spills out the end of an open hose or pipe?&quot;).</p>
