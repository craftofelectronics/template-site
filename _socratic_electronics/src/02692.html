<p>Find a datasheet for the AD538, an integrated circuit manufactured by Analog Devices. Then, read it carefully and explain how it is able to perform arithmetic functions such as multiplication, division, powers, and roots.</p>
<p>Iâ€™ll leave this up to you to research and to your classmates and instructor to discuss!</p>
<p>This question is destined for obsolescence, as one day the AD538 will no longer be manufactured. Until then, it is a fine piece of engineering, showcasing the power of logarithms as a computational aid in analog circuitry.</p>
