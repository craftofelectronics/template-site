<p>One major different between a common-emitter amplifier configuration and a common-collector amplifier configuration is a principle called <em>negative feedback</em>, where changes in output voltage &quot;feed back&quot; to influence the amplifier’s input signal, which in turn influences the output voltage again. Common-collector amplifier circuits have large amounts of negative feedback inherent to their design.</p>
<p>The absence or presence of negative feedback in an amplifier circuit has profound effects on voltage gain (<span class="math"><em>A</em><sub><em>V</em></sub></span>). Compare the relative voltage gains of the following amplifiers:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00963x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>At first, the low voltage gain of the common-collector amplifier may appear to be a disadvantage of that circuit design. However, there is one major benefit relevant to the common-collector amplifier’s voltage gain, being a direct result of negative feedback. What is this advantage?</p>
<p>Although the common-collector amplifier has a very low voltage gain (<span class="math"><em>A</em><sub><em>V</em></sub> = 1</span>), that gain is absolutely <em>stable</em> over a wide range of operating conditions and component selection.</p>
<p>Discuss with your students the many factors that can influence voltage gain in a common-emitter amplifier circuit, and then compare that relative instability with the rock-solid stability of the common-collector amplifier’s voltage gain. What benefit is it to a circuit designer to have a stable voltage gain from a particular amplifier design?</p>
