<p>We know that the output of a differentiator circuit is proportional to the time-derivative of the input voltage:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02705x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$V_{out} \propto {dV_{in} \over dt}$</span><br /></p>
<p>But how do we turn this proportionality into an exact equality, so that it accounts for the values of <span class="math"><em>R</em></span> and <span class="math"><em>C</em></span>? Although the answer to this question is easy enough to simply look up in an electronics reference book, it would be great to actually derive the exact equation from your knowledge of electronic component behaviors! Here are a couple of hints:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$I = {V \over R} \hbox{\hskip 50pt} i = C {dv \over dt}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$V_{out} = - RC \left( {dV_{in} \over dt} \right)$</span><br /></p>
<p>Follow-up question: why is there a negative sign in the equation?</p>
<p>The two &quot;hint&quot; equations given at the end of the question beg for algebraic substitution, but students must be careful which variable(s) to substitute! Both equations contain an <span class="math"><em>I</em></span>, and both equations also contain a <span class="math"><em>V</em></span>. The answer to that question can only be found by looking at the schematic diagram: do the resistor and capacitor share the same current, the same voltage, or both?</p>
