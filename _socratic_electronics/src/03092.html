<p>Plot the solutions to the equation <span class="math"><em>y</em> + <em>x</em> = 8</span> on a graph:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03092x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>On the same graph, plot the solutions to the equation <span class="math"><em>y</em> − <em>x</em> = 3</span>. What is the significance of the point where the two lines cross?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03092x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The point of intersection between the two lines represents the one solution set that satisfies <em>both</em> equations (where <span class="math"><em>x</em> = 2. 5</span> and <span class="math"><em>y</em> = 5. 5</span>).</p>
<p>The purpose of this question is to gently introduce students to the concept of simultaneous systems of equations, where a set of solutions satisfies more than one equation at a time. It is important for students to understand the basic concepts of graphing before they try to answer this question, though.</p>
