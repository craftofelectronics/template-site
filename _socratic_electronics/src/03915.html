<p>The following schematic diagram shows an eight-step arbitrary waveform generator. The analog multiplexer selects one of the eight potentiometer signals at a time, stepping from one to the next at the pace of the clock pulse:</p>

<p>Explain what effect a <em>shorted</em> bilateral switch would have on the output waveform. Be as specific as possible.</p>
<p>If one of the bilateral switches were to fail shorted, it would skew all the arbitrary waveform voltages &quot;toward&quot; the one with the failed switch, distorting the waveform from its original shape.</p>
<p>A failed-shorted bilateral switch would create a sort of <em>passive averager</em> circuit between the shorted-switch pot and the selected-switch pot. If your students have difficulty figuring out the effects of this fault, remind them of what a passive averager is, and how it works.</p>
