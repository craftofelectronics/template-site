<p>Complete this statement by substituting the correct electrical variables (voltage, current, resistance, capacitance):</p>
<p>Capacitors oppose changes in (<em>fill-in-the-blank</em>), reacting to such changes by producing a (<em>fill-in-the-blank</em>).</p>
<p>Capacitors oppose changes in <strong>voltage</strong>, reacting to such changes by producing a <strong>current</strong>.</p>
<p>Emphasize to your students that capacitance is an essentially <em>reactive</em> property, opposing change in voltage over time. It is not steady voltage that capacitors react to, only changing voltage.</p>
