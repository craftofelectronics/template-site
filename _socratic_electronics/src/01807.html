<p>The model &quot;555&quot; integrated circuit is a very popular and useful &quot;chip&quot; used for timing purposes in electronic circuits. The basis for this circuit’s timing function is a resistor-capacitor (RC) network:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01807x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>In this configuration, the &quot;555&quot; chip acts as an <em>oscillator</em>: switching back and forth between &quot;high&quot; (full voltage) and &quot;low&quot; (no voltage) output states. The time duration of one of these states is set by the charging action of the capacitor, through both resistors (<span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span> in series). The other state’s time duration is set by the capacitor discharging through one resistor (<span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span>):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01807x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Obviously, the charging time constant must be <span class="math"><em>τ</em><sub><em>c</em><em>h</em><em>a</em><em>r</em><em>g</em><em>e</em></sub> = (<em>R</em><sub>1</sub> + <em>R</em><sub>2</sub>)<em>C</em></span>, while the discharging time constant is <span class="math"><em>τ</em><sub><em>d</em><em>i</em><em>s</em><em>c</em><em>h</em><em>a</em><em>r</em><em>g</em><em>e</em></sub> = <em>R</em><sub>2</sub><em>C</em></span>. In each of the states, the capacitor is either charging or discharging 50% of the way between its starting and final values (by virtue of how the 555 chip operates), so we know the expression <span class="math">$e^{-t \over \tau} = 0.5$</span>, or 50 percent.<sup><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>For those who must know why, the 555 timer in this configuration is designed to keep the capacitor voltage cycling between <span class="math">${1 \over 3}$</span> of the supply voltage and <span class="math">${2 \over 3}$</span> of the supply voltage. So, when the capacitor is charging from <span class="math">${1 \over 3}V_{CC}$</span> to its (final) value of full supply voltage (<span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>C</em><em>C</em></sub></span>), having this charge cycle interrupted at <span class="math">${2 \over 3}V_{CC}$</span> by the 555 chip constitutes charging to the half-way point, since <span class="math">${2 \over 3}$</span> of half-way between <span class="math">${1 \over 3}$</span> and 1. When discharging, the capacitor starts at <span class="math">${2 \over 3}V_{CC}$</span> and is interrupted at <span class="math">${1 \over 3}V_{CC}$</span>, which again constitutes 50% of the way from where it started to where it was (ultimately) headed.</p>
<p>Develop two equations for predicting the &quot;charge&quot; time and &quot;discharge&quot; time of this 555 timer circuit, so that anyone designing such a circuit for specific time delays will know what resistor and capacitor values to use.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math"><em>t</em><sub><em>c</em><em>h</em><em>a</em><em>r</em><em>g</em><em>e</em></sub> =  − ln0. 5(<em>R</em><sub>1</sub> + <em>R</em><sub>2</sub>)<em>C</em></span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math"><em>t</em><sub><em>d</em><em>i</em><em>s</em><em>c</em><em>h</em><em>a</em><em>r</em><em>g</em><em>e</em></sub> =  − ln0. 5<em>R</em><sub>2</sub><em>C</em></span><br /></p>
<p>Although it may seem premature to introduce the 555 timer chip when students are just finishing their study of DC, I wanted to provide a practical application of RC circuits, and also of algebra in generating useful equations. If you deem this question too advanced for your student group, by all means skip it.</p>
<p>Incidentally, I simplified the diagram where I show the capacitor discharging: there is actually another current at work here. Since it wasn’t relevant to the problem, I omitted it. However, some students may be adept enough to catch the omission, so I show it here:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01807x03.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Note that this second current (through the battery) does not go anywhere near the capacitor, and so is irrelevant to the discharge cycle time.</p>
