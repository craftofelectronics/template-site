<p>Use circuit simulation software to verify your predicted and actual truth tables.</p>
<p>The purpose of this exercise is for students to connect a multiplexer to fulfill an arbitrary logic function specified by the instructor, thus showing the flexibility of the technique.</p>
<p>Here, the arrangement of the input letters C, B, and A is purposeful: C represents the most significant bit, while A represents the least significant bit, just like the IC datasheets typically order the input lines.</p>
