<p>Determine the amount of current from point <strong>A</strong> to point <strong>B</strong> in this circuit, and also the output voltage of the operational amplifier:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02517x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math"><em>I</em></span> = 6.5 mA <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>o</em><em>u</em><em>t</em></sub></span> = -6.5 V</p>
<p>This question is best preceded by #02516, which asks for students to solve for the current between <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong> with no opamp in the circuit (simply grounded at point <strong>B</strong>). When students realize that point <strong>B</strong> is now a <em>virtual</em> ground instead of a real ground, they see that the same conclusion derived by Kirchhoffâ€™s Current Law in the passive circuit is still valid in this active circuit, and that the result is an output <em>voltage</em> corresponding to that current.</p>
