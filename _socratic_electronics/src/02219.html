<p>Describe the purpose of a <em>current transformer</em> in an AC power circuit.</p>
<p>Current transformers, or <em>CTs</em>, are used to measure high currents in potentially high voltage AC circuits, providing precise current reduction and galvanic isolation between the measuring circuit and the power circuit.</p>
<p>Ask your students to describe the physical appearance and construction of a CT. If possible, bring one in to your classroom for viewing and discussion.</p>
