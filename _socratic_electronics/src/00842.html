<p>One method of achieving reduced-voltage starting for large electric motors is to insert series resistances into each of the motorâ€™s power conductors. When starting, all power must go through the resistors. After the motor has had time to speed up, another set of &quot;starter&quot; contacts bypass line power around the resistors, directly to the motor windings.</p>
<p>Draw a diagram showing how this could be done for a single-phase electric motor, using two starter contacts: &quot;R&quot; for &quot;run&quot; and &quot;S&quot; for &quot;start&quot;. Hint: you only need two contacts and one resistor!</p>
<p>None of the control circuitry (start switch, overload contact, starter coil, etc.) is shown in this diagram:</p>

<p>If students have studied the autotransformer method of reduced-voltage starting, ask them to compare this method against that. Certainly, the resistive method is simpler, but does the autotransformer method have its own advantage(s)?</p>
