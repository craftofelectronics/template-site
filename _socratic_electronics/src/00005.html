<p>If you scuff your feet across a carpeted surface on a dry day, you will produce an electric potential resulting from a static electric charge that may range in the order of tens of thousands of volts! Can this pose a danger to you, at least in principle?</p>
<p>Static electric charges rarely pose any shock hazard, because the actual charge quantity (measured in <em>coulombs</em>) is so small that the resulting current upon discharge can only last a very brief moment in time.</p>
<p>This question is a good starting point for a discussion on <em>time</em> as a variable in determining electric shock hazard. There is more to determining hazard to the human body than a simple assessment of volts, amps, and ohms!</p>
