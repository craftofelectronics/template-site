<p>Suppose we were to build a series &quot;LC&quot; circuit and connect it to a function generator, where we could vary the frequency of the AC voltage powering it:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00604x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Calculate the amount of current in the circuit, given the following figures:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Power supply voltage = 3 volts RMS</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Power supply frequency = 100 Hz</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Capacitor = 4.7 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>F</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Inductor = 100 mH</p>
<p>Then, describe what happens to the circuit current as the frequency is gradually increased.</p>
<p>Circuit current = 10.88 mA RMS. As the frequency is gradually increased, the circuit current increases as well.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: what do you suppose might happen to the circuit current if the frequency is increased to the point that the reactances of the inductor and capacitor completely cancel each other? What safety concerns might arise from this possibility?</p>
<p>In order for your students to arrive at the answer of circuit current increasing with frequency, they must perform a few calculations at different frequencies. Do this together, as a group, and note how the circuit’s impedance changes with frequency.</p>
