<p>Explain how you could calculate the capacitance value of a capacitor (in units of Farads), by measuring AC voltage, AC current, and frequency in a circuit of this configuration:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02113x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Write a single formula solving for capacitance given these three values (<span class="math"><em>V</em></span>, <span class="math"><em>I</em></span>, and <span class="math"><em>f</em></span>).</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$C = {I \over {2 \pi f V}}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Ask your students to show how they arrived at the formula for calculating <span class="math"><em>C</em></span>. The algebra is not difficult, but some substitution is required.</p>
