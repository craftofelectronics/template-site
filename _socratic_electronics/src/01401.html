<p>Supposed we used J-K flip-flops with asynchronous inputs (Preset and Clear) to build a counter:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01401x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>With the asynchronous lines paralleled as such, what are we able to make the counter do now that we weren’t before we had asynchronous inputs available to us?</p>
<p>Now, we are able to force the counter to zero (0000) or full count (1111) at will.</p>
<p>Ask your students why this feature might be useful. Can they think of any applications involving a counter circuit where it would be practical to force its output to either zero or full count regardless of the clock’s action?</p>
