<p>Given a battery and a light bulb, show how you would connect these two devices together with wire so as to energize the light bulb:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00001x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>This is the simplest option, but not the only one.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00001x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>This question gives students a good opportunity to discuss the basic concept of a circuit. It is very easy to build, safe, and should be assembled by each student individually in class. Also, emphasize how simple circuits like this may be assembled at home as part of the &quot;research&quot; portion of the worksheet. To research answers for worksheet questions does not necessarily mean the information has to come from a book! Encourage experimentation when the conditions are known to be safe.</p>
<p>Have students brainstorm all the important concepts learned in making this simple circuit. What general principles may be derived from this particular exercise?</p>
