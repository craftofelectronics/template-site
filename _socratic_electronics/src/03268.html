<p>Follow-up question: how much voltage is present at the node (junction point) where <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span>, <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span>, and <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>3</sub></span> all connect together, measured with reference to ground?</p>

<p>A noteworthy feature of this circuit’s schematic is how the power supply connections are shown. Unlike many of my schematic diagrams, I do not show a &quot;battery&quot; symbol here for a voltage source. Instead, I show power supply &quot;rail&quot; symbols (flat line and a ground symbol). Let your students know that this is very common symbolism in modern schematics, and that is merely saves having to draw lines to a voltage source symbol (as well as the source symbol itself).</p>
<p>Discuss with your students what a good procedure might be for calculating the unknown values in this problem, and also how they might check their work.</p>
<p>Students often have difficulty formulating a method of solution: determining what steps to take to get from the given conditions to a final answer. While it is helpful at first for you (the instructor) to show them, it is bad for you to show them too often, lest they stop thinking for themselves and merely follow your lead. A teaching technique I have found very helpful is to have students come up to the board (alone or in teams) in front of class to write their problem-solving strategies for all the others to see. They don’t have to actually do the math, but rather outline the steps they would take, in the order they would take them.</p>
<p>By having students , everyone gets an opportunity to see multiple methods of solution, and you (the instructor) get to see how (and if!) your students are thinking. An especially good point to emphasize in these &quot;open thinking&quot; activities is how to check your work to see if any mistakes were made.</p>
