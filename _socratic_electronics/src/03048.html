<p>Why would anyone use programmable logic devices (PLD, PAL, PLA, CPLD, FPGA, etc.) in place of traditional &quot;hard-wired&quot; logic such as NAND, NOR, AND, and OR gates? Are there any applications where hard-wired logic would do a better job than a programmable device?</p>
<p>Iâ€™ll let you do the research on this one!</p>
<p>Ask your students to share where they found their information on programmable devices, and how they determined the advantages and disadvantages of this technology compared to hard-wired logic.</p>
