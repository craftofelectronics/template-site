<p>Explain how this motor overcurrent protection circuit works:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{04022x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>I’ll let you and your classmates figure out this circuit! It is fairly straightforward to analyze.</p>
<p>If you want to add more challenge to this question, ask your students to come up with practical component values. Of course, you will need to provide some base values such as:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Maximum motor current (locked-rotor)</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Motor supply voltage</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Relay coil current</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Transistor <span class="math"><em>β</em></span></p>
