<p>Examine the following audio tone control circuit, used to control the balance of bass and treble heard at the headphones from an audio source such as a radio or CD player:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03507x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Suppose that after working just fine for quite a long while, suddenly no more bass tones were heard through the headphones. Identify at least two component or wiring faults that could cause this to happen.</p>
<p>Here are some possibilities:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> failed open</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>p</em><em>o</em><em>t</em>1</sub></span> failed open</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math"><em>L</em><sub>1</sub></span> failed open</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Open wire connections between any of the above listed components</p>
<p>The circuit shown in the question is not very practical for direct headphone use, unless low-value resistors are used. Otherwise, the losses are too great and maximum volume suffers. An improvement over the original circuit is one where a matching transformer is used to effectively increase the impedance of the headphones:</p>
