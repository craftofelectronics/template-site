<p>One practical application of S-R latch circuits is <em>switch debouncing</em>. Explain what &quot;bounce&quot; refers to in mechanical switches, and also explain how this circuit eliminates it:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01353x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Also, show where an oscilloscope could be connected to display any switch &quot;bounce,&quot; and explain how the oscilloscope would have to be configured to capture this transient event.</p>
<p>The &quot;latching&quot; ability of the S-R latch circuit holds the output state steady during the mechanical switch’s bouncing action, allowing a &quot;clean&quot; output transition to take place.</p>
<p>Connecting the input probe of an oscilloscope to either the S or R input of the latch will show bounce, if it occurs. To capture this event, the ’scope would have to be configured for single-sweep mode, and have the triggering controls properly set. A digital storage oscilloscope is essential for this type of work!</p>
<p>Follow-up question: how do you suggest choosing appropriate pull-down resistor sizes for this circuit, or any CMOS circuit for that matter?</p>
<p>Many textbooks use switch debouncing as a practical example of S-R latch function, so I won’t bother giving hints as to how this circuit works. Let the students do their own research, and let them explain it to you during discussion.</p>
<p>If students need practical examples of how switch &quot;bouncing&quot; can be bad, suggest digital counter circuits, where a mechanical switch causes a counter to increment (or decrement) once per actuation. If the switch bounces, the counter will increment (or decrement) more than once per switch actuation, which is undesirable.</p>
<p>Oscilloscope triggering is one of those features that separates novice ’scope users from competent ’scope users. Anyone can learn to display a repetitive waveform on an oscilloscope with a minimum of adjustment. Many modern digital oscilloscopes even have &quot;auto-configure&quot; features to lock in such waveforms for display. However, to set up triggering on one-time events requires that the user understand not only the oscilloscope’s functions, but also the nature of the event to be captured.</p>
<p>Note to your students how the <span class="math">$\overline{Q}$</span> output of the latch doesn’t go anywhere. Often, we have applications where the second output of a latch is unused. Ask your students whether or not this constitutes a problem. (If you get blank stares from asking this question, remind students that unused CMOS inputs have to be grounded or tied to <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>D</em><em>D</em></sub></span>, or else damage may occur. Ask them whether or not the same rule applies to gate outputs.) This will be a good review of internal gate circuit construction.</p>
