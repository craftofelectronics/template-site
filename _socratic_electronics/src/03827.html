<p>Predict how the operation of this motor control circuit will be affected as a result of the following faults. Consider each fault independently (i.e. one at a time, no multiple faults):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03827x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> &quot;Stop&quot; pushbutton switch fails open:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Relay contact CR1-1 fails open:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Relay contact CR1-2 fails open:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Relay coil CR1 fails open:</p>
<p>For each of these conditions, explain <em>why</em> the resulting effects will occur.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> &quot;Stop&quot; pushbutton switch fails open: <em>Motor cannot start, lamp never energizes.</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Relay contact CR1-1 fails open: <em>Motor starts and lamp energizes when &quot;Start&quot; button is pressed, but both immediately de-energize when it is released.</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Relay contact CR1-2 fails open: <em>&quot;Motor run&quot; lamp turns on and off as expected, but the motor itself never runs.</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Relay coil CR1 fails open: <em>Motor cannot start, lamp never energizes.</em></p>
<p>The purpose of this question is to approach the domain of circuit troubleshooting from a perspective of knowing what the fault is, rather than only knowing what the symptoms are. Although this is not necessarily a realistic perspective, it helps students build the foundational knowledge necessary to diagnose a faulted circuit from empirical data. Questions such as this should be followed (eventually) by other questions asking students to identify likely faults based on measurements.</p>
