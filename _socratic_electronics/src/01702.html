<p>Briefly answer the following safety questions:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> What does electric current do to muscle tissue?</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> What can electric current do to motor muscles (fingers, arms, legs)?</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> What can electric current do to heart and lungs?</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Why should you use one hand while working on live power circuits? Which hand?</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Why is water dangerous when working around electric power?</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Why is metal jewelry dangerous to wear when working on electric circuits?</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> What kinds of tools are best for working on live power circuits?</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> What kind of immediate medical attention does an electric shock victim require?</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> What footwear is appropriate when working around electric power?</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> What footwear is <strong>not</strong> appropriate when working around electric power?</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> What does electric current do to muscle tissue? <em>Electric current causes muscles to contract.</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> What can electric current do to motor muscles (fingers, arms, legs)? <em>It may cause them to involuntarily contract.</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> What can electric current do to heart and lungs? <em>Paralyze them.</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Why should you use one hand while working on live power circuits? <em>To minimize the danger of an across-the-chest path for electric current.</em> Which hand? <em>The right, because the heart is more vulnerable to shock current going through the left-hand side of the chest.</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Why is water dangerous when working around electric power? <em>It lowers the resistance of porous substances, including human skin.</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Why is metal jewelry dangerous to wear when working on electric circuits? <em>Because the metal pieces optimize contact between your skin and an exposed power conductor, or between two power conductors.</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> What kinds of tools are best for working on live power circuits? <em>Tools with electrically-insulated handles.</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> What kind of immediate medical attention does an electric shock victim require? <em>CPR if they are not breathing or their heart is not beating.</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> What footwear is appropriate when working around electric power? <em>Closed-toed work boots or shoes with good, thick, insulating soles.</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> What footwear is <strong>not</strong> appropriate when working around electric power? <em>Sandals, flip-flops, or other shoes exposing the skin.</em></p>
<p>The safety concern of jewelry worn around electric circuits is not limited to high voltages where shock is possible. It is also a concern around low-voltage circuits where high current through a ring or bracelet (caused by bridging two conductors with the jewelry) can cause the jewelry to heat up and burn the skin.</p>
