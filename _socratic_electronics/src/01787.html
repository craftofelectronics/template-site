<p>Combining Lenz’s Law with the right-hand rule (or left-hand rule, if you follow electron flow instead of conventional flow) provides a simple and effective means for determining the direction of induced current in an induction coil. In the following examples, trace the direction of current through the load resistor:</p>

<p>Note: in case it isn’t clear from the illustrations, Figures 1 through 4 show the magnet moving in relation to a stationary coil. Figures 5 and 6 show a coil moving in relation to a stationary magnet.</p>

<p>An easy way I find to remember Lenz’s Law is to interpret is as <em>opposition to change</em>. The coil will try to become a magnet that fights the motion. A good way to get students thinking along these lines is to ask them, &quot;What magnetic polarity would the coil have to assume (in each case) to resist the magnet’s relative motion?&quot; In other words, if the magnet moves closer to the coil, the coil will &quot;magnetize&quot; so as to push against the magnet. If the magnet moves away from the coil, the coil will &quot;magnetize&quot; so as to attract the magnet.</p>
