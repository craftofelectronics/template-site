<p>Bipolar junction transistor (BJT) function is usually considered in terms of currents: a relatively small current through one of the transistorâ€™s terminals exerts control over a much larger current. Draw the directions of all currents for these two transistors (one NPN and one PNP), clearly identifying which of the currents is <em>doing</em> the control, and which of the currents is <em>being</em> controlled:</p>

<p>I have heard questions of this sort asked on technician job interviews. Knowing which way currents go through a BJT is considered a very fundamental aspect of electronics technician knowledge, and for good reason. It is impossible to understand the function of many transistor circuits without a firm grasp on which signal exerts control over which other signal in a circuit.</p>
