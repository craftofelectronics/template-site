<p>While Class A amplifier circuits are simpler to design and build, they are rarely used for high-power applications. Why is this? Why are Class B amplifier designs much more popular for high-power applications? Would it be practical for you to build a microphone amplifier such as this using nothing but Class A circuitry?</p>
<p>Class A amplifiers are much less <em>efficient</em> than Class B amplifiers: a great deal more of the electrical power energizing the circuit gets wasted in the form of heat.</p>
<p>Discuss with your students the practicality of a Class A audio power amplifier for the scope of this project. Just because I made Class B circuitry a requirement of this project does not mean a Class A amplifier design would be completely impractical. One of my goals in writing this design project was to get students experienced with Class B push-pull circuits, which are more challenging to design and build than Class A.</p>
