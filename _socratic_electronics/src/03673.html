<p>A very common misconception students have about potentiometers is the relationship between resistance and direction of wiper motion. For instance, it is common to hear a student say something like this, “Turning the potentiometer so the wiper moves <em>up</em> will increase the resistance of the potentiometer.”</p>

<p>Explain why it does not really make sense to say something like this.</p>
<p>Moving a potentiometer wiper changes <em>two</em> resistances in complementary directions: one resistance will increase as the other will decrease.</p>
<p>Ask your students to identify which resistance (which two connection points on the potentiometer) increases and which decreases, and how they know this from the &quot;internal views&quot; of the potentiometers. This is a very important thing for your students to learn.</p>
<p>Year after year of teaching has revealed that a great many students have difficulty grasping this concept. This is especially true when they become accustomed to using a potentiometer as a rheostat and not as a voltage divider. The more you can make them think carefully about the operation of a potentiometer, the better!</p>
