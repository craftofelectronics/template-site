<p>The purpose of this circuit is to provide indication of when the rotary encoder shaft is in a particular position (matching the setting of the 8-position switch array):</p>

<p>Trace the directions of all currents in this circuit, <em>using electron flow notation</em>, when the encoder position matches the pre-set code entered at the switches. Then, identify specific component failures that could result in the solenoid coil not energizing in this condition.</p>

<p>Potential component faults resulting in non-energization of solenoid:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> MOSFET failed open (drain-to-source)</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Broken wire between MOSFET drain and solenoid coil</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Loss of power (<span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>C</em><em>C</em></sub></span>) to comparator circuit</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Loss of power to encoder (only if switch code is <em>not</em> 0000 0000)</p>
<p>Discuss fault options with your students, asking them to explain <em>why</em> each proposed fault would result in the solenoid not energizing.</p>
