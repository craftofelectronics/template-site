<p>Use circuit simulation software to verify your predicted and measured parameter values.</p>
<p>Use a sine-wave function generator for the AC voltage source. Specify standard resistor, capacitor, and inductor values. I have used a small 100 mH inductor, a 0.033 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>F capacitor, and 100 <span class="math">Ω </span> resistor with good success. In any case I recommend keeping the resonant frequency within the mid-audio range (1 kHz to 10 kHz) to avoid problems with low inductor <span class="math"><em>Q</em></span> (frequency too low) and stray capacitance and inductance issues (frequency too high).</p>
