<p>Calculate the output voltages of this Wien bridge circuit, if the input voltage is 10 volts RMS at a frequency of 159.155 Hz:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01213x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math">$V_{out1} = 5.00 \hbox{ VAC RMS } \angle \&gt; 0^o$</span></p>
<p><span class="math">$V_{out2} = 3.33 \hbox{ VAC RMS } \angle \&gt; 0^o$</span></p>
<p>This question provides an excellent opportunity for your students to review AC circuit analysis, as well as pave the way for questions regarding Wien bridge oscillator circuits!</p>
