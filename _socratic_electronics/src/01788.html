<p>Determine the polarity of the coil’s induced voltage for each of the following examples. Be careful to note the direction each coil is wrapped around its core – the coils are not all identical!</p>

<p>It might help students to visualize the polarity if they imagine a resistive load connected between the two output terminals, and then figured out which direction induced <em>current</em> would go through that load. Once that determination is made, voltage polarity (considering the coil as an energy source) should be easier to visualize. A mistake many beginning students make when doing this, though, is to fail to recognize the coil as the <em>source</em> of electrical energy and the resistor as the <em>load</em>, so be prepared to address this misunderstanding.</p>
<p>If this does not help, suggest they first identify the magnetic polarity of the coil’s induced field: determine which end of the coil is &quot;trying&quot; to be North and which is &quot;trying&quot; to be South. Of course, no induced field will form unless the coil has a complete circuit to sustain the induced current, but it is still helpful to imagine a load resistor or even a short completing the circuit so that induced current and thus induced magnetic polarity may be visualized.</p>
