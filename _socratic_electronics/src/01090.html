<p>What is required to make a <em>Shockley diode</em> or <em>DIAC</em> begin conducting current? What condition(s) have to be met in order for electrical conduction to occur through one of these devices?</p>
<p>Also, explain what must be done to stop the flow of electric current through a Shockley diode or a DIAC.</p>
<p>Turn on: voltage drop across device must exceed a certain threshold voltage (the <em>breakover voltage</em>) before conduction occurs.</p>
<p>Turn off: current through the device must be brought to a minimum level before the device stops conducting (<em>low-current dropout</em>).</p>
<p>Although the answer may seem obvious to many, it is worthwhile to ask your students how the behavior of a Shockley diode compares to that of a normal (rectifying) diode. The fact that the Shockley diode is called a &quot;diode&quot; at all may have fooled some of your students into thinking that it behaves much like a normal diode.</p>
<p>Ask you students to explain how these two devices (Shockley diodes versus rectifying diodes) are similar. In what ways are they different?</p>
<p>Another good discussion question to bring up is the difference between a <em>Shockley</em> diode and a <em>Schottky</em> diode. Although the names are very similar, the two devices are definitely not!</p>
