<p>What is a <em>harmonic</em> frequency? If a particular electronic system (such as an AC power system) has a fundamental frequency of 60 Hz, calculate the frequencies of the following harmonics:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> 1st harmonic =</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> 2nd harmonic =</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> 3rd harmonic =</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> 4th harmonic =</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> 5th harmonic =</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> 6th harmonic =</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> 1st harmonic = 60 Hz</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> 2nd harmonic = 120 Hz</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> 3rd harmonic = 180 Hz</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> 4th harmonic = 240 Hz</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> 5th harmonic = 300 Hz</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> 6th harmonic = 360 Hz</p>
<p>Ask your students to determine the mathematical relationship between harmonic number, harmonic frequency, and fundamental frequency. It isn’t difficult to figure out!</p>
