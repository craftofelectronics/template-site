<p>Calculate the total current output to the load resistor by this set of parallel-connected current sources:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01737x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Also, calculate the voltage dropped across <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>l</em><em>o</em><em>a</em><em>d</em></sub></span>.</p>
<p>The total current in this circuit is 4 mA, and the load voltage is 18.8 volts.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: indicate the polarity of the voltage across the load resistor with &quot;+&quot; and &quot;-&quot; symbols.</p>
<p>Have your students collectively agree on a procedure they may use to accurate discern series voltage sums and polarities. Guide their discussion, helping them identify principles that are true and valid for all series circuits.</p>
