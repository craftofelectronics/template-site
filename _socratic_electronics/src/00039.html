<p>Rank these five light bulb assemblies according to their <em>total</em> electrical resistance (in order of least to greatest), assuming that each of the bulbs is the same type and rating:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00039x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Explain how you determined the relative resistances of these light bulb networks.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> C (least total resistance)</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> D</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> A</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> E</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> B (greatest total resistance)</p>
<p>I prefer to enter discussion on series and parallel circuits prior to introducing Ohm’s Law. Conceptual analysis tends to be more difficult than numerical analysis in electric circuits, but is a skill worthwhile to build, especially for the sake of effective troubleshooting.</p>
<p>It is effective <em>after</em> conceptual (qualitative) analysis, though, to go through a numerical (quantitative) analysis of a circuit like this to prove that the concepts are correct, if the students are advanced enough at this point to do series-parallel resistance calculations.</p>
