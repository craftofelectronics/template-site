<p>What are <em>blind</em> and <em>buried</em> vias, compared to normal vias?</p>
<p>A &quot;blind&quot; via is one that connects a surface layer to an inner layer of a multi-layer PCB. A &quot;buried&quot; via is one that does not appear on any surface layer at all, but rather goes between inner layers.</p>
<p>One students grasp the concept of a multi-layer board, the necessity of different types of vias will become obvious. Asking this question, then, is just one more way to communicate the concept of a multi-layer board.</p>
