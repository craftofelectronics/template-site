<p>Study this audio amplifier circuit closely:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01593x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Then, determine whether the DC voltage at each test point (<span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>T</em><em>P</em>1</sub></span> through <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>T</em><em>P</em>6</sub></span>) with respect to ground will increase, decrease, or remain the same for each of the given fault conditions:</p>
<p><span class="math"></span><span class="math"></span> When analyzing component faults, consider only one fault at a time. That is, for each row in the table, you should analyze the circuit as though the only fault in it is the one listed in the far left column of that row.</p>
<p>If the voltage changes to zero, I show <span class="math">0</span> in the table. If the increase or decrease is relatively small, I use thin arrows (<span class="math"> ↑ </span> or <span class="math"> ↓ </span>). If the change is great, I use thick arrows (<span class="math"> ⇑ </span> or <span class="math"> ⇓ </span>).</p>
<p><span class="math"></span><span class="math"></span></p>
<p>Follow-up question: why don’t test point voltages <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>T</em><em>P</em>1</sub></span> or <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>T</em><em>P</em>6</sub></span> ever change?</p>
<p>I was able to verify specific voltages by building this circuit and faulting each component as described. Although I was not always able to predict the magnitude of the change, I could always predict the direction. This is really all that should be expected of beginning students.</p>
<p>The really important aspect of this question is for students to understand <em>why</em> the test point voltages change as they do. Discuss each fault with your students, and how one can predict the effects just by looking at the circuit.</p>
