<p>This vocal eliminator circuit used to work just fine, but then one day it stopped eliminating the vocal track. The tone of the music sounded a bit heavy on the bass, and the vocal track was there when it shouldnâ€™t have been there:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03797x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Identify the following fault possibilities:</p>
<p>One resistor failure (either open or shorted) that could cause this to happen:</p>
<p>One opamp failure that could cause this to happen:</p>
<p>For each of these proposed faults, explain <em>why</em> the bass tones would be lost.</p>
<p>Please note that the following list is not exhaustive. That is, other component faults may be possible!</p>
<p>One resistor failure (either open or shorted) that could cause this to happen: <em><span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span> failed open.</em></p>
<p>One opamp failure that could cause this to happen: <em><span class="math"><em>U</em><sub>2</sub></span> failed.</em></p>
<p>Ask your students to explain how they identified their proposed faults, and also how they were able to identify component that <em>must</em> still be working properly.</p>
