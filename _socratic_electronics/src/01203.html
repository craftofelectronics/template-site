<p>Explain why binary is a natural numeration system for expressing numbers in electronic circuits. Why not decimal or some other base of numeration?</p>
<p>How do you suspect binary numbers may be <em>stored</em> in electronic systems, for future retrieval? What advantages are there to the use of binary numeration in storage systems?</p>
<p>The two states of an on/off circuit are equivalent to 0 and 1 ciphers in binary. Any medium in which on/off states may be physically represented is applicable to storing binary numbers. Optical disks (CD-ROM, DVD) are an excellent example of this, with laser-burned &quot;pits&quot; representing binary bits.</p>
<p>Ask your students to think of different media or physical quantities which may represent binary information, especially those related to electric/electronic circuits.</p>
