<p>Plot the transfer function (<span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>o</em><em>u</em><em>t</em></sub></span> versus <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>i</em><em>n</em></sub></span>) for this opamp circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01017x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>What type of mathematical function is represented by this circuit?</p>
<p>This circuit (ideally) represents a <em>linear</em> function (<span class="math"><em>y</em> ∝ <em>x</em></span>):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01017x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>It should be obvious from inspection that the two opamp circuits represent inverse mathematical functions. Ask your students why the final transfer function is linear rather than nonlinear. After all, they should realize that each of the opamp circuits, taken individually, are very nonlinear. Why would their combined effect be linear?</p>
<p>An interesting exercise would be to have your students perform inverse functions like this on their hand calculators, first calculating an exponential function (<span class="math"><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) = <em>e</em><sup><em>x</em></sup></span>), then a logarithmic (<span class="math"><em>g</em>(<em>x</em>) = ln<em>x</em></span>), and verifying the combined functions’ output (<span class="math"><em>f</em>[<em>g</em>(<em>x</em>)] = <em>x</em></span>).</p>
