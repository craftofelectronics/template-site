<p>In solitary atoms, electrons are free to inhabit only certain, discrete energy states. However, in solid materials where there are many atoms in close proximity to each other, <em>bands</em> of energy states form. Explain what it means for there to be an energy &quot;band&quot; in a solid material, and why these &quot;bands&quot; form.</p>
<p>Pauliâ€™s Exclusion Principle states that &quot;No two electrons in close proximity may inhabit the exact same quantum state.&quot; Therefore, when lots of atoms are packed together in close proximity, their individual electron states shift energy levels slightly to become continuous <em>bands</em> of energy levels.</p>
<p>Ask your students to think of analogies to illustrate this principle. Where else do we see multiple, individual entities joining together to form a larger (continuous) whole?</p>
