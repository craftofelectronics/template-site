<p>Write the mathematical formula defining <span class="math"><em>β</em></span> for a bipolar junction transistor:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\beta = \hbox{\hskip 100pt}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\beta = {I_C \over I_B}$</span><br /></p>
<p>This definition may be found in any introductory electronics textbook, so you should ask you students to explain something about this formula in order to make it a meaningful discussion question. Suitable explanations to request would be:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> What are some typical values for <span class="math"><em>β</em></span>?</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Is <span class="math"><em>β</em></span> always greater than 1 or less than 1? What does this suggest about the two transistor currents in the formula?</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> What would the <span class="math"><em>β</em></span> value be for an <em>ideal</em> transistor?</p>
