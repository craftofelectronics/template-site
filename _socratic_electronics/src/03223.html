<p>Electrochemical batteries are supposed to act as constant voltage sources, outputting an unchanging voltage for a wide range of load currents. The output voltage of real batteries, though, always &quot;sags&quot; to some degree under the influence of a load.</p>
<p>Explain why this is so, in terms of modeling the battery as an ideal voltage source combined with a resistance. How do you suggest the internal resistance of a chemical battery be experimentally measured?</p>

<p>Iâ€™ll let you figure out how to measure this internal resistance!</p>
<p>Although real chemical batteries do not respond as simply as this equivalent circuit would suggest, the model is accurate enough for many purposes.</p>
