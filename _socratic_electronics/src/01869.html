<p>An alternative to &quot;tank circuit&quot; combinations of <span class="math"><em>L</em></span> and <span class="math"><em>C</em></span> in many electronic circuits is a small device known as a <em>crystal</em>. Explain how a &quot;crystal&quot; may take the place of a tank circuit, and how it functions.</p>
<p>Crystals are mechanical resonators made of a piezoelectric material (usually quartz).</p>
<p>My answer here is purposefully vague, to inspire students to research on their own.</p>
