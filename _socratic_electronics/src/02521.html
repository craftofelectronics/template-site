<p>An important parameter of any differential amplifier – bare opamps and difference amplifiers made from opamps alike – is <em>common-mode rejection</em>, or CMR. Explain what this parameter means, how the following circuit tests this parameter, and why it is important to us:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02521x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>CMR measures the degree to which a differential amplifier ignores common-mode signals.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: what range of CMR values would you expect from a good differential amplifier, if subjected to the test shown in the schematic and CMR calculated by the given formula?</p>
<p>In case some students do not recall (!), the logarithmic formula is nothing special. It simply provides an answer in units of decibels.</p>
