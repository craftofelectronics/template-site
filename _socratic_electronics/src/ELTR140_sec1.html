<p>Question 56: Sample project grading criteria</p>
<p><strong>ELTR 140 (Digital 1), section 1</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Uses a comparator and at least one logic gate to drive three LEDs: &quot;High&quot;, &quot;Low&quot;, and &quot;Indeterminate&quot;, showing three different voltage levels detected at the probe. The thresholds for high and low logic levels shall be adjustable for use in different types of logic circuits.</p>
<p>Drives a solenoid or other power device only when the input code matches the &quot;key&quot; code (set by a series of switches on the circuit board), and drives an alarm siren if the input code does <em>not</em> match the &quot;key&quot; code. The logic function may be done with Exclusive-OR gates or with a magnitude comparator IC. Remember, the more bits in the codes, the harder it is to guess!</p>

<p>It is vitally important for students to understand the conditions necessary for transistor operation, both for understanding how circuits work and for troubleshooting faulty circuits. Bipolar junction transistors require a base current (in the proper direction) to conduct, and the collector-to-emitter voltage must be of the correct polarity to push a collector current in the proper direction as well. Both currents join at the emitter terminal, making the emitter current the sum of the base and collector currents. Field-effect transistors are not so picky about the direction of the controlled current, and they only require the correct gate voltage (no gate current) to establish conduction. What makes this so confusing is that there are two types of bipolar transistors (NPN and PNP), two types of junction field-effect transistors (N-channel and P-channel), and four types of MOSFETs (E-type N-channel, E-type P-channel, D-type N-channel, and D-type P-channel).</p>
<p>It is very common in electronics work to refer to current-controlling devices as either <em>sourcing</em> current to a load or <em>sinking</em> current from a load. This is an overt reference to conventional-flow notation, referring to whether the conventional flow moves <em>out</em> of the transistor from the positive power supply terminal to the load (sourcing), or whether the conventional flow moves <em>in</em> to the transistor from the load and then &quot;down&quot; to ground (sinking). Some students grasp this concept readily, while others seem to struggle mightily with it. It is something rather essential to understand, because this terminology is extensively used by electronics professionals and found in electronics literature. The key detail distinguishing the two conditions is which power supply rail (either +V or Gnd) is <em>directly</em> connected to the current-controlling device.</p>
<p>In digital circuits, resistors are often used to provide a secure logic state when an input device (such as a switch) goes to a high-impedance (open) mode. Students often have difficulty figuring out exactly where these resistors should go in a circuit. The most common mistake I’ve seen is to place one of these &quot;pullup&quot; or &quot;pulldown&quot; resistors in <em>series</em> with a gate input, which will accomplish absolutely nothing. The &quot;trick&quot; to getting this placement right, if you can call it a trick at all, is to literally follow the word &quot;pullup&quot; or &quot;pulldown.&quot; A <em>pullup</em> resistor pulls the logic state of a wire up to the positive supply rail, and so must connect between the gate input and +V. A <em>pulldown</em> resistor pulls the logic state of a wire down to ground potential, and so must connect between the gate input and ground. In either case, the resistor provides a sure path to the opposite power rail that the input device connects to when active (closed).</p>
