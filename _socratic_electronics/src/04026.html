<p>Modify the circuit shown to use a 555 monostable timer instead of a J-K flip-flop at the output of the comparator.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{04026x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Also, explain the significance of reversing the comparator’s input connections (as compared to the schematic shown on the front page of this worksheet). Why is it better to do this, if we are triggering a monostable 555 timer circuit?</p>
<p>I’ll let you and your classmates figure out the answer(s) to this question.</p>
<p>Nothing to note here.</p>
