<p>Explain why high-speed transistor or thyristor switching of power (on and off) to a load is a more efficient method of power control than a variable resistance placed in series with a load.</p>
<p>A series power control resistance would dissipate substantial power (wasted energy), whereas a transistor or thyristor operating only in the opposite conditions of cutoff and saturation will dissipate very little power in either state.</p>
