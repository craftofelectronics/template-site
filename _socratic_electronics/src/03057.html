<p>A <em>function</em> is a mathematical relationship with an input (usually <span class="math"><em>x</em></span>) and an output (usually <span class="math"><em>y</em></span>). Here is an example of a simple function:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math"><em>y</em> = 2<em>x</em> + 1</span><br /></p>
<p>One way to show the pattern of any given function is with a table of numbers. Complete this table for the given values of <span class="math"><em>x</em></span>:</p>
<p><span class="math"></span><span class="math"></span> A more common (and intuitive) way to show the pattern of any given function is with a <em>graph</em>. Complete this graph for the same function <span class="math"><em>y</em> = 2<em>x</em> + 1</span>. Consider each division on the axes to be 1 unit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03057x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math"></span><br /><span class="math"></span><br /><span class="math"></span></p>
<p>It is very important for your students to understand graphs, as they are very frequently used to illustrate the behavior of circuits and mathematical functions alike. Discuss with them how the line represents a continuous string of points and not just the integer values calculated in the table.</p>
