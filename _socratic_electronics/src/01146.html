<p>Define the following terms, as they relate to phase-locked loop circuits:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Center frequency</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Lock range</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Capture range</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Lock-up time</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Center frequency: the &quot;free-running&quot; frequency of a PLL’s voltage-controlled oscillator.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Lock range: the range of input signal frequencies that a PLL is able to remain &quot;locked in&quot; to.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Capture range: the range of input signal frequencies that a PLL is able to lock in to, from an unlocked state.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Lock-up time: the amount of time required for a PLL to &quot;lock in&quot; to a given input frequency, from a cold start.</p>
<p>Ask your students to explain which range – lock or capture – is narrower, and why.</p>
