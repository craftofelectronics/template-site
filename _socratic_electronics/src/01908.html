<p>Suppose an oscilloscope has been set up to display a triangle wave, with the horizontal position control turned clockwise until the left-hand edge of the waveform is visible:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01908x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Then, the technician changes the slope control, changing it from &quot;increasing&quot; to &quot;decreasing&quot;:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01908x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Draw the waveformâ€™s new appearance on the oscilloscope screen, with the slope control reversed.</p>
<p>The waveform will begin at the same voltage level, only on the &quot;down&quot; side instead of on the &quot;up&quot; side:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01908x03.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>There is nothing special about a triangle wave here. To be perfectly honest, it was the easiest waveform for me to draw which had a sloping edge to trigger on!</p>
<p>By the way, for students to really understand how triggering works, it is important for them to spend time &quot;playing&quot; with an oscilloscope and a signal generator trying things like this. There is only so much one can learn about the operation of a machine by reading!</p>
