<p>Connect the necessary wires in this illustration to make the potentiometer act as a variable voltage divider, providing a variable voltage to the voltmeter:</p>

<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00322x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Hereâ€™s a hint for those unfamiliar with the internal construction of rotary potentiometers:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00322x03.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>A good follow-up question to this would be to ask your students which way the potentiometer knob needs to be turned in order to <em>increase</em> the voltage applied to the meter.</p>
