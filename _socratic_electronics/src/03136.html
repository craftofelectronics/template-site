<p>Suppose you needed to build a circuit that pulsed a lamp on and off (once) when a pushbutton is pressed and held. In other words, you wanted the lamp to do this:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03136x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Draw a ladder logic diagram for a circuit that would fulfill this function, using at least one time-delay relay.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03136x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>This is a good problem-solving exercise, figuring out how to creatively combine time-delay relays to perform a specific function.</p>
