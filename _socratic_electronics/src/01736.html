<p>Calculate the total current output to the load resistor by this set of parallel-connected current sources:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01736x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Also, calculate the voltage dropped across <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>l</em><em>o</em><em>a</em><em>d</em></sub></span>.</p>
<p>The total current in this circuit is 27 mA, and the load voltage is 40.5 volts.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: trace the direction of current through all three sources as well as the load resistor. Compare these directions with the polarity of their shared voltage. Explain how the relationship between voltage polarity and current direction relates to each componentâ€™s identity as either a <em>source</em> or a <em>load</em>.</p>
<p>Have your students collectively agree on a procedure they may use to accurate discern series voltage sums and polarities. Guide their discussion, helping them identify principles that are true and valid for all series circuits.</p>
