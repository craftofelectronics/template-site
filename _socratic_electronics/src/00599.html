<p>Explain what <em>surface-mount devices</em> are, and how the soldering and desoldering processes for them differ from the processes used to solder and de-solder &quot;through-hole&quot; components on printed circuit boards. The following illustration contrasts &quot;through-hole&quot; component construction versus surface-mount construction for a voltage divider circuit (three resistors connected in series):</p>

<p>&quot;Surface-mount&quot; components solder to the surface of a printed circuit board, and have no mechanical means of attachment, unlike &quot;through-hole&quot; components. Because of their small size and lack of attachment prior to soldering, special soldering equipment must be used.</p>
<p>Ask your students to describe some of the special soldering equipment that must be used for surface-mount devices? How does it differ in terms of power from regular soldering irons and guns? Why are surface-mount soldering tools rated at a different power level?</p>
<p>Ask your students to describe how surface-mount components may be held to the board during the soldering process. Are all surface-mount components identical, or are there different types? What special soldering tool attachments are available for working with surface-mount devices?</p>
