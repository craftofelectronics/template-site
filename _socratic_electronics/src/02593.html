<p>Define &quot;Gain-Bandwidth Product&quot; (GBW) as the term applies to operational amplifiers.</p>
<p>GBW product is a constant value for most operational amplifiers, equal to the open-loop gain of the opamp multiplied by the signal frequency at that gain.</p>
<p>There are other means of defining Gain-Bandwidth Product, so do not be surprised if students present alternative definitions during the discussion time.</p>
