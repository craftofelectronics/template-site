<p>If quantitative accuracy is desired from this curve tracing circuit, the shunt resistor should be <em>precisely</em> 1 k<span class="math">Ω </span> in size. Explain how a precise shunt resistance may be built without the use of precision components (i.e. a special 1 k<span class="math">Ω </span> precision resistor).</p>
<p>Hint: there’s a saying in the electronics world that goes something like this: <em>&quot;Don’t make it precise, make it adjustable!&quot;</em></p>
<p>Though it may have been a while since you last discussed how to achieve precise (adjustable!) values of resistance from non-precision resistors, students should at least remember the general concept if not the exact implementation.</p>
