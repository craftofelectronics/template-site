<p>When &quot;P&quot; and &quot;N&quot; type semiconductor pieces are brought into close contact, free electrons from the &quot;N&quot; piece will rush over to fill holes in the &quot;P&quot; piece, creating a zone on both sides of the contact region devoid of charge carriers. What is this zone called, and what are its electrical characteristics?</p>
<p>This is called the <em>depletion region</em>, and it is essentially an insulator at room temperatures.</p>
<p>Students should know that both &quot;N&quot; and &quot;P&quot; type semiconductors are electrically conductive. So, when a depletion region forms in the contact zone between two differing semiconductor types, the conductivity from end-to-end must be affected. Ask your students what this effect is, and what factors may influence it.</p>
