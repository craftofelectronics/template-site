<p>A <em>solder mask</em> is a very important feature on professional-quality printed circuit boards. Explain what a solder mask is, and why it is so important.</p>
<p>A &quot;solder mask&quot; is a thin coating of polymer covering every part of the board except for those spots where you intend it to be soldered. A solder mask is absolutely essential if the board is to be wave soldered!</p>
<p>Follow-up question: what is the <em>mask expansion</em> dimension on a PCB?</p>
<p>Anyone who has ever worked with a home-made, bare-copper (etched) PCB will appreciate the function of a solder mask, even when the soldering is all done by hand.</p>
