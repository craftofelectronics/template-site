<p>Explain how this electrical system functions in a similar manner to a laboratory &quot;balance&quot; scale:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00524x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The circle with the letter &quot;G&quot; in it is a symbol for a <em>galvanometer</em>. What practical purpose might a system like this serve?</p>
<p>The galvanometer registers zero if and only if the two voltage sources are precisely equal.</p>
<p>The first question your students are likely to ask is, &quot;What is a <em>galvanometer</em>?&quot; Let them do the research on this question! The answer is easy to find.</p>
<p>Next, your students will have to explain how this system may be used to do something practical. Just as a laboratory balance-beam serves the purpose of measuring mass, this system also measures something. Challenge your students to draw analogies between the components of this system and the components of a laboratory balance. What essential feature must the <span class="math"><em>E</em><sub><em>s</em><em>t</em><em>a</em><em>n</em><em>d</em><em>a</em><em>r</em><em>d</em></sub></span> voltage source have in order for this to be a useful measurement system?</p>
