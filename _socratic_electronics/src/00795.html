<p>A technician is troubleshooting a power supply circuit with no DC output voltage. The output voltage is supposed to be 15 volts DC:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00795x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The technician begins making voltage measurements between some of the test points (TP) on the circuit board. What follows is a sequential record of his measurements:</p>
<p>1. <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>T</em><em>P</em>9 − <em>T</em><em>P</em>10</sub> = </span> 0 volts DC</p>
<p>2. <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>T</em><em>P</em>8 − <em>T</em><em>P</em>7</sub> = </span> 0 volts DC</p>
<p>3. <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>T</em><em>P</em>8 − <em>T</em><em>P</em>5</sub> = </span> 0 volts DC</p>
<p>4. <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>T</em><em>P</em>6 − <em>T</em><em>P</em>7</sub> = </span> 0 volts DC</p>
<p>5. <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>T</em><em>P</em>4 − <em>T</em><em>P</em>5</sub> = </span> 0 volts AC</p>
<p>6. <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>T</em><em>P</em>1 − <em>T</em><em>P</em>3</sub> = </span> 0 volts AC</p>
<p>7. <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>T</em><em>P</em>1 − <em>T</em><em>P</em>2</sub> = </span> 116 volts AC</p>
<p>Based on these measurements, what do you suspect has failed in this supply circuit? Explain your answer. Also, critique this technician’s troubleshooting technique and make your own suggestions for a more efficient pattern of steps.</p>
<p>The fuse is blown open.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: with regard to the troubleshooting technique, this technician seems to have started from one end of the circuit and moved incrementally toward the other, checking voltage at almost every point in between. Can you think of a more efficient strategy than to start at one end and work slowly toward the other?</p>
<p>Troubleshooting scenarios are always good for stimulating class discussion. Be sure to spend plenty of time in class with your students developing efficient and logical diagnostic procedures, as this will assist them greatly in their careers.</p>
