<p>Solve for values of <span class="math"><em>x</em></span> and <span class="math"><em>y</em></span> that will satisfy both of the following equations at the same time:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math"><em>x</em> + 2<em>y</em> = 9</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">4<em>x</em> − <em>y</em> =  − 18</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math"><em>x</em> =  − 3</span> <span class="math"><em>y</em> = 6</span></p>
<p>Follow-up question: solve this system of simultaneous equations using both substitution (solving for one variable in one of the equations and substituting that into the other equation) and addition (adding the two equations together to produce a third equation with only one unknown).</p>
<p>Nothing special here – just practice solving for a two-variable system of equations.</p>
