<p>An electromechanical meter movement commonly used to measure AC power is called the <em>electrodynamometer movement</em>. Describe how this meter works, and draw a schematic diagram showing how it is used to measure the AC power delivered to a load.</p>
<p>Electrodynamometer movements have two electromagnet coils rather than just one:</p>
