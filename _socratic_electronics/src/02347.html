<p>Identify three different ways that an SCR or a TRIAC may be triggered into its &quot;on&quot; (conducting) state:</p>
<p><span class="math">1. </span></p>
<p><span class="math">2. </span></p>
<p><span class="math">3. </span></p>
<p><span class="math">1. </span> Applying a voltage pulse at the gate terminal</p>
<p><span class="math">2. </span> Exceeding the anode-to-cathode &quot;breakover&quot; voltage</p>
<p><span class="math">3. </span> Exceeding the &quot;critical rate of rise&quot; for anode-cathode voltage (<span class="math">$dv \over dt$</span>)</p>
<p>Although gate triggering is by far the most common method of initiating conduction through SCRs and TRIACs, it is important that students realize it is not the only way. The other two methods, both involving voltage applied between the anode and cathode terminals (or MT1-MT2 terminals) of the device, are often <em>accidental</em> means of triggering.</p>
<p>Be sure to discuss with your students the reason <em>why</em> excessive <span class="math">${dv \over dt}$</span> can trigger a thyristor, based on an examination of inter-electrode capacitance within the transistors of a thyristor model.</p>
