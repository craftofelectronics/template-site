<p>The voltage gain of a common-emitter transistor amplifier is approximately equal to the collector resistance divided by the emitter resistance:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03107x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Knowing this, calculate the necessary resistance values for the following fixed-value resistors (<span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span>) to give this common-emitter amplifier an adjustable voltage gain range of 4 to 7:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03107x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> = 13.33 k<span class="math">Ω </span></p>
<p><span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span> = 3.333 k<span class="math">Ω </span></p>
<p>Have your students show how they set up the system of equations to solve for the two resistor values. This is a good exercise to do in front of the class, so everyone can see (possibly) different methods of solution.</p>
