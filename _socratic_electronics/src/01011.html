<p>Re-write the equation for this differential amplifier circuit, assuming that the marked resistor fails open:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01011x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math"><em>y</em> = 2<em>b</em> − <em>a</em></span></p>
<p>Ask your students to explain how they would verify the failure of the marked resistor, using a voltmeter (not an ohmmeter!).</p>
