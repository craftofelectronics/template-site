<p>Design a circuit with a three-position switch, where one position charges a capacitor, one position holds the capacitor’s voltage constant, and the last position discharges the capacitor. Provide independent, variable adjustments for charging and discharging time constants.</p>
<p>The following circuit does not meet all the design criteria, but it gives you an idea of where to begin in your design:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00443x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>This is an interesting question, as the students are challenged with the design of a circuit, and that the example circuit shown in the answer does not completely fulfill the specified criteria. In order for a student to derive a circuit from the one given in the answer, they must first assess that circuit’s operation, to determine what it can and cannot do.</p>
<p>Note that it will not suffice to merely replace the fixed-value resistor with a variable resistor, as this would not provide <em>independent</em> adjustment of charging and discharging time constants.</p>
