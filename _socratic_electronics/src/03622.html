<p>Many single-phase &quot;squirrel-cage&quot; induction motors use a special <em>start winding</em> which is energized only at low (or no) speed. When the rotor reaches full operating speed, the starting switch opens to de-energize the start winding:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03622x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Explain why this special winding is necessary for the motor to start, and also why there is a capacitor connected in series with this start winding. What would happen if the start switch, capacitor, or start winding were to fail open?</p>
<p>Single-phase AC has no definite direction of &quot;rotation&quot; like polyphase AC does. Consequently, a second, phase-shifted magnetic field must be generated in order to give the rotor a starting torque.</p>
<p>Challenge question: explain what you would have to do to reverse the direction of this &quot;capacitor-start&quot; motor.</p>
<p>Capacitor-start squirrel-cage induction motors are very popular in applications where there is a need for high starting torque. Many induction motor shop tools (drill presses, lathes, radial-arm saws, air compressors) use capacitor-start motors.</p>
