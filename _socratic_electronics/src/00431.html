<p>Replace the fixed-value resistor with a potentiometer to adjust the blinking rate of the neon lamp, in this <em>relaxation oscillator</em> circuit. Connect the potentiometer in such a way that clockwise rotation of the knob makes the lamp blink faster:</p>

<p>Ask your students to explain <em>why</em> the potentiometer has the speed-changing effect it does on the circuit’s flash rate. Would there be any other way to change this circuit’s flash rate, without using a potentiometer?</p>
