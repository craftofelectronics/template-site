<p>According to the Barkhausen criterion for a sine-wave oscillator, the total loop voltage gain needs to be 1. Explain what will happen in these two conditions:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> The total loop voltage gain is less than one</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> The total loop voltage gain is greater than one</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> The total loop voltage gain is less than one, (<em>the oscillations will die out</em>)</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> The total loop voltage gain is greater than one, (<em>the oscillations will become distorted</em>)</p>
