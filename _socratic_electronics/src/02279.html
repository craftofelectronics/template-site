<p>A radio antenna possesses both parasitic capacitance and distributed inductance, distributed along its entire length:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02279x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Ideally, an antenna <em>only</em> exhibits these electrical properties, with no resistance. What does this suggest about the electrical behavior of an antenna, especially compared to the behavior of other LC circuits you are familiar with?</p>
<p>A radio antenna has a <em>resonant frequency</em>, just like an LC circuit.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: what physical variable(s) determines the resonant frequency of an antenna?</p>
<p>It is important for students to be able to relate new information to that which they already understand. By likening an antenna to an LC (resonant) circuit, students should be able to predict something about the behavior of antennae, and why it is important to match an antenna to the frequency of transmission.</p>
