<p>Plot the relationship between power and current for a 2 <span class="math">Ω </span> resistor on this graph:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00087x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>What pattern do you see represented by plot? How does this compare with the graphical relationship between <em>voltage</em> and current for a resistor?</p>
<p>The more current through the resistor, the more power dissipated. However, this is <em>not</em> a linear function!</p>
<p>Students need to become comfortable with graphs, and creating their own simple graphs is an excellent way to develop this understanding. A graphical representation of the Ohm’s Law (actually, Joule’s Law) power function allows students another &quot;view&quot; of the concept.</p>
<p>If students have access to either a graphing calculator or computer software capable of drawing 2-dimensional graphs, encourage them to plot the functions using these technological resources.</p>
