<p>At the heart of an FM transmitter is a circuit called a <em>voltage-controlled oscillator</em>, or <em>VCO</em>. Explain what the purpose of a VCO is, and how this directly relates to frequency modulation.</p>
<p>A VCO generates an AC output signal whose frequency is proportional to an externally-supplied input voltage.</p>
<p>Note to your students that VCO circuits are not just used in FM radio transmission. They are also essential to the function of <em>phase-locked loops</em>.</p>
