<p>What is a <em>floating-point</em> number in a digital system?</p>
<p>&quot;Floating-point&quot; numbers are the binary equivalent of scientific notation: certain bits are used to represent the mantissa, another collection of bits represents the exponent, and (usually) there is a single bit representing sign. Unfortunately, there are several different &quot;standards&quot; for representing floating-point numbers.</p>
<p>Ask your students why computer systems would have need for floating point numbers. What’s wrong with the standard forms of binary numbers that we’ve explored thus far?</p>
