<p>Predict how the operation of this thermostat circuit (where the cooling fan motor is supposed to turn on when the temperature gets too high) will be affected as a result of the following faults. Consider each fault independently (i.e. one at a time, no multiple faults):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03769x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Cable fails open:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Comparator <span class="math"><em>U</em><sub>1</sub></span> fails with output saturated positive:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> fails open:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Cable fails shorted:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Transistor <span class="math"><em>Q</em><sub>1</sub></span> fails shorted (drain-to-source):</p>
<p>For each of these conditions, explain <em>why</em> the resulting effects will occur.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Cable fails open: <em>Fan turns on and never turns off.</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Comparator <span class="math"><em>U</em><sub>1</sub></span> fails with output saturated positive: <em>Fan refuses to turn on.</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> fails open: <em>Fan refuses to turn on.</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Cable fails shorted: <em>Fan refuses to turn on.</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Transistor <span class="math"><em>Q</em><sub>1</sub></span> fails shorted (drain-to-source): <em>Fan turns on and never turns off.</em></p>
<p>The purpose of this question is to approach the domain of circuit troubleshooting from a perspective of knowing what the fault is, rather than only knowing what the symptoms are. Although this is not necessarily a realistic perspective, it helps students build the foundational knowledge necessary to diagnose a faulted circuit from empirical data. Questions such as this should be followed (eventually) by other questions asking students to identify likely faults based on measurements.</p>
