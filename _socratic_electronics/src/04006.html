<p>Suppose we were designing a pair of BJT amplifier circuits to connect to either end of a long two-conductor cable, each end coupled to its respective amplifier through a transformer:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{04006x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>How would we choose the component values in each transistor amplifier circuit to naturally terminate both ends of the 75 <span class="math">Ω </span> cable?</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>C</em></sub></span> of the transmitting amplifier should be 1.875 k<span class="math">Ω </span>, as should the parallel equivalent resistance <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>B</em>1</sub>∣∣<em>R</em><sub><em>B</em>2</sub></span> of the receiving amplifier.</p>
<p>This question is really a review of Thévenin’s theorem as it applies to common-emitter, divider-biased BJT amplifier circuits, and also impedance transformation as it applies to step-up and step-down transformers.</p>
<p>In case anyone asks, the &quot;zig-zags&quot; in the four lines for the cable represent an unspecified distance between those points. In other words, the cable is <em>longer</em> than what may be proportionately represented on the schematic diagram.</p>
