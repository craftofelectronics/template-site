<p>When soldering a wire into a metal lug, which of these positions would be considered best for soldering iron and solder?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00558x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Explain why you think one of these positions is better than the others for producing a sound solder connection between the lug and the wire.</p>
<p>The following illustration shows the best positions for iron and solder, when soldering a wire into a lug:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00558x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Discuss with your students why the positions shown in the answer would be superior to the others shown in the question. Keep in mind principles of heat conduction and the necessity for all parts of the connection to be at sufficient temperature as to melt the solder. What, precisely, would be wrong with trying to solder this connection in any of the other ways shown?</p>
