<p>Antique American automobiles often used 6 volt electrical systems instead of the 12 volt components found in more modern cars and trucks. People who restore these old vehicles may have difficulty finding old 6-volt generators and batteries to replace the defective, original units. An easy solution is to update the vehicleâ€™s generator and battery with modern (12 volt) components, but then another problem arises.</p>
<p>A 12 volt generator and 12 volt battery will overpower the old 6 volt headlights, brake lights, and other electrical &quot;loads&quot; in the vehicle. A solution used by antique automobile restorers is to connect resistors between the 12-volt generator system and the 6-volt loads, like this:</p>

<p>Explain why this solution works, and also discuss some of the disadvantages of using resistors to adapt the new (12 volt) to the old (6 volt) components.</p>
<p>The purpose of the resistors is to &quot;drop&quot; half the voltage supplied by the generator and battery, so that the loads (light bulbs, in this case) receive only 6 volts instead of 12 volts. A disadvantage of using resistors to do this is that the resistors waste a lot of electrical power in the form of heat.</p>
<p>Make sure your students understand the concept of a &quot;load:&quot; any electrical or electronic component that uses power from an electrical source. Usually, &quot;loads&quot; are the end-use components of a circuit: light bulbs, motors, solenoids, speakers, etc. In this case, the resistors could be considered loads as well as the light bulbs, but since the light bulbs are the only components performing useful work from the power source, it is customary to think of them when the word &quot;load&quot; is used, rather than the resistors.</p>
