<p>Suppose you had an audio impedance-matching transformer (<span class="math">$1000 \&gt; \Omega \hbox{ to } 8 \&gt; \Omega$</span>), and you wished to know the phase relationships of the windings. Unfortunately, the only test equipment you have is an analog DC voltmeter and a 9-volt battery. Explain how you would use these two devices to test winding &quot;polarity.&quot;</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01562x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Note: you may disregard the center-tap of the <span class="math">1000 Ω </span> primary winding.</p>
<p>I won’t give you the answer directly here, but I will give you a hint: although transformers cannot function on continuous DC, they will respond to <em>pulses</em> of current in a given direction! In other words, you can use intermittent DC from the 9-volt battery to test the windings.</p>
<p>Challenge question: calculate the turns ratio of this transformer, based on the ratio of impedances.</p>
<p>Note that the answer given to this question leaves the particular details of how to interpret the voltmeter readings unanswered. Challenge your students to figure this out on their own.</p>
<p>Audio matching transformers are easy to obtain, so I encourage you have your students try this as a lab exercise.</p>
