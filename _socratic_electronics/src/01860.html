<p>Engineers often calculate the impedance of pure capacitances and pure inductances in a way that directly provides results in rectangular (complex) form:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">${\bf Z}_L = j \omega L$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">${\bf Z}_C = -j {1 \over {\omega C}}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The bold-faced type (<span class="math">${\bf Z}$</span> instead of <span class="math"><em>Z</em></span>) signifies the calculated impedance as a complex rather than a scalar quantity. Given these equations’ forms, what is the mathematical definition of <span class="math"><em>ω</em></span>? In other words, what combination of variables and constants comprise &quot;<span class="math"><em>ω</em></span>&quot;, and what unit is it properly expressed in?</p>
<p>Also, determine what the equations would look like for calculating the impedance of these series networks:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01860x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math"><em>ω</em> = 2<em>π</em><em>f</em></span> is called the <em>angular velocity</em> of the circuit, and it is expressed in units of <em>radians per second</em>.</p>
<p>The impedance equations for the series LR and RC networks are as follows:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">${\bf Z}_{LR} = R + j \omega L$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">${\bf Z}_{RC} = R - j {1 \over {\omega C}}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Students who have taken trigonometry should recognize the <em>radian</em> as a unit for measuring angles. Discuss with your students why multiplying frequency (<span class="math"><em>f</em></span>, cycles per second) by the constant <span class="math">2<em>π</em></span> results in the unit changing to &quot;radians per second&quot;.</p>
<p>Engineers often refer to <span class="math"><em>ω</em></span> as the <em>angular velocity</em> of an AC system. Discuss why the term &quot;velocity&quot; is appropriate for <span class="math"><em>ω</em></span>.</p>
