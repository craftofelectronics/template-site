<p>Add the following eight-bit twoâ€™s complement numbers together, and then convert all binary quantities into decimal form to verify the accuracy of the addition:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01230x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01230x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Follow-up question: Why are some of these answers incorrect? Hint: perform the additions in <em>decimal</em> form rather than binary form, and then explain why those answers are not represented in the binary answers.</p>
<p>This question introduces students to the phenomenon of <em>overflow</em>. This is a very important principle to understand, because real computer systems must deal with this condition properly, so as not to output incorrect answers!</p>
