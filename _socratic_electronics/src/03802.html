<p>The purpose of this circuit is to provide a pushbutton-adjustable voltage. Pressing one button causes the output voltage to increase, while pressing the other button causes the output voltage to decrease. When neither button is pressed, the voltage remains stable. Essentially, it is an active <em>integrator</em> circuit, with resistors <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span> and capacitor <span class="math"><em>C</em><sub>1</sub></span> setting the rates of integration:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03802x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>After working just fine for quite a long while, the circuit suddenly fails: now it only outputs zero volts DC all the time. Identify at least one component or wiring failure that would account for the circuitâ€™s faulty behavior, and explain why that fault would cause the circuit to act like this.</p>
<p>The wire connecting the junction of <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span> with the inverting input of the opamp could be broken open. Also, <span class="math"><em>C</em><sub>1</sub></span> could be failed shorted.</p>
<p>Challenge question: why do you suppose I specify a CA3130 operational amplifier for this particular circuit? What is special about this opamp that qualifies it for the task?</p>
<p>I purposely omitted the explanations for the possible faults listed in the answer, because I want the students to think this through, and to do so in class with you present so you may hear their reasoning.</p>
