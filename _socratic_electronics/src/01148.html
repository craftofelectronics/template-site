<p>A student intends to connect a TL082 opamp as a voltage follower, to &quot;follow&quot; the voltage generated by a potentiometer, but makes a mistake in the breadboard wiring:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01148x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Draw a schematic diagram of this faulty circuit, and determine what the voltmeter’s indication will be, explaining why it is such.</p>
<p>Circuit schematic, as wired:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01148x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The output voltage will saturate at approximately +11 volts, or -11 volts, with the potentiometer having little or no effect.</p>
<p>Ask your students to characterize the type of feedback exhibited in this circuit. How does this type of feedback affect the opamp’s behavior? Is it possible for the opamp to function as a voltage follower, connected like this?</p>
