<p>An AC bridge circuit commonly used to make precision measurements of inductors is the <em>Maxwell-Wien</em> bridge. It uses a combination of standard resistors and capacitors to &quot;balance out&quot; the inductor of unknown value in the opposite arm of the bridge:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00862x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Suppose this bridge circuit balances when <span class="math"><em>C</em><sub><em>s</em></sub></span> is adjusted to 120 nF and <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>s</em></sub></span> is adjusted to 14.25 k<span class="math">Ω </span>. If the source frequency is 400 Hz, and the two fixed-value resistors are 1 k<span class="math">Ω </span> each, calculate the inductance (<span class="math"><em>L</em><sub><em>x</em></sub></span>) and resistance (<span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>x</em></sub></span>) of the inductor being tested.</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>L</em><sub><em>x</em></sub> = </span> 120 mH</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>x</em></sub> = </span> 70.175 <span class="math">Ω </span></p>
<p>There is actually a way to solve for the values of <span class="math"><em>L</em><sub><em>x</em></sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>x</em></sub></span> in a Maxwell-Wien bridge circuit without using complex numbers at all. If one or more of your students find out how to do so through their research, don’t consider it &quot;cheating.&quot; Rather, applaud their research, because they found a quicker path to a solution.</p>
<p>This, of course, doesn’t mean you don’t ask them to work through the problem using complex numbers! The benefit of students researching other means of solution simply provides more alternative solution strategies to the same problem, which is a very good thing.</p>
