<p>A <em>very</em> common application of electromechanical relay logic is motor control circuitry. Here is a ladder diagram for a simple DC motor control, where a momentary pushbutton switch starts the motor, and another pushbutton switch stops the motor:</p>

<p>Translate this ladder diagram into point-to-point connections between the following components (shown in the following illustration):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01295x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The wiring sequence shown here is not the only valid solution to this problem!</p>

<p>This circuit provides students with an opportunity to analyze a simple <em>latch</em>: a system that &quot;remembers&quot; prior switch actuations by holding a &quot;state&quot; (either set or reset; latched or unlatched). A simple motor start/stop circuit such as this is about as simple as latch circuits get.</p>
<p>Students should be able to immediately comprehend the benefit of using nice, neat, structured ladder diagrams when they see the tangled mess of wires in a real motor control circuit. And this is not even a complex motor control circuit! It takes very little imagination to think of something even uglier than this, and what a task it would be to troubleshoot such a circuit without the benefit of a ladder diagram for guidance.</p>
