<p>Suppose a capacitor is charged by a voltage source, and then switched to a resistor for discharging:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01798x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Would a larger capacitance value result in a slower discharge, or a faster discharge? How about a larger resistance value? You may find the &quot;Ohm’s Law&quot; equation for capacitance helpful in answering both these questions:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$i = C {dv \over dt}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Now consider an inductor, &quot;charged&quot; by a current source and then switched to a resistor for discharging:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01798x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Would a larger inductance value result in a slower discharge, or a faster discharge? How about a larger resistance value? You may find the &quot;Ohm’s Law&quot; equation for inductance helpful in answering both these questions:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$v = L {di \over dt}$</span><br /></p>
<p>For the RC circuit:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Larger capacitance = slower discharge</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Larger resistance = slower discharge</p>
<p>For the LR circuit:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Larger inductance = slower discharge</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Larger resistance = faster discharge</p>
<p>Students usually want to just use the <span class="math"><em>τ</em> = <em>R</em><em>C</em></span> and <span class="math">$\tau = {L \over R}$</span> formulae to answer questions like this, but unfortunately this does not lend itself to a firm conceptual understanding of time-constant circuit behavior.</p>
<p>If students need hints on how to answer the capacitance and inductance questions, ask them what the fundamental definitions of &quot;capacitance&quot; and &quot;inductance&quot; are (the ability to store energy . . .). Then ask them what takes longer to discharge (given the same power, or rate of energy release per unit time), a large reservoir of energy or a small reservoir of energy.</p>
<p>If students need hints on how to answer the resistance questions, ask them what each type of reactive component resists change in (voltage for capacitors and current for inductors). Then ask them what condition(s) are necessary to cause the most rapid change in those variables (high current for capacitors and high voltage for inductors). This is most evident by inspection of the differential equations <span class="math">$i = C{dv \over dt}$</span> and <span class="math">$v = L {di \over dt}$</span>.</p>
