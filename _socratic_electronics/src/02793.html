<p>Use circuit simulation software to verify your predicted and actual truth tables.</p>
<p>It needs to be understood that this is an AND gate only if you consider the &quot;0&quot; and &quot;1&quot; states as defined by voltage levels with respect to ground, and not by switch actuation. Many students assume an actuated (pushed) switch is a &quot;1&quot; input and a de-actuated (unpushed) switch is a &quot;0&quot; input. Not necessarily so! In this circuit, the switches are connecting inputs to <em>ground</em>. This means a closed (actuated) switch provides a low (0) input state, while an open (unactuated) switch provides a high (1) input state.</p>
