<p>An inductive AC load draws 13.4 amps of current at a voltage of 208 volts. The phase shift between line voltage and line current is measured with an oscilloscope, and determined to be 23<span class="math">$^{o}$</span>. Calculate the following:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Apparent power (<span class="math"><em>S</em></span>) =</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> True power (<span class="math"><em>P</em></span>) =</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Reactive power (<span class="math"><em>Q</em></span>) =</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Power factor =</p>
<p>An electrician suggests to you that the lagging power factor may be corrected by connecting a capacitor in parallel with this load. If the capacitor is sized just right, it will exactly offset the reactive power of the inductive load, resulting in zero total reactive power and a power factor of unity (1). Calculate the size of the necessary capacitor in Farads, assuming a line frequency of 60 Hz.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Apparent power (<span class="math"><em>S</em></span>) = 2.787 kVA</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> True power (<span class="math"><em>P</em></span>) = 2.567 kW</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Reactive power (<span class="math"><em>Q</em></span>) = 1.089 kVAR</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Power factor = 0.921</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Correction capacitor value = 66.77 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>F</p>
<p>Challenge question: write an equation solving for the power factor correction capacitor size (in Farads) given any or all of the variables provided in the question (<span class="math"><em>S</em></span>, <span class="math"><em>P</em></span>, <span class="math"><em>Q</em></span>, <span class="math"><em>f</em></span>, <span class="math"><em>V</em></span>, P.F.).</p>
<p>There are multiple methods of solution for this problem, so be sure to have your students present their thoughts and strategies during discussion! The formula they write in answer to the challenge question will be nothing more than a formalized version of the solution strategy.</p>
