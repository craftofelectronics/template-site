<p>Calculate the power dissipated by a 25 <span class="math">Ω </span> resistor, when powered by a square-wave with a symmetrical amplitude of 100 volts and a frequency of 2 kHz:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00651x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math"><em>P</em><sub><em>R</em></sub> = </span> 400 watts</p>
<p>To calculate this power figure, students have to determine the RMS value of the square wave. Thankfully, this is not difficult.</p>
