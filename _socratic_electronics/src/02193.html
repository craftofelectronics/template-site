<p>Although most high-power AC loads are inductive in nature, some are capacitive. Explain what you would have to do to correct for the <em>leading</em> power factor of a large capacitive load, provided the power factor were low enough to warrant the expense of equipment to correct it.</p>
<p>If inductive loads have their low power factors corrected by the addition of parallel capacitors, the solution to correcting low power factor for a capacitive load should be easy to identify. Iâ€™ll let you figure out the answer to this!</p>
<p>Challenge question: explain how you could exploit the inductive nature of electric motors and other more common load devices in correcting for an excessively low leading power factor.</p>
<p>If some students fail to understand the answer to this question, try drawing an &quot;upside-down&quot; power triangle to illustrate:</p>
