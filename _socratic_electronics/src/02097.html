<p>Use circuit simulation software to verify your predicted and measured parameter values.</p>
<p>Use a sine-wave function generator for the AC voltage source. Specify a resonant frequency within the audio range.</p>
<p>This exercise assumes access to a variety of capacitor and/or inductor sizes, so the student may make series-parallel networks to achieve the necessary values of <span class="math"><em>L</em></span> and/or <span class="math"><em>C</em></span>. It would be wise for you (the instructor) to check your studentsâ€™ component kits for <span class="math"><em>L</em></span> and <span class="math"><em>C</em></span> values prior to choosing resonant frequencies for them to try to achieve.</p>
<p>I also recommend having students use an oscilloscope to measure AC voltage in a circuit such as this, because some digital multimeters have difficulty accurately measuring AC voltage much beyond line frequency range. I find it particularly helpful to set the oscilloscope to the &quot;X-Y&quot; mode so that it draws a thin line on the screen rather than sweeps across the screen to show an actual waveform. This makes it easier to measure peak-to-peak voltage.</p>
