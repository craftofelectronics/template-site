<p>What may be done if you solder a component into a circuit board and then realize you soldered it in the wrong place? What, exactly, must you do to move this component to a different location on the board?</p>
<p>You must <em>desolder</em> the component from the board, using any number of desoldering tools:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> De-soldering &quot;wick&quot;</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> De-soldering bulb</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> De-soldering &quot;pump&quot;</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Vacuum station</p>
<p>Ask your students to describe how some common desoldering tools (wick, bulb, plunger, vacuum system) work, and also ask them where they obtained their information.</p>
