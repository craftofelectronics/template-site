<p>Most flashlights use multiple 1.5 volt batteries to power a light bulb with a voltage rating of several volts. Draw a schematic diagram of showing how multiple batteries may be connected to achieve a total voltage greater than any one of the batteriesâ€™ individual voltages.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00038x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Follow-up question: if each of these batteries outputs a voltage of 1.5 volts, how much voltage does the light bulb experience?</p>
<p>Ask the students where they would place a switch to control the light bulb in the circuit shown in the answer.</p>
