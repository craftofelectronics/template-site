<p>Suppose someone were to ask you to differentiate electrical reactance (<span class="math"><em>X</em></span>) from electrical resistance (<span class="math"><em>R</em></span>). How would you distinguish these two similar concepts from one another, using your own words?</p>
<p>It is really important for you to frame this concept in your own words, so be sure to check with your instructor on the accuracy of your answer to this question! To give you a place to start, I offer this distinction: resistance is electrical <em>friction</em>, whereas reactance is electrical <em>energy storage</em>. Fundamentally, the difference between <span class="math"><em>X</em></span> and <span class="math"><em>R</em></span> is a matter of energy exchange, and it is understood most accurately in those terms.</p>
<p>This is an excellent point of crossover with your studentsâ€™ studies in elementary physics, if they are studying physics now or have studied physics in the past. The energy-storing actions of inductors and capacitors are quite analogous to the energy-storing actions of masses and springs (respectively, if you associate velocity with current and force with voltage). In the same vein, resistance is analogous to kinetic friction between a moving object and a stationary surface. The parallels are so accurate, in fact, that the electrical properties of <span class="math"><em>R</em></span>, <span class="math"><em>L</em></span>, and <span class="math"><em>C</em></span> have been exploited to model mechanical systems of friction, mass, and resilience in circuits known as <em>analog computers</em>.</p>
