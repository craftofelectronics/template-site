<p>When plotted on a curve tracer, the characteristic curve for a normal PN junction rectifying diode looks something like this:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03128x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Label each axis (horizontal and vertical) of the curve tracer graph, then determine whether the diode behaves more like a voltage source or more like a current source (i.e. does it try to maintain constant voltage or does it try to maintain constant current?) when it is conducting current.</p>
<p>Models are very useful because they simplify circuit approximations. For example, we can analyze this diode circuit quite easily if we substitute an electrical source in place of the diode:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03128x03.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The only question here is, which substitution makes the most sense? Based on the diode’s characteristic curve behavior, should we substitute a voltage source or a current source in place of it? Assuming this is a 1N4001 rectifying diode, what is the value we should use for the substituting source?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03128x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>This behavior is similar to that of a voltage source once it is forward-biased and conducting current.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: quite obviously, diodes do not behave exactly as voltage sources. You cannot power anything off of a diode, for instance! Identify some of the limitations inherent to modeling diodes as voltage sources. Are there any instances you can think of where such a model could be misleading?</p>
<p>Modeling nonlinear semiconductor components in terms of linear, idealized passive components is a time-honored &quot;trick&quot; used to simplify circuit analysis. Like all &quot;tricks&quot; and analogies, this one has definite limitations. The follow-up question’s hint practically gives away examples of where such a model could be misleading!</p>
