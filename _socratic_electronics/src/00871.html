<p>At the heart of every amplifier is a device that uses one signal to control another. In electronics, this means a device that uses a small voltage or current signal to control a larger voltage or current.</p>
<p>The first electronic amplifying circuits were constructed with devices called <em>electron tubes</em> instead of <em>transistors</em>. Tubes still find specialized applications in electronics, but they have largely been replaced by transistors. Why is this? What advantages do transistors have over tubes as amplifying devices?</p>
<p>Transistors are typically much more physically rugged than electron tubes, able to withstand greater levels of vibration and stress. They are also smaller, and more energy efficient in most applications.</p>
<p>Electron tubes used to be the &quot;workhorses&quot; of the electronics world, acting as power control and amplification devices for a wide range of applications. It should be interesting to listen to your studentsâ€™ feedback on this question, being that there is a lot of &quot;tube&quot; information on the internet. <em>IEEE Spectrum</em> magazine had a couple of excellent articles on electron tubes and their applications, which I would strongly encourage any interested students to read.</p>
