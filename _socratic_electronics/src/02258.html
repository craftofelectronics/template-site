<p>Ideally, a sinusoidal oscillator will output a signal consisting of a single (fundamental) frequency, with no harmonics. Realistically, though, sine-wave oscillators always exhibit some degree of distortion, and are therefore never completely harmonic-free.</p>
<p>Describe what the display of a spectrum analyzer would look like when connected to the output of a <em>perfect</em> sinusoidal oscillator. Then, describe what the same instrument’s display would look like if the oscillator exhibited substantial distortion.</p>
<p>I’ll let you figure out the answer to this question on your own.</p>
<p>The purpose of this question is to get students to think about how a spectrum analyzer would be used in a practical scenario, and what the spectrum would look like for a couple of different scenarios. Really, it focuses more on the harmonic analysis instrument (the spectrum analyzer) more than the oscillator circuit.</p>
