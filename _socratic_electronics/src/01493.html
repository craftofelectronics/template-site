<p>Modify your telegraph station design to incorporate <em>two</em> indicator lights: one for transmission and one for reception. How could the stations circuitry be changed such that there would be separate lights to indicate different directions of data travel?</p>
<p>Challenge: modify the circuit so that the &quot;sending&quot; light only illuminates if the other station’s &quot;receive&quot; light actually has a complete circuit. In other words, if the receiving station’s &quot;receive&quot; light fails open and does not light, the transmitting station’s &quot;send&quot; light should not light either!</p>
<p>There are several ways to accomplish this design change. Remember that you are not limited to using just the components shown in the example diagram. You could, for example, use a different kind of switch at each station.</p>
<p>It should be interesting to see all the different ideas your students come up with as they attempt to answer this design challenge. Be sure that your students have opportunities to share their ideas with the class at large, for maximum learning.</p>
