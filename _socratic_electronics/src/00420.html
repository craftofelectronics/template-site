<p>Suppose the electrical power supplied to a commercial building is labeled as &quot;208/120 volt&quot;. What does this label mean, exactly? Relate this description to a schematic diagram.</p>

<p>Many students are confused by this when seeing it for the first time. How is it possible to measure voltage between two points in a circuit and obtain 208 volts, when the two series-connected voltage sources between those two points are 120 volts each? Why isnâ€™t it 240/120 volts instead?</p>
<p>The answer to this question, of course, is <em>phase shift</em>: the answer to most &quot;strange&quot; phenomenon in AC circuits!</p>
