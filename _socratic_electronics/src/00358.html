<p>What will happen to the voltages across resistors R1 and R2 when the load is connected to the divider circuit?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00358x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>When the load is connected across R2, R2’s voltage will &quot;sag&quot; (decrease) while R1’s voltage will rise (increase).</p>
<p>This is a very important concept to be learned about voltage divider circuits: how they respond to applications of load. Not a single calculation need be done to arrive at the answer for this question, so encourage your students to think <em>qualitatively</em> rather than <em>quantitatively</em>. Too many students have the habit of reaching for their calculators when faced with a problem like this, when they really just need to apply more thought.</p>
