<p>Suppose you wished to build a component with no other purpose than to provide inductance in an electric circuit (an <em>inductor</em>). How might you design such a device to perform this function, and how could you maximize its inductance?</p>
<p>I’ll let you determine how an inductor is constructed, from your own research.</p>
<p>To increase inductance:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Increase number of &quot;turns&quot; in coil</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Increase diameter of coil</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Decrease length of coil</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Increase permeability of core material</p>
<p>These factors are important to understand for comprehending the function of variable inductors. Be sure to bring up the subject of variable inductors in your discussion with students.</p>
