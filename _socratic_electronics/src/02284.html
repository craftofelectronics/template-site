<p>A circuit often used to amplitude-modulate a carrier signal is a <em>multiplier</em>:</p>

<p>Explain how the instantaneous multiplication of two sine waves results in amplitude modulation. If possible, graph this on a graphing calculator or other computer plotting device.</p>
<p>Iâ€™ll let you figure this one out on your own!</p>
<p>Multiplier circuits are quite useful, and not just for amplitude modulation. The fact that they can be used as amplitude modulators, though, is a concept some students find hard to understand. One illustration that might clear things up is an adjustable voltage divider (since multiplication and division are very closely related):</p>

<p>Now, such a potentiometer circuit would be totally impractical for any modulating signal frequency measured in Hertz, as the potentiometer would wear out very rapidly from all the motion. It is the <em>principle</em> of modulated voltage division that this circuit helps to communicate, though. Multiplier circuits do the same thing, only multiplying the amplitude of the carrier signal rather than dividing it.</p>
