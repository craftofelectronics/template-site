<p>Calculate the power supply frequency at which the reactances of a 33 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>F and a 75 mH inductor are exactly equal to each other. Derive a mathematical equation from the individual reactance equations (<span class="math"><em>X</em><sub><em>L</em></sub> = 2<em>π</em><em>f</em><em>L</em></span> and <span class="math">$X_C = {1 \over {2 \pi f C}}$</span>), solving for frequency (<span class="math"><em>f</em></span>) in terms of <span class="math"><em>L</em></span> and <span class="math"><em>C</em></span> in this condition.</p>
<p>Calculate the total impedance of these two components, if they were connected in series, at that frequency.</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>f</em><sub><em>r</em><em>e</em><em>s</em><em>o</em><em>n</em><em>a</em><em>n</em><em>t</em></sub> = </span> 101.17 Hz. At this frequency, <span class="math"><em>Z</em><sub><em>s</em><em>e</em><em>r</em><em>i</em><em>e</em><em>s</em></sub> = </span> 0 <span class="math">Ω </span>.</p>
<p>The answer gives away the meaning of this question: the determination of an LC circuit’s <em>resonant</em> frequency. Students may be surprised at the total impedance figure of 0 <span class="math">Ω </span>, but this is really nothing more than an extension of the &quot;impedance cancellation&quot; concept they’ve seen before in other series LC circuit questions. In this case, the cancellation concept has merely been taken to the ultimate level of <em>total</em> cancellation between the two impedances.</p>
