<p>When studying latch circuits, you will come across many references to <em>set</em> and <em>reset</em> logic states. Give a simple definition for each of these terms in the context of latch and flip-flop circuits.</p>
<p>A latch is considered <em>set</em> when its output (<span class="math"><em>Q</em></span>) is high, and <em>reset</em> when its output (<span class="math"><em>Q</em></span>) is low.</p>
<p>Having a consistent definition for &quot;set&quot; and &quot;reset&quot; is important, especially as students study multiple latch circuit topologies and active-low inputs!</p>
