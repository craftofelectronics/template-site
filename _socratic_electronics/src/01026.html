<p>This circuit is a precision full-wave rectifier.</p>
<p>It is much easier to analyze the behavior of this circuit with a positive input voltage than it is to analyze it with a negative input voltage! There is a tendency for students to reach this conclusion when analyzing the circuit’s behavior with a negative input voltage:</p>

<p>The error seems reasonable until an analysis of <em>current</em> is made. If these voltages were true, Kirchhoff’s Current Law would be violated at the first opamp’s virtual ground:</p>
