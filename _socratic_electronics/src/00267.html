<p>Many electronic circuits use what is called a <em>split</em> or a <em>dual</em> power supply:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00267x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Determine what a digital voltmeter would indicate if connected between the following points:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Red lead on &quot;A&quot;, black lead on ground</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Red lead on &quot;B&quot;, black lead on ground</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Red lead on &quot;A&quot;, black lead on &quot;B&quot;</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Red lead on &quot;B&quot;, black lead on &quot;A&quot;</p>
<p>NOTE: <em>in electronic systems, &quot;ground&quot; is often not associated with an actual earth-soil contact. It usually only refers to a common point of reference somewhere in the circuit used to take voltage measurements. This allows us to specify voltages at single points in the circuit, with the implication that &quot;ground&quot; is the point for the voltmeter to connect to.</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Red lead on &quot;A&quot;, black lead on ground (<em>Digital voltmeter reads +15 volts</em>)</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Red lead on &quot;B&quot;, black lead on ground (<em>Digital voltmeter reads -15 volts</em>)</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Red lead on &quot;A&quot;, black lead on &quot;B&quot; (<em>Digital voltmeter reads +30 volts</em>)</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Red lead on &quot;B&quot;, black lead on &quot;A&quot; (<em>Digital voltmeter reads -30 volts</em>)</p>
<p>This question may be easily answered with only a voltmeter, two batteries, and a single &quot;jumper&quot; wire to connect the two batteries in series. It does not matter if the batteries are 15 volts each! The fundamental principle may still be investigated with batteries of any voltage, so this is a very easy demonstration to set up during discussion time.</p>
