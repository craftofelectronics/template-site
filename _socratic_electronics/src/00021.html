<p>The voltmeter will register -6 volts.</p>
<p>What do you suppose will happen if the voltmeter is of the <em>analog</em> style (with a moving &quot;needle&quot; rather than a numerical display)?</p>
<p>Ask the students how an analog (moving pointer) style of voltmeter would respond in this situation. This question lends itself very well to simple experimentation in the classroom, even during discussion time.</p>
