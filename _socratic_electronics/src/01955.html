<p>Small electrical wires are almost always sized by <em>gauge</em> rather than by <em>circular mils</em> (cmils). So, if you had to calculate the resistance of a length of 22-gauge copper wire and did not have the proper tools to measure the wireâ€™s diameter, how could you find the equivalent cross-sectional area in circular mils so as to use the equation <span class="math">$R = {\rho l \over A}$</span>?</p>
<p>This information may be found in a <em>wire gauge table</em>, where gauge numbers and circular mil values are cross-referenced.</p>
<p>Show your students a wire gauge table, if their textbooks do not already contain one.</p>
