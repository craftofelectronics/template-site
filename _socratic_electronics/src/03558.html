<p>Calculate the rate of change of voltage (<span class="math">$dv \over dt$</span>) for the capacitor at the exact instant in time where the switch moves to the &quot;charge&quot; position. Assume that prior to this motion the switch had been left in the &quot;discharge&quot; position for some time:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03558x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math">$dv \over dt$</span> = 4.44 kV/s or 4.44 V/ms</p>
<p>Some students may think that a rate of change of 4.44 <em>kilo</em>volts per second harbors shock hazard, because, well, 4.44 <em>thousand</em> volts is a lot of voltage! Remind them that this is a <em>rate of change</em> and not an actual voltage figure. This number simply tells us how fast the voltage is changing, not how far it will rise to. It is the difference between saying that a car travels at 75 miles per hour and that a car will travel 75 miles.</p>
