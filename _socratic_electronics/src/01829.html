<p>One way to vary the amount of power delivered to a resistive AC load is by varying another resistance connected in series:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01829x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>A problem with this power control strategy is that power is wasted in the series resistance (<span class="math"><em>I</em><sup>2</sup><em>R</em><sub><em>s</em><em>e</em><em>r</em><em>i</em><em>e</em><em>s</em></sub></span>). A different strategy for controlling power is shown here, using a series <em>inductance</em> rather than resistance:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01829x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Explain why the latter circuit is more power-efficient than the former, and draw a phasor diagram showing how changes in <span class="math"><em>L</em><sub><em>s</em><em>e</em><em>r</em><em>i</em><em>e</em><em>s</em></sub></span> affect <span class="math"><em>Z</em><sub><em>t</em><em>o</em><em>t</em><em>a</em><em>l</em></sub></span>.</p>
<p>Inductors are <em>reactive</em> rather than <em>resistive</em> components, and therefore do not dissipate power (ideally).</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01829x03.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Follow-up question: the inductive circuit is not just more energy-efficient â€“ it is safer as well. Identify a potential safety hazard that the resistive power-control circuit poses due to the energy dissipation of its variable resistor.</p>
<p>If appropriate, you may want to mention devices called <em>saturable reactors</em>, which are used to control power in AC circuits by the exact same principle: varying a series inductance.</p>
