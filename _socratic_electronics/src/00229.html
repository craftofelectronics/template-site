<p>Suppose there was something wrong in this electrical system. When the shaft of the generator is turned, the light bulb does not light up:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00229x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>What are some of the possible causes of this failure? Please be specific. Also, what could you do to either confirm or deny these specific possibilities?</p>
<p>There may be an &quot;open&quot; fault in the circuit somewhere, and/or the light bulb could be improperly sized for the generator’s rated voltage output. I’ll let you determine how certain diagnostic checks could be made in this system to determine the exact nature of the fault!</p>
<p>This question poses an excellent opportunity to group discussion on troubleshooting theory and technique. There are several different ways in which the nature of the fault may be determined. Encourage your students to think creatively!</p>
