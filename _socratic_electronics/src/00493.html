<p>If we were to express the series-connected DC voltages as <em>phasors</em> (arrows pointing with a particular length and a particular direction, graphically expressing magnitude and polarity of an electrical signal), how would we draw them in such a way that the total (or <em>resultant</em>) phasors accurately expressed the total voltage of each series-connected pair?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00493x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>If we were to assign angle values to each of these phasors, what would you suggest?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00493x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>In the right-hand circuit, where the two voltage sources are opposing, one of the phasors will have an angle of 0<span class="math">$^{o}$</span>, while the other will have an angle of 180<span class="math">$^{o}$</span>.</p>
<p>Phasors are really nothing more than an extension of the familiar &quot;number line&quot; most students see during their primary education years. The important difference here is that phasors are two-dimensional magnitudes, not one-dimensional, as <em>scalar</em> numbers are.</p>
<p>The use of degrees to measure angles should be familiar as well, even to those students without a strong mathematics background. For example, what does it mean when a skateboarder or stunt bicyclist &quot;does a <em>180</em>&quot;? It means they turn around so as to face the opposite direction (180 degrees away from) their previous direction.</p>
