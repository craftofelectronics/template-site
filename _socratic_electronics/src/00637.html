<p>In this circuit, a series resistor-capacitor network creates a phase-shifted voltage for the &quot;gate&quot; terminal of a power-control device known as a <em>TRIAC</em>. All portions of the circuit except for the RC network are &quot;shaded&quot; for de-emphasis:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00637x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Calculate how many degrees of phase shift the capacitorâ€™s voltage is, compared to the total voltage across the series RC network, assuming a frequency of 60 Hz, and a 50% potentiometer setting.</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>E</em><sub><em>C</em></sub></span> phase shift = -76.7<span class="math">$^{o}$</span></p>
<p>Challenge question: what effect will a change in potentiometer setting have on this phase angle? Specifically, will increasing the resistance make the phase shift approach -90<span class="math">$^{o}$</span> or approach 0<span class="math">$^{o}$</span>?</p>
<p>In this question, I purposely omitted any reference to voltage levels, so the students would have to set up part of the problem themselves. The goal here is to build problem-solving skills.</p>
