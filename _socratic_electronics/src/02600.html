<p>Some operational amplifiers are <em>internally compensated</em>, while others are <em>externally compensated</em>. Explain the difference between the two. Hint: examples of each include the classic LM741 and LM101 operational amplifiers. Research their respective datasheets to see what you find on compensation!</p>
<p>The difference is the physical location of the compensating capacitor, whether it is a part of the integrated circuit or external to it.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: show how an external compensating capacitor may be connected to an opamp such as the LM101.</p>
<p>Ask your students to explain why we might wish to use either type of opamp when building a circuit. In what applications do they think an internally-compensated opamp would be better, and in what applications do they think an externally-compensated opamp would be preferable?</p>
