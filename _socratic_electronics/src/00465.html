<p>There are two wire windings wrapped around a common iron bar in this illustration, such that whatever magnetic flux may be produced by one winding is fully shared by the other winding:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00465x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Write two equations describing the induced voltage at each winding (<span class="math"><em>e</em><sub><em>p</em></sub> = …</span> and <span class="math"><em>e</em><sub><em>s</em></sub> = …</span>), in each case expressing the induced voltage in terms of the instantaneous current through that winding (<span class="math"><em>i</em><sub><em>p</em></sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>i</em><sub><em>s</em></sub></span>, respectively) and the inductance of each winding (<span class="math"><em>L</em><sub><em>p</em></sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>L</em><sub><em>s</em></sub></span>, respectively).</p>
<p>We know that the induced voltages in the two windings are related to each other by this equation, if there is perfect &quot;coupling&quot; of magnetic flux between the two windings:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">${e_p \over N_p} = {e_s \over N_s}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Knowing this, write two more equations describing induced voltage, this time expressing the induced voltage in each winding in terms of the instantaneous current in the <em>other</em> winding. In other words,</p>
<p><br /><span class="math"><em>e</em><sub><em>p</em></sub> = …<em>i</em><sub><em>s</em></sub></span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math"><em>e</em><sub><em>s</em></sub> = …<em>i</em><sub><em>p</em></sub></span><br /></p>
<p>Equations describing self-inductance:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$e_p = L_p{di_p \over dt}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$e_s = L_s{di_s \over dt}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Equations describing inductance from one winding to the other:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$e_p = L_s {N_p \over N_s} {di_s \over dt}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$e_s = L_p {N_s \over N_p} {di_p \over dt}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The first two equations are mere review. The second two equations require algebraic manipulation and substitution between equations.</p>
