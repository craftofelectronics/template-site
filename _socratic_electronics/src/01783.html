<p>Size all three resistors in this voltage divider circuit to provide the necessary voltages to the loads, given the load voltage and current specifications shown:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01783x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Assume a bleed current of 1.5 mA. As part of your design, include the power dissipation ratings of all resistors.</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub> = 545. 5 Ω </span>, rated for at least 148.5 mW dissipation (<span class="math">$1 \over 4$</span> watt recommended).</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub> = 933. 3 Ω </span>, <span class="math">$1 \over 8$</span> watt power dissipation is more than adequate.</p>
<p><span class="math">$R_3 = 3.2 \hbox{ k} \Omega$</span>, <span class="math">$1 \over 8$</span> watt power dissipation is more than adequate.</p>
<p>Nothing special to comment on here, just a straightforward voltage divider design problem.</p>
