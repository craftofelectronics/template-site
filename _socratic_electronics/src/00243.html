<p>Connect the windings of this step-down transformer so that it &quot;bucks&quot; the voltage going to the light bulb by 12 volts:</p>

<p>Phase markings (the dots near the end of each winding) are very important when deciding which way to connect transformer windings! Some students may find it helpful to use DC polarity markings (+ and -) in addition to dots, to determine whether voltages will be in-phase (boosting) or out-of-phase (bucking).</p>
