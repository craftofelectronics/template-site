<p>An Exclusive-OR gate has the following Boolean expression:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$A\overline{B} + \overline{A}B$</span><br /></p>
<p>Draw the schematic diagram for a gate circuit exhibiting this Boolean function, constructed entirely from NAND gates.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02816x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>An interesting feature of this circuit is the final three NAND gates: two NAND gates feeding into a third NAND gate is equivalent to two AND gates feeding into an OR gate, thanks to DeMorganâ€™s Theorem!</p>
