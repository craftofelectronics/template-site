<p>If you have ever heard the sound of a dual-engine airplane flying overhead, you probably noticed an unusual &quot;beat&quot; pattern to the enginesâ€™ tone. The same phenomenon happens when you play the output of two audio signal generators through speakers, with the signal generators set to very similar (but not identical!) frequencies:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01141x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Explain how this phenomenon could be used by a technician to adjust two audio frequency sources to the same frequency, without the aid of any expensive test equipment such as a frequency counter or an oscilloscope.</p>
<p>Adjust the frequency of one of the sources until no &quot;beating&quot; sound is heard anymore between the two audio tones.</p>
<p>This is a very simple experiment to set up in the classroom, but beware! I once had two audio signal generators creating low-frequency sine-wave tones for my students, shortly after their lunch break. With full stomachs, a couple of my students had a very difficult time remaining awake while listening to the low tones.</p>
