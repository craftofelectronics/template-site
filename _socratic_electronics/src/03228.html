<p>Examine this circuit, consisting of an ideal voltage source and several resistors:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03228x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>First, calculate the voltage seen at the load terminals with a voltmeter directly connected across them (an <em>open-circuit</em> condition):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03228x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Next, calculate the current seen at the load terminals with an ammeter directly connected across them (a <em>short-circuit</em> condition):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03228x03.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Based on these open- and short-circuit calculations, draw a new circuit consisting of a single voltage source and a single (series) resistor that will respond in the exact same manner. In other words, design an <em>equivalent circuit</em> for the circuit shown here, using the minimum number of possible components.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03228x04.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Follow-up question: is this circuit truly equivalent to the original shown in the question? Sure, it responds the same under extreme conditions (open-circuit and short-circuit), but will it respond the same as the original circuit under modest load conditions (say, with a 5 k<span class="math">Ω </span> resistor connected across the load terminals)?</p>
<p>The purpose of this question is to get students thinking about Thévenin equivalent circuits from the perspective of how the original circuit responds to extreme variations in load resistance.</p>
<p>This question is also a good review of voltmeter and ammeter behavior: that ideal voltmeters act as open circuits (infinite input resistance) while ideal ammeters act as short circuits (zero input impedance).</p>
