<p>Two’s complement notation really shows its value in binary addition, where positive and negative quantities may be handled with equal ease. Add the following byte-long (8 bit) two’s complement numbers together, and then convert all binary quantities into decimal form to verify the accuracy of the addition:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01227x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01227x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Have your students do some of these problems on the board, in front of class for all to see. Ask students what happens to the left-most &quot;carry&quot; bit, if it exists in any of these problems. Ask them <em>why</em> we do what we do with that bit, when we would usually place it in our answer.</p>
