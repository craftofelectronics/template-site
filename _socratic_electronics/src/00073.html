<p>Identify several substances that are good conductors of electricity, and several substances that are good insulators of electricity.</p>
<p>It is very easy to research (and test!) whether or not various substances are either conductors or insulators of electricity. I leave this task in your very capable hands.</p>
<p>If students have access to simple multimeters, they may perform conductivity tests on various substances with them. This is a fun and interesting classroom activity!</p>
