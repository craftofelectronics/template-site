<p>Determine the amount of time needed after switch closure for the capacitor voltage (<span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>C</em></sub></span>) to reach the specified levels:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03118x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math"></span><br /><span class="math">$Trace the direction of current in the circuit while the capacitor is charging, and be sure to denote whether you are using electron or conventional flow notation.

\vskip 10pt

Note: the voltages are specified as negative quantities because they are negative with respect to (positive) ground in this particular circuit.

\underbar{file 03118}$</span><br /><span class="math"></span> While the capacitor is charging, electron flow moves clockwise and conventional flow moves counter-clockwise.</p>
<p>Ask your students to show how they algebraically solved the standard time constant equation for <span class="math"><em>t</em></span> using logarithms.</p>
