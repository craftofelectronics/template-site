<p>When an electric current passes through a conductor offering some electrical resistance, the temperature of that conductor increases above ambient. Why is this? Of what practical importance is this effect?</p>
<p>Electrical resistance is analogous to mechanical <em>friction</em>: electrons cannot freely flow through a resistance, and the &quot;friction&quot; they encounter translates some of their energy into heat, just as the friction in a worn mechanical bearing translates some of the kinetic energy of it’s rotation into heat, or the friction between a person’s hands while rubbing them together on a cold day translates some of the motion into heat.</p>
<p>This is a good starting point for a discussion on work, energy, and power. Power, of course, may be directly calculated by multiplying voltage by current, and is measured in <em>watts</em>. It also provides an opportunity to discuss some of the practical limitations of electrical conductors.</p>
