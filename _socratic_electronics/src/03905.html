<p>This shift register circuit drives the four coils of a unipolar stepper motor, one at a time, in a rotating pattern that moves at the pace of the clock. The drive transistor circuitry (<span class="math"><em>Q</em><sub>1</sub></span>, <span class="math"><em>Q</em><sub>2</sub></span>, and resistors <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span> through <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>6</sub></span>) are shown only for one of the four coils. The other three shift register outputs have identical drive circuits connected to the respective motor coils:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03905x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Suppose this stepper motor circuit worked just fine for several years, then suddenly stopped working. Explain where you would take your first few measurements to isolate the problem, and why you would measure there.</p>
<p>My first step would be to check for the presence of adequate DC power to both the shift register IC and the motor (transistor drive circuitry). Then, I would use a voltmeter or logic probe to check for pulsing at any one of the shift registerâ€™s <span class="math"><em>Q</em></span> outputs. That would tell me whether the problem was with the shift register or with the power circuitry.</p>
<p>This is a good question to discuss with your students, as it helps them understand how to &quot;divide and conquer&quot; a malfunctioning system.</p>
