<p>Manipulate each of these equations to solve for <span class="math"><em>a</em></span>:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">${{b - a} \over c} = d \hbox{\hskip 140pt} \sqrt{a + b} = c^2 d$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$a = b - cd \hbox{\hskip 140pt} a = c^4 d^2 - b$</span><br /></p>
<p>Have your students come to the front of the class and show everyone else the techniques they used to solve for <span class="math"><em>a</em></span> in each equation. Remind them to document each and every step in the process, so that nothing is left to guess or to chance.</p>
