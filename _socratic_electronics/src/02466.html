<p>Use circuit simulation software to verify your predicted and measured parameter values.</p>
<p>Use a dual-voltage, regulated power supply to supply power to the opamp. Specify all four resistors as equal value, between 1 k<span class="math">Ω </span> and 100 k<span class="math">Ω </span> (1k5, 2k2, 2k7, 3k3, 4k7, 5k1, 6k8, 10k, 22k, 33k, 39k 47k, 68k, etc.). This will ensure a differential voltage gain of unity. If you <em>want</em> to have a different voltage gain, then by all means specify these resistor values however you see fit!</p>
<p>Differential gain is calculated by averaging the quotients of each measured <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>o</em><em>u</em><em>t</em></sub></span> value with its respective <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>i</em><em>n</em>( + )</sub> − <em>V</em><sub><em>i</em><em>n</em>( − )</sub></span> differential input voltage. Common-mode gain is calculated by dividing the difference in output voltages (<span class="math">Δ <em>V</em><sub><em>o</em><em>u</em><em>t</em></sub></span>) by the difference in common-mode input voltages (<span class="math">Δ <em>V</em><sub><em>i</em><em>n</em></sub></span>).</p>
<p>An extension of this exercise is to incorporate troubleshooting questions. Whether using this exercise as a performance assessment or simply as a concept-building lab, you might want to follow up your students’ results by asking them to predict the consequences of certain circuit faults.</p>
