<p>Calculate the current in this circuit, and also the amount of mechanical power (in units of &quot;horsepower&quot;) required to turn this alternator (assume 100% efficiency):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00768x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math"><em>I</em></span> = 141.18 A</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>P</em></span> = 0 horsepower, so long as the inductor is &quot;pure&quot; (100 percent inductance, with no resistance).</p>
<p>The answer to this question will surprise many of your students, because they are accustomed to calculating power simply by multiplying voltage by current (<span class="math"><em>P</em> = <em>I</em><em>E</em></span>).</p>
<p>Ask your students how they calculated line current in this circuit, and then challenge them with the question of how 0 watts of power can be dissipated in this circuit with all this current and all this voltage (480 volts).</p>
