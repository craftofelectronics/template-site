<p>In this system, the voltage output of a digital timing circuit controls the charging and discharging of a resistor-capacitor network. The inner workings of the digital timing circuit are hidden for simplicityâ€™s sake, but we may model it as a two-position switch, outputting either a &quot;high&quot; voltage signal (full supply voltage) or a &quot;low&quot; voltage signal (ground potential) at regular intervals:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02419x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>First, identify what signal level from the digital circuit (&quot;high&quot; or &quot;low&quot;) causes the capacitor to charge, and what level causes it to discharge. Then, replace the BJT with a suitable MOSFET to accomplish the exact same timing function:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02419x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>In the BJT version of the circuit, a &quot;low&quot; signal output by the digital circuit causes the capacitor to charge. The same thing happens in this MOSFET version of the circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02419x03.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Follow-up question: explain why no resistor is required in series with the MOSFET gate as there was with the BJT base in the original circuit version.</p>
<p>This circuit could be used as an introduction to the 555 timer, since that IC uses the same scheme for capacitor discharge.</p>
