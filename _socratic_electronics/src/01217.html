<p>Calculate the ideal amount of load impedance for this amplifier circuit, so that maximum power will be delivered to it:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01217x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>l</em><em>o</em><em>a</em><em>d</em></sub> = 33</span> <span class="math">Ω </span> (approximate)</p>
<p>Ask your students to explain the mathematics behind this answer. What procedure gives them the quantity of 33 <span class="math">Ω </span> from the given component values? Why is this answer only approximate? What factors might affect it?</p>
<p>Also, ask your students to explain why the common-collector transistor stage does not require a biasing network or coupling capacitor, as the common-emitter stage does.</p>
