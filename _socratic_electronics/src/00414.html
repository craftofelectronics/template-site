<p>A balanced, three-phase power system has a line voltage of 13.8 kV volts and a line current of 150 amps. How much power is being delivered to the load (assuming a power factor of 1)?</p>

<p>A 13.8 kV single-phase system could be designed to provide the same amount of power to a load, but it would require heavier-gauge (more expensive!) conductors. Determine the extra percentage of expense in wire cost (based on the weight of the wires) resulting from the use of single-phase instead of three-phase.</p>

<p><span class="math"><em>P</em><sub><em>l</em><em>o</em><em>a</em><em>d</em></sub> = </span> 3.59 MW</p>
<p>A single-phase system operating at 13.8 kV would require at least 1/0 (&quot;one-ought&quot;) gauge copper conductors to transmit 3.59 MW of power. A three-phase system operating at the same voltage would require at least #2 gauge copper conductors.</p>
<p>This question is good for provoking discussion on the practical, cost-saving benefits of three-phase power systems over single-phase. Your students will have to do some &quot;review&quot; research on wire gauges and weights, but the exercise is well worth it.</p>
