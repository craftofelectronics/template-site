<p>Give a step-by-step procedure for &quot;Thévenizing&quot; <em>any</em> circuit: finding the Thévenin equivalent voltage (<span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>T</em><em>h</em><em>e</em><em>v</em><em>e</em><em>n</em><em>i</em><em>n</em></sub></span>) and Thévenin equivalent resistance (<span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>T</em><em>h</em><em>e</em><em>v</em><em>e</em><em>n</em><em>i</em><em>n</em></sub></span>).</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Step #1:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Step #2:</p>
<p>This is easy enough for you to look up in any electronics textbook. I’ll leave you to it!</p>
<p>Follow-up question: describe the difference in how one must consider <em>voltage sources</em> versus <em>current sources</em> when calculating the equivalent circuit’s resistance (<span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>T</em><em>h</em><em>e</em><em>v</em><em>e</em><em>n</em><em>i</em><em>n</em></sub></span>) of a complex circuit containing both types of sources?</p>
<p>I really mean what I say here about looking this up in a textbook. Thévenin’s Theorem is a very well-covered subject in many books, and so it is perfectly reasonable to expect students will do this research on their own and come back to class with a complete answer.</p>
<p>The follow-up question is very important, because some circuits (especially transistor amplifier circuits) contain <em>both</em> types of sources. Knowing how to consider each one in the process of calculating the Thévenin equivalent resistance for a circuit is very important. When performing this analysis on transistor amplifiers, the circuit often becomes much simpler than its original form with all the voltage sources shorted and current sources opened!</p>
