<p>What type of electronic component do these symbols represent, and what special function does it perform?</p>

<p>These are <em>varistors</em>. Sometimes they are referred to by the acronym <em>MOV</em>, which stands for Metal Oxide Varistor. Iâ€™ll let you research what is unique about the behavior of these devices.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: plot an approximate graph of current versus voltage for a varistor, and comment on how this compares to the current/voltage characteristic of a normal resistor.</p>
<p>Ask your students to reveal their information sources used when researching varistors, and also if they were able to determine how these devices are constructed.</p>
