<p>Explain what a <em>TRIAC</em> is, and how it is at once similar and different from an SCR. What applications might a TRIAC be used in that an SCR would be inappropriate for?</p>
<p>A &quot;TRIAC&quot; functions as two reverse-parallel-connected SCR units, so as to be able to control AC and not just DC.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: draw the equivalent circuit for a TRIAC.</p>
<p>A popular application for TRIACs is lamp dimmer controls, for line-powered (50 or 60 Hz) incandescent lamps. If time permits, discuss with your students how these lamp dimmer circuits control power to the lamp in a manner reminiscent of PWM (Pulse-Width Modulation).</p>
