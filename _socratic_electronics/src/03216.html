<p>Explain what <em>slip speed</em> is for an AC induction motor, and why there must be such as thing as &quot;slip&quot; in order for an induction motor to generate torque.</p>
<p>The difference between the speed of the rotating magnetic field (fixed by line power frequency) and the speed of the rotor is called &quot;slip speed&quot;. Some amount of slip is necessary to generate torque because without it there would be no change in magnetic flux (<span class="math">$d\phi \over dt$</span>) seen by the rotor, and thus no induced currents in the rotor.</p>
<p>It is easy enough for students to research &quot;slip speed&quot; in any motor reference book and present a definition. It is quite another for them to explain <em>why</em> slip is necessary. Be sure to allow ample time in class to discuss this concept, because it is at the heart of induction motor operation.</p>
