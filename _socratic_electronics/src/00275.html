<p>Describe the difference between <em>solid</em> and <em>stranded</em> wire types.</p>
<p>&quot;Solid&quot; wire is formed from a single strand of metal. &quot;Stranded&quot; wire is formed from multiple strands, wound together.</p>
<p>A good follow-up question to this would be to ask, &quot;What are some of the advantages and disadvantages of solid versus stranded wire?&quot; Challenge your students to consider such issues as cost, physical flexibility, and ease of connections.</p>
