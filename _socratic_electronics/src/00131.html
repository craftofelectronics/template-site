<p>Given the following test circuit, with an oscilloscope used to record <em>current</em> from the battery to the cable (measuring voltage dropped across a shunt resistor), what sort of waveform or pulse would the oscilloscope register after switch closure?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00131x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The oscilloscope would register a continuous current of 480 mA any time the switch is closed.</p>
<p>Challenge your students to think of another electrical component (besides an RG-58/U cable of infinite length) that would behave like this, drawing 480 mA of current from a 24 volt source any time the switch is closed. Hint: you donâ€™t have to think very hard!</p>
