<p>It is possible to purchase <em>oven-stabilized</em> zener ICs (integrated circuits). Explain what these are, and what they are useful for.</p>
<p>Oven-stabilized zeners are used for precision voltage references. Iâ€™ll let you research how they are constructed and how they function.</p>
<p>Challenge your students to show you a datasheet for one of these devices!</p>
