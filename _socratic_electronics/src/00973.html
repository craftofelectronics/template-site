<p>Two methods of biasing push-pull transistor pairs are shown here:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00973x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Which of these two methods is preferred, and why?</p>
<p>Biasing with diodes is preferred, because the bias voltage remains stable despite fluctuations in power supply rail voltages.</p>
<p>Ask your students what is special about a <em>diode</em> that provides just the right amount of bias voltage for the transistors.</p>
