<p>A &quot;buck&quot; switching converter operating at 85% efficiency delivers 10 amps of current at 5 volts to a DC load. Calculate the input current if the input voltage is 23 volts.</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>I</em><sub><em>i</em><em>n</em><em>p</em><em>u</em><em>t</em></sub></span> = 2.56 amps</p>
<p>Calculations involving energy efficiency seem very confusing to some students. One principle that I often remind my students of is the Law of Energy Conservation, which prohibits any circuit from outputting more energy (or power) than it takes in. All too often, students mis-calculate in problems such as these, ending up with output powers greater than input powers!</p>
<p>Discuss problem-solving techniques, soliciting input from your students. Ideally, have individuals or groups present their techniques to the class as a whole, so you may observe their thinking processes and so that other students may learn how to become better problem-solvers.</p>
