<p>How hot can the temperature of an arc flash become?</p>
<p>Upwards of 20,000 degrees Kelvin (I’ll leave it to you to convert this into degrees Celsius or Fahrenheit).</p>
<p>Note to your students that this temperature is roughly four times that of the Sun’s surface!!! Very, very, hot an arc flash is! In fact, no materials known are able to withstand such extreme temperatures without becoming <em>vaporized</em>. It takes little imagination to realize what an arc flash can do to human skin.</p>
