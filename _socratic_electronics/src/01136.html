<p><em>Inductance</em> is a very important property in many types of electric circuits. Define what &quot;inductance&quot; is, and what causes it.</p>
<p>&quot;Inductance&quot; is the capacity of a conductor to store energy in the form of a magnetic field, resulting from an applied current. You may also find a definition of &quot;inductance&quot; stated in terms of opposition to change in applied current over time.</p>
<p>Inductance is caused by the establishment of a magnetic field around a conductor.</p>
<p>Ask students what unit of measurement inductance is expressed in. Also, ask them if they think the inductance of any given conductor changes with the applied current or stored energy, or if inductance is a quantity independent of particular electrical conditions.</p>
