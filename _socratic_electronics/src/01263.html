<p>In TTL circuitry, one side of the DC power supply is usually labeled as &quot;<span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>C</em><em>C</em></sub></span>&quot;, while the other side is labeled as &quot;<span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>E</em><em>E</em></sub></span>&quot;. Why is this? What do the subscripts &quot;CC&quot; and &quot;EE&quot; represent?</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>C</em><em>C</em></sub></span> = Power supplied to collector side of bipolar transistors.</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>E</em><em>E</em></sub></span> = Power supplied to emitter side of bipolar transistors.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: Since TTL circuits use NPN transistors exclusively, what polarities must each of these labels represent?</p>
<p>This question is a good review of bipolar junction transistor theory.</p>
