<p>What does &quot;compensation&quot; mean for an operational amplifier circuit? Note that some op-amps are internally compensated, while others are externally compensated.</p>
<p>&quot;Compensation&quot; refers to the intentional placement of a capacitor in the operational amplifier circuit to provide degenerative (negative) feedback at high frequencies. This is usually done to prevent self-oscillation of the amplifier.</p>
