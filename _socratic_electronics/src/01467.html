<p>Draw the schematic diagram for a five-bit serial-in/serial-out shift register circuit, and be prepared to give a brief explanation of how it functions.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01467x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Follow-up question: if we wished to output data from this shift register circuit in parallel form, where would we make the connections?</p>
<p>One application for a serial-in/serial-out shift register is a precise time delay for serial-stream data.</p>
