<p>Capacitors and inductors alike have the ability to both <em>store</em> and <em>release</em> energy. This makes them more complicated than resistors, which merely dissipate energy. As a consequence, the relationship between direction of current and polarity of voltage is a bit more complex for capacitors and inductors than it is for power sources and resistors:</p>

<p>Draw current arrows and voltage polarity marks (+ and - symbols) next to each of the following components, the left group representing a battery, capacitor, and inductor all acting as <em>energy sources</em> and the right group representing a resistor, capacitor, and inductor all acting as <em>energy loads</em>:</p>

<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03725x03.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Follow-up question: what form does the stored energy take inside each type of reactive component? In other words, <em>how</em> does an inductor store energy, and <em>how</em> does a capacitor store energy?</p>
<p>Although the answer may seem a bit too easy – nay, even obvious – the point here is to get students to correlate the behavior of capacitors and inductors in terms of components they already understand very well. Then, they may correctly associate direction of current with polarity of voltage drop according to the direction of energy flow (source versus load) the reactive component is subjected to.</p>
