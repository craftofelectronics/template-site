<p>Suppose you needed to take 24 volts DC and &quot;step&quot; it down to half that voltage to power a load rated for 12 volts. You could, of course, simply use a dropping resistor to drop the extra 12 volts, or even a potentiometer to divide the 24 volts down to 12 volts. However, a &quot;buck&quot; DC-DC converter circuit might be a better way of reducing 24 volts down to 12 volts, especially if the 24 volt source was a battery with limited life. Explain why this is.</p>
<p>DC-DC converter circuits are able to work kind of like transformers do for AC: stepping voltage one way while stepping current the other. The result is much greater energy efficiency than any resistive &quot;dropping&quot; or &quot;dividing&quot; circuit.</p>
