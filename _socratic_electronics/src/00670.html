<p>Calculate all currents in this autotransformer circuit, assuming perfect (100%) efficiency:</p>

<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00670x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Follow-up question: based on these current figures, what economic advantage does an autotransformer have over a conventional transformer in terms of manufacturing cost?</p>
<p>Discuss with your students the pro’s and con’s of autotransformers over regular transformers. Of course, there is the obvious disadvantage: loss of isolation between primary and secondary circuits. If this is not a problem, though, there are substantial advantages to be realized in using an autotransformer over a conventional transformer.</p>
