<p>When a PCB designer speaks of dimensions in <em>thous</em> or <em>mils</em>, what does he or she mean?</p>
<p>Both a &quot;thou&quot; and a &quot;mil&quot; refer to <em>one-thousandth of an inch</em>.</p>
<p>Be sure to remind your students that the &quot;mil&quot; (which is one &quot;milli-inch&quot;) is <em>not</em> to be confused with a millimeter, which is of course a metric dimension rather than an Imperial dimension.</p>
