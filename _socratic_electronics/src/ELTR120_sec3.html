<p>The relationship between direction of current and polarity of voltage drop is simple and straightforward for resistors, because resistors always dissipate power. That is, a resistor will always act as a load. Things are not so simple for reactive components such as inductors and capacitors, however, because these components <em>store</em> and <em>release</em> energy while (ideally) dissipating none. This means they sometimes act as sources and other times act as loads. Since DC-DC converter circuits exploit the energy storage inherent to inductors and/or capacitors, this becomes a very important concept for students to grasp.</p>
