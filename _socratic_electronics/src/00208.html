<p>Complete this statement by substituting the correct electrical variables (voltage, current, resistance, inductance):</p>
<p>Inductors oppose changes in (<em>fill-in-the-blank</em>), reacting to such changes by producing a (<em>fill-in-the-blank</em>).</p>
<p>Inductors oppose changes in <strong>current</strong>, reacting to such changes by producing a <strong>voltage</strong>.</p>
<p>Emphasize to your students that inductance is an essentially <em>reactive</em> property, opposing change in current over time. It is not steady current that inductors react to, only changing current.</p>
