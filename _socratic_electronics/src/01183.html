<p>Determine whether this amplifier circuit is inverting or noninverting (i.e. the phase shift between input and output waveforms):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01183x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Be sure to explain, step by step, <em>how</em> you were able to determine the phase relationship between input and output in this circuit. Also identify the type of amplifier each transistor represents (common-???).</p>
<p>Noninverting. The JFET is connected as a common-source, while the BJT is connected as a common-emitter.</p>
<p>There are several other questions you could ask about this amplifier circuit. For example:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> How is the Q-point bias established for the JFET?</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> How is the Q-point bias established for the BJT?</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> What purpose does the potentiometer serve?</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Is there another possible location for the potentiometer that would perform the same function?</p>
<p>Note: the schematic diagram for this circuit was derived from one found on page 36 of John Markus’ , first edition. Apparently, the design originated from a Motorola publication on using field effect transistors (&quot;Tips on using FET’s,&quot; HMA-33, 1971).</p>
