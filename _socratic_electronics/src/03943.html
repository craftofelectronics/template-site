<p>This current divider circuit has a problem. The voltage between test points TP2 and TP1 varies with the potentiometer position, but the voltage between test points TP3 and TP1 remains at 0 volts no matter where the potentiometer is set:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03943x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Identify the most likely fault which would account for these measurements.</p>
<p>There is an &quot;open&quot; fault in resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span>, or somewhere in series with <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span> (bad solder connection, open trace, etc.).</p>
<p>Follow-up question: identify which direction of potentiometer shaft motion (clockwise or counter-clockwise) should increase the voltage between test points TP2 and TP1.</p>
<p>Discuss with your students how they determined the identity of the fault. Also, be sure to discuss the follow-up question with them: how to determine the proper direction to turn the potentiometer shaft in order to increase <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>T</em><em>P</em>2 − <em>T</em><em>P</em>1</sub></span>. It is important that your students realize how a 3/4 turn potentiometer works, and what to expect when the shaft is turned.</p>
