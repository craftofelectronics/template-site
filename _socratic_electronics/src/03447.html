<p>Doorbell circuits connect a small lamp in parallel with the doorbell pushbutton so that there is light at the button when it is <em>not</em> being pressed. The lamp’s filament resistance is such that there is not enough current going through it to energize the solenoid coil when lit, which means the doorbell will ring only when the pushbutton switch shorts past the lamp:</p>

<p>Suppose that such a doorbell circuit suddenly stops working one day, and the home owner assumes the power source has quit since the bell will not ring when the button is pressed and the lamp never lights. Although a dead power source is certainly possible, it is not the only possibility. Identify another possible failure in this circuit which would result in no doorbell action (no sound) and no light at the lamp.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Solenoid coil failed open</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Wire broken anywhere in circuit</p>
<p>After discussing alternative possibilities with your students, shift the discussion to one on how <em>likely</em> any of these failures are. For instance, how likely is it that the solenoid coil has developed an &quot;open&quot; fault compared to the likelihood of a regular wire connection going bad in the circuit? How do either of these possibilities compare with the likelihood of the source failing as a result of a tripped circuit breaker or other power outage?</p>
