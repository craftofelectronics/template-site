<p>Use circuit simulation software to verify your predicted and measured parameter values.</p>
<p>This is a very interesting circuit to built and test. You may build one using 1 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>F capacitors, 2.7 k<span class="math">Ω </span> resistors, and a 100 k<span class="math">Ω </span> potentiometer that will successfully operate on 60 Hz power-line excitation. If you prefer to use audio frequency power, try 0.047 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>F capacitors, 1 k<span class="math">Ω </span> resistors, a 100 k<span class="math">Ω </span> potentiometer, and 3.386 kHz for the source frequency.</p>
<p>An interesting thing to note about using line power is that any distortions in the excitation sine-wave will become obvious when the potentiometer wiper is turned toward the differentiating position (where <span class="math">Θ </span> is positive). If listened to with an audio detector, you may even hear the change in timbre while moving the wiper from one extreme to the other. If excited by a &quot;clean&quot; sine-wave, however, no change in timbre should be heard because there are no harmonics present.</p>
