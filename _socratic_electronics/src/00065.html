<p>How might you use a meter (or a conductivity/continuity tester) to determine whether this electrical switch is in the <em>open</em> or <em>closed</em> state?</p>

<p>Most multimeters have a &quot;resistance&quot; measurement range (&quot;Ohms scale&quot;) that may be used to check continuity. Either using a meter or a conductivity/continuity tester, measure between the two screw terminals of this switch: if the resistance is low (good conductivity), then the switch is <em>closed</em>. If the measured resistance is infinite (no conductivity), then the switch is <em>open</em>.</p>
<p>This is another question which lends itself well to experimentation. A vitally important skill for students to develop is how to use their test equipment to diagnose the states of individual components.</p>
<p>An inexpensive source of simple (SPST) switches is a hardware store: use the same type of switch that is used in household light control. These switches are very inexpensive, rugged, and come with heavy-duty screw terminals for wire attachment. When used in small battery-powered projects, they are nearly indestructible!</p>
