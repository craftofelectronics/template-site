<p>A technician is troubleshooting a power supply circuit with no DC output voltage. The output voltage is supposed to be 15 volts DC:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00796x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The technician begins making voltage measurements between some of the test points (TP) on the circuit board. What follows is a sequential record of her measurements:</p>
<p>1. <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>T</em><em>P</em>1 − <em>T</em><em>P</em>2</sub> = </span> 118 volts AC</p>
<p>2. <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>T</em><em>P</em>3 − <em>T</em><em>P</em>2</sub> = </span> 0 volts AC</p>
<p>3. <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>T</em><em>P</em>1 − <em>T</em><em>P</em>3</sub> = </span> 118 volts AC</p>
<p>4. <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>T</em><em>P</em>4 − <em>T</em><em>P</em>5</sub> = </span> 0.5 volts AC</p>
<p>5. <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>T</em><em>P</em>7 − <em>T</em><em>P</em>8</sub> = </span> 1.1 volts DC</p>
<p>6. <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>T</em><em>P</em>9 − <em>T</em><em>P</em>10</sub> = </span> 1.1 volts DC</p>
<p>Based on these measurements, what do you suspect has failed in this supply circuit? Explain your answer. Also, critique this technician’s troubleshooting technique and make your own suggestions for a more efficient pattern of steps.</p>
<p>The transformer has an open winding.</p>
<p>Follow-up question #1: with regard to the troubleshooting technique, this technician seems to have started from one end of the circuit and moved incrementally toward the other, checking voltage at almost every point in between. Can you think of a more efficient strategy than to start at one end and work slowly toward the other?</p>
<p>Challenge question: based on the voltage measurements taken, which do you think is the more likely failure, an open primary winding or an open secondary winding?</p>
<p>Follow-up question #2: how could you test the two windings of the transformer for a possible open fault? In other words, is there another type of measurement that could verify our hypothesis of a failed winding?</p>
<p>Troubleshooting scenarios are always good for stimulating class discussion. Be sure to spend plenty of time in class with your students developing efficient and logical diagnostic procedures, as this will assist them greatly in their careers.</p>
<p>Students may be puzzled by the presence of DC voltage between TP7 and TP8, and also between TP9 and TP10 (1.1 volts), given that there is less than that amount of AC voltage at the rectifier’s input. However, this is a common phenomenon with electrolytic capacitors, to &quot;recover&quot; a small voltage after having been discharged.</p>
