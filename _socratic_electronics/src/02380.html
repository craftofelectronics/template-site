<p>Something has failed in the following motor control circuit. When the &quot;Start&quot; pushbutton is pressed, the motor energizes, but it shuts down immediately when the &quot;Start&quot; button is released:</p>

<p>Based on this information, identify two possible faults that could account for the problem and all measured values in this circuit, and also identify two circuit elements that could not possibly be to blame (i.e. two things that you know <em>must</em> be functioning properly, no matter what else may be faulted). The circuit elements you identify as either possibly faulted or properly functioning can be wires and connections as well as components. Be as specific as you can in your answers, identifying both the circuit element and the type of fault.</p>
