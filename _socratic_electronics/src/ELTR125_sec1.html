<p>Some students find it quite difficult to grasp why the DC output voltage of a common-emitter amplifier <em>decreases</em> as the DC input voltage level increases. Step-by-step DC analysis of the circuit is the only remedy I have found to this conceptual block: getting students to carefully analyze what happens as voltages increase and decrease.</p>
<p>Transistors (at least BJTs) are unilateral, DC-only devices, which leads to a problem if we wish to use them to amplify AC signals. The way we usually get around this is to <em>bias</em> them with a DC voltage in order to &quot;trick&quot; them into staying in conduction through more of the AC cycle. Realizing that biasing is nothing more than a clever trick used to make a DC-only device handle AC signals is a major step in understanding how it works.</p>
