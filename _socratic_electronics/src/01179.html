<p>Calculate the approximate <em>input impedance</em> (<span class="math"><em>Z</em><sub><em>i</em><em>n</em></sub></span>) of this amplifier circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01179x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Also, explain why input impedance is an important factor in amplifier circuits.</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>Z</em><sub><em>i</em><em>n</em></sub> = </span> 152 k<span class="math">Ω </span></p>
<p>I won’t directly tell you why input impedance is an important factor for amplifier circuits, but I’ll give you a hint: <em>Maximum Power Transfer Theorem</em>.</p>
<p>Ask you students to compare the input impedance of this amplifier with the load impedance. Does the transistor &quot;match&quot; impedances like a transformer does? Ask them to explain both the similarities and the differences between transformers and transistors as impedance-matching devices.</p>
