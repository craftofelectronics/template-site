<p>Two 5 H inductors connected in series are subjected to an electric current that changes at a rate of 4.5 amps per second. How much voltage will be dropped across the series combination?</p>
<p>Now suppose that two 5 H inductors connected in parallel are subjected to the same total applied current (changing at a rate of 4.5 amps per second). How much voltage will be dropped by these inductors? Hint: the total current is divided evenly between the two inductors.</p>
<p>Series connection: 45 volts total. Parallel connection: 11.25 volts total.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: what do these figures indicate about the nature of series-connected and parallel connected inductors? In other words, what single inductor value is equivalent to two series-connected 5 H inductors, and what single inductor value is equivalent to two parallel-connected 5 H inductors?</p>
<p>If your students are having difficulty answering the follow-up question in the Answer, ask them to compare these voltage figures (45 V and 11.25 V) against the voltage that would be dropped by just one of the 5 H inductors under the same condition (an applied current changing at a rate of 4.5 amps per second).</p>
<p>It is, of course, important that students know how series-connected and parallel connected inductors behave. However, this is typically a process of rote memorization for students rather than true understanding. With this question, the goal is to have students come to a realization of inductor connections based on their understanding of series and parallel voltages and currents.</p>
