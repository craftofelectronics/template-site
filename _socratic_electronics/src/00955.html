<p>In this graph you will see three different load lines plotted, representing three different values of load resistance in the amplifier circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00955x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Which one of the three load lines represents the largest value of load resistance (<span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>l</em><em>o</em><em>a</em><em>d</em></sub></span>)? Which of the three load lines will result in the greatest amount of change in voltage drop across the transistor (<span class="math">Δ <em>V</em><sub><em>C</em><em>E</em></sub></span>) for any given amount of base current change (<span class="math">Δ <em>I</em><sub><em>B</em></sub></span>)? What do these relationships indicate about the load resistor’s effect on the amplifier circuit’s <em>voltage gain</em>?</p>
<p>The load line closest to horizontal represents the largest value of load resistance, and it also represents the condition in which <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>C</em><em>E</em></sub></span> will vary the most for any given amount of base current (input signal) change.</p>
<p>This question challenges students to relate load resistor values to load lines, and both to the practical measure of voltage gain in a simple amplifier circuit. As an illustration, ask the students to analyze changes in the circuit for an input signal that varies between 5 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>A and 10 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>A for the three different load resistor values. The difference in <span class="math">Δ <em>V</em><sub><em>C</em><em>E</em></sub></span> should be very evident!</p>
