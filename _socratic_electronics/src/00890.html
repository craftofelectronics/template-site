<p>Describe how a zener diode is able to maintain regulated (nearly constant) voltage across the load, despite changes in load current:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00890x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The zener draws more or less current as necessary from the generator (through the series resistor) to maintain voltage at a nearly constant value.</p>
<p>Follow-up question #1: if the generator happens to output some ripple voltage (as all electromechanical DC generators do), will any of that ripple voltage appear at the load, after passing through the zener diode voltage regulator circuit?</p>
<p>Follow-up question #2: would you classify the zener diode in this circuit as a <em>series</em> voltage regulator or a <em>shunt</em> voltage regulator? Explain your answer.</p>
<p>Challenge question: at what point is the zener diode unable to regulate load voltage? Is there some critical load condition at which the diode ceases to regulate voltage?</p>
<p>Ask your students to describe how energy-efficient they think this circuit is. Do they suspect it would be more suitable for low-current applications or high-current applications?</p>
