<p>The following RC circuit constitutes an <em>automatic reset</em> network for the counter. At power-up, it resets the counter to 0000, then allows it to count normally:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03902x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Predict how the operation of this automatic reset circuit will be affected as a result of the following faults. Consider each fault independently (i.e. one at a time, no multiple faults):</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> fails open:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span> fails open:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>3</sub></span> fails open:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Capacitor <span class="math"><em>C</em><sub>1</sub></span> fails shorted:</p>
<p>For each of these conditions, explain <em>why</em> the resulting effects will occur.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> fails open: <em>Counter may not reset at power-up.</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span> fails open: <em>Counter will not count, output stuck at 0000.</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>3</sub></span> fails open: <em>Counter will not count, output stuck at 0000.</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Capacitor <span class="math"><em>C</em><sub>1</sub></span> fails shorted: <em>Counter will not count, output stuck at 0000.</em></p>
<p>Follow-up question: suggest some reasonable values for the three resistors and the capacitor.</p>
<p>The purpose of this question is to approach the domain of circuit troubleshooting from a perspective of knowing what the fault is, rather than only knowing what the symptoms are. Although this is not necessarily a realistic perspective, it helps students build the foundational knowledge necessary to diagnose a faulted circuit from empirical data. Questions such as this should be followed (eventually) by other questions asking students to identify likely faults based on measurements.</p>
