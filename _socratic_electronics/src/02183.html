<p>An oscilloscope is connected to a low-current AC motor circuit to measure both voltage and current, and plot them against one another as a Lissajous figure:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02183x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The following Lissajous figure is obtained from this measurement:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02183x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>From this figure, calculate the phase angle (<span class="math">Θ </span>) and the power factor for this motor circuit.</p>
<p><span class="math">Θ </span> <span class="math"> ≈ </span> 57<span class="math">$^{o}$</span> P.F. <span class="math"> ≈ </span> 0.54</p>
<p>Follow-up question: is this the only way we could have used the oscilloscope to measure phase shift between voltage and current, or is there another mode of operation besides plotting Lissajous figures?</p>
<p>Ask your students to explain the function of the resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>s</em><em>h</em><em>u</em><em>n</em><em>t</em></sub></span> shown in the schematic diagram. Discuss whether or not this resistor should have a very low or a very high resistance value. Also discuss the placement of the oscilloscope’s ground clip, which is very important in a potentially lethal AC power circuit.</p>
