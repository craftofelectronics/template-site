<p>An easy way to increase the effective current gain of a transistor is to &quot;cascade&quot; two of them in a configuration called a <em>Darlington pair</em>:</p>

<p>Complete this schematic diagram, showing how a Darlington pair could be used to enable a cadmium sulfide (CdS) photocell to turn a motor on and off:</p>

<p>Ask your students to define &quot;gain&quot; as it applies to a transistor circuit. Ask them to explain why a Darlington pair has a greater current gain than a single transistor, and why that trait is important in a circuit such as this.</p>
