<p>What value of resistor would need to be connected in series with a 75 mH inductor in order to provide a <em>time constant</em> (<span class="math"><em>Ï„</em></span>) of 20 microseconds? Express your answer in the form of a five-band precision resistor color code (with a tolerance of +/- 0.25%).</p>

<p>In order for students to answer this question, they must research the LR time constant equation and review the 5-band resistor color code.</p>
