<p>The 74HC154 is a high-speed CMOS (TTL-compatible) integrated circuit decoder with four input lines and sixteen output lines:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03012x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Identify the logic states of all output terminals given the input conditions shown.</p>
<p>Now, identify the logic states for the same circuit, this time with a square wave (on/off pulse) logic signal applied to the enable terminals:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03012x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>In the first scenario with the enable lines grounded, output #11 will be low, with all other outputs high. In the second scenario with a square wave signal input to the enable lines, output #11 will pulse while all other outputs remain in the high state.</p>
<p>This question previews the use of a decoder as a demultiplexer.</p>
