<p>In each of these circuits, calculate the amount of load impedance &quot;seen&quot; by the voltage sources given the turns ratio of each transformer:</p>

<p>Hint: &quot;impedance&quot; (<span class="math"><em>Z</em></span>) is defined mathematically as the ratio of voltage (<span class="math"><em>E</em></span>) to current (<span class="math"><em>I</em></span>).</p>

<p>The setup of this problem may confuse some students, with reference to the amount of impedance that a source &quot;sees&quot;. Hopefully, the anthropomorphic language will not be a barrier to understanding. The point is, for students to realize that just as a load can have a voltage or a current &quot;impressed&quot; upon it, a source can have a load &quot;impressed&quot; upon it as well. In this particular question, the issue is how the 1:2 step-down transformer ratio affects the amount of loading impressed upon the 240 VAC source by the 30 ohm resistor. That the resistor &quot;sees&quot; the same source voltage should be obvious. That the sources see very different impedance loadings (due to the transformer) is the purpose of this question.</p>
