<p>What is a <em>priority</em> encoder circuit, and how does it differ from a regular encoder? Find a datasheet for a priority encoder, and explain how the encoder circuit works.</p>
<p>A <em>priority</em> encoder encodes only the highest-order active input, even if multiple inputs are activated.</p>
<p>Be sure to ask your students where and how they found their respective priority encoder datasheets.</p>
