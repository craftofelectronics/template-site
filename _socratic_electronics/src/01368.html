<p>An extremely popular variation on the theme of an S-R flip-flop is the so-called <em>J-K flip-flop</em> circuit shown here:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01368x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Note that an S-R flip-flop becomes a J-K flip-flop by adding another layer of feedback from the outputs back to the enabling NAND gates (which are now three-input, instead of two-input). What does this added feedback accomplish? Express your answer in the form of a truth table.</p>
<p>One way to consider the feedback lines going back to the first NAND gates is to regard them as extra <em>enable</em> lines, with the <span class="math"><em>Q</em></span> and <span class="math">$\overline{Q}$</span> outputs selectively enabling just one of those NAND gates at a time.</p>

<p>Follow-up question: comment on the difference between this truth table, and the truth table for an S-R flip-flop. Are there any operational advantages you see to J-K flip-flops over S-R flip-flops that makes them so much more popular?</p>
<p>I have found that J-K flip-flop circuits are best analyzed by setting up input conditions (1’s and 0’s) on a schematic diagram, and then following all the gate output changes at the next clock pulse transition. A technique that really works well in the classroom for doing this is to project a schematic diagram on a clean whiteboard using an overhead projector or computer projector, then writing the 1 and 0 states with pen on the board. This allows you to quickly erase the 1’s and 0’s after each analysis without having to re-draw the schematic diagram. As always, I recommend you have students actually do the writing, with you taking the role of a coach, helping them rather than simply doing the thinking for them.</p>
