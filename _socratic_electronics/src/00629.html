<p>Devise a method of identifying the poles of a magnet that is too large and heavy to move.</p>
<p>I’ll give you a hint: you could use another magnet!</p>
<p>This is another question designed to provoke students to think creatively in problem-solving. They should already understand the principle of suspending a magnet and using the Earth’s natural magnetic field to identify the magnet’s poles. However, this requires allowing the magnet to freely rotate (hence the requirement of suspension) so it can act as a compass. Using the same process to identify the poles of an immovable magnet may require the use of an intermediary magnet, combined with the knowledge of magnet pole interactions (repulsion versus attraction).</p>
