<p>One way to achieve the phase shift necessary for regenerative feedback in an oscillator circuit is to use multiple RC phase-shifting networks:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02263x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>What must the voltage gain be for the common-emitter amplifier if the total voltage attenuation for the three phase-shifting RC networks is -29.25 dB?</p>
<p>The amplifier’s voltage gain must be (at least) +29.25 dB.</p>
<p>This question probes students’ comprehension of the Barkhausen criterion: that total loop gain must be equal or greater than unity in order for sustained oscillations to occur.</p>
