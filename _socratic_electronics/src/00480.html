<p>Calculate the voltage across the starter motor terminals of the &quot;dead&quot; car, and the current through the starter motor, while a second car is giving it a jump-start:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00480x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Regard the starter motor itself as a 0.15 <span class="math">Ω </span> resistor, and disregard any resistance of the jumper cables connecting the two cars’ electrical systems together.</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>E</em><sub><em>m</em><em>o</em><em>t</em><em>o</em><em>r</em></sub> = </span> 9.534 V</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>I</em><sub><em>m</em><em>o</em><em>t</em><em>o</em><em>r</em></sub> = </span> 63.56 A</p>
<p>For a question like this, where an equivalent schematic diagram is essential to obtaining the solution, I recommend you have a student draw their equivalent schematic on the whiteboard in front of the class, and discuss the diagram with all your students before discussing how to apply Millman’s theorem.</p>
<p>I have found it helpful for students to have them draw diagrams and mathematical solutions on a board in front of the rest of the class. Of course, you as the instructor must be careful to maintain a non-threatening environment in the classroom while students do this, as it tends to place a lot of stress on shy students. However, the ability to present graphical information to a group is a valuable skill, and exercises like this help to build it in your students.</p>
