<p>What would happen to the operation of this astable 555 timer circuit if a resistor were accidently connected between the &quot;Control&quot; terminal and ground? Explain the reason for your answer.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01435x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The addition of a resistor between the Control terminal and ground would increase the frequency of the circuit, as well as decrease the peak-to-peak amplitude of the &quot;sawtooth&quot; wave signal across the timing capacitor.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: does the addition of this resistor affect the output signal (pin 3) amplitude as well? Explain why or why not. If it amplitude is affected, does it increase or decrease with the resistor in place?</p>
<p>Ask your students to explain <em>why</em> frequency and amplitude changes in this circuit. It is far too easy for a student to simply repeat the answer given by the worksheet! Hold your students accountable to reasoning through the operation of a circuit like this.</p>
