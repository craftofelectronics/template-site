<p>The &quot;substrate&quot; connection in a MOSFET is often internally connected to the source, like this:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02361x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>This turns the MOSFET from a four-terminal device into a three-terminal device, making it easier to use. One consequence of this internal connection, though, is the creation of a <em>parasitic diode</em> between the source and drain terminals: a PN junction that exists whether we want it to or not.</p>
<p>Add this parasitic diode to the MOSFET symbol shown here (representing the MOSFET cross-section shown above), and explain how its presence affects the transistor’s use in a real circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02361x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02361x03.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Follow-up question: how does the presence of this parasitic diode allow us to positively distinguish the source terminal from the gate terminal when identifying the terminals of a MOSFET with a multimeter?</p>
<p>The presence of this diode is a very important concept for students to grasp, as it makes the MOSFET a unilateral device for most practical purposes. Discuss the significance of this diode, and contrast the characteristics of a three-terminal MOSFET against the characteristics of a three-terminal JFET, which is a truly bilateral device.</p>
