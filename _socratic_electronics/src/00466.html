<p>Suppose two wire coils are wound around a common iron core, the &quot;primary&quot; coil with 100 turns of wire and the &quot;secondary&quot; coil with 300 turns of wire:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00466x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>If the inductance of the primary coil is 2 H, what is the inductance of the secondary coil, assuming that it &quot;sees&quot; the exact same magnetic circuit as the first coil (same permeability, same cross-sectional area, same length)?</p>
<p>If an electric current changing at a rate of 30 amps per second passes through the primary coil, how much voltage will be induced in <em>each</em> coil?</p>
<p>If only half the lines of magnetic flux from the primary coil &quot;coupled&quot; with the secondary coil, how much voltage would be induced in the secondary coil, given a primary current rate-of-change of 30 amps per second?</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>L</em><sub><em>s</em></sub> = </span> 18 H</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>e</em><sub><em>p</em></sub> = </span> 60 volts</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>e</em><sub><em>s</em></sub> = </span> 180 volts</p>
<p>If only half the lines of flux coupled the two coils (<span class="math"><em>k</em> = 0. 5</span>), then <span class="math"><em>e</em><sub><em>s</em></sub> = 90</span> volts.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: what do you notice about the ratio of primary and secondary <em>inductances</em> compared with primary and secondary <em>winding turns</em>? Can you generalize this in the form of an equation?</p>
<p>The key to this question is determining the ratio of inductances, based on the ratio of turns in the windings. As the answer reveals, it is a nonlinear proportionality. The sentence where I specify the &quot;same permeability, same cross-sectional area, same length&quot; is a hint to students for what equation they need to find in order to identify the relationship between wire turns and inductance.</p>
