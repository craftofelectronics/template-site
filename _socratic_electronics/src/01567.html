<p>While studying DC circuit theory, you learned that <em>resistance</em> was an expression of a component’s opposition to electric current. Then, when studying AC circuit theory, you learned that <em>reactance</em> was another type of opposition to current. Now, a third term is introduced: <em>impedance</em>. Like resistance and reactance, impedance is also a form of opposition to electric current.</p>
<p>Explain the difference between these three quantities (resistance, reactance, and impedance) using your own words.</p>
<p>The fundamental distinction between these terms is one of abstraction: <em>impedance</em> is the most general term, encompassing both <em>resistance</em> and <em>reactance</em>. Here is an explanation given in terms of logical sets (using a <em>Venn diagram</em>), along with an analogy from animal taxonomy:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01567x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Resistance is a type of impedance, and so is reactance. The difference between the two has to do with <em>energy exchange</em>.</p>
<p>The given answer is far from complete. I’ve shown the semantic relationship between the terms resistance, reactance, and impedance, but I have only hinted at the conceptual distinctions between them. Be sure to discuss with your students what the fundamental difference is between resistance and reactance, in terms of electrical energy exchange.</p>
