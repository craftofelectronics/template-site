<p>A very important parameter in AC power circuits is <em>power factor</em>. Explain what &quot;power factor&quot; is, and define its numerical range.</p>
<p><em>Power</em> factor is the ratio between true power (Watts) and apparent power (Volt-Amps), ranging between 0 and 1 inclusive.</p>
<p>This is not the only way to define power factor (<span class="math">$P \over S$</span>), but it is perhaps the most straightforward.</p>
