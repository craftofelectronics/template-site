<p>Complete a timing diagram for this circuit, and determine its direction of count, and also whether it is a <em>synchronous</em> counter or an <em>asynchronous</em> counter:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{04052x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{04052x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>This is an <em>asynchronous</em> &quot;down&quot; counter.</p>
<p>&quot;Walk&quot; through the timing diagram given in the answer, and have students explain how the logic states correspond to a two-bit binary counting sequence.</p>
