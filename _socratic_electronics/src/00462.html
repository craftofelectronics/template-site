<p>If one coil of wire is located very close to another coil of wire, and an electric current is passed through the first coil whose magnitude changes over time, what phenomenon will occur in the second coil of wire?</p>
<p>A voltage will be induced in the second coil: <em>mutual induction</em>.</p>
<p>Be sure that students understand the answer to this question beyond saying the phrase, &quot;mutual induction.&quot; What, exactly, does this phrase mean? Reciting an equation is not a sufficient explanation, either. Ask them what some of the factors are that influence the strength of the mutual inductive effect.</p>
