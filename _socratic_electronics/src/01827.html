<p>Draw a phasor diagram showing the trigonometric relationship between resistance, reactance, and impedance in this series circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01827x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Show mathematically how the resistance and reactance combine in series to produce a total impedance (scalar quantities, all). Then, show how to analyze this same circuit using complex numbers: regarding component as having its own impedance, demonstrating mathematically how these impedances add up to comprise the total impedance (in both polar and rectangular forms).</p>

<p>I want students to see that there are two different ways of approaching a problem such as this: with <em>scalar</em> math and with <em>complex number</em> math. If students have access to calculators that can do complex-number arithmetic, the &quot;complex&quot; approach is actually simpler for series-parallel combination circuits, and it yields richer (more informative) results.</p>
<p>Ask your students to determine which of the approaches most resembles DC circuit calculations. Incidentally, this is why I tend to prefer complex-number AC circuit calculations over scalar calculations: because of the conceptual continuity between AC and DC. When you use complex numbers to represent AC voltages, currents, and impedances, almost all the rules of DC circuits still apply. The big exception, of course, is calculations involving <em>power</em>.</p>
