<p>A common term used to describe the internal workings of a programmable logic device is a <em>macrocell</em>. What, exactly, is a macrocell?</p>
<p>A macrocell is a collection of logic gates and a flip-flop, lumped together in one unit. PLDs usually have many macrocells, which may be interconnected to form a variety of synchronous logic functions.</p>
<p>Ask your students to show you where they found their information, and if they were able to determine how many macrocells are in a typical PLD.</p>
