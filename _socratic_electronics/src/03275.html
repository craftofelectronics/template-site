<p>A rectangular building foundation with an area of 18,500 square feet measures 100 feet along one side. You need to lay in a diagonal run of conduit from one corner of the foundation to the other. Calculate how much conduit you will need to make the run:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03275x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Also, write an equation for calculating this conduit run length (<span class="math"><em>L</em></span>) given the rectangular area (<span class="math"><em>A</em></span>) and the length of one side (<span class="math"><em>x</em></span>).</p>
<p>Conduit run = 210 feet, 3.6 inches from corner to corner.</p>
<p>Note: the following equation is not the only form possible for calculating the diagonal length. Do not be worried if your equation does not look exactly like this!</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$L = {{\sqrt{x^4 + A^2}} \over x}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Determining the necessary length of conduit for this question involves both the Pythagorean theorem and simple geometry.</p>
<p>Most students will probably arrive at this form for their diagonal length equation:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$L = \sqrt{x^2 + \left({A \over x}\right)^2}$</span><br /></p>
<p>While this is perfectly correct, it is an interesting exercise to have students convert the equation from this (simple) form to that given in the answer. It is also a very practical question, as equations given in reference books do not always follow the most direct form, but rather are often written in such a way as to look more esthetically pleasing. The simple and direct form of the equation shown here (in the Notes section) looks &quot;ugly&quot; due to the fraction inside the radicand.</p>
