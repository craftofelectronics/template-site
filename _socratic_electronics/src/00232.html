<p>What is the difference between a <em>plug</em> and a <em>jack</em>? What are these two devices used for? Draw the schematic diagram symbols for single-conductor plugs and jacks.</p>
<p>A &quot;plug&quot; is the male half of a temporary electrical connector, while the &quot;jack&quot; is the female half. Electrical connectors are used to make convenient connections between individual wires or sets of wires.</p>
