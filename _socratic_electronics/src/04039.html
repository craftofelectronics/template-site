<p>Analog-to-digital converter circuits (ADC) are usually equipped with analog low-pass filters to pre-condition the signal prior to digitization. This prevents signals with frequencies greater than the sampling rate from being seen by the ADC, causing a detrimental effect called <em>aliasing</em>. These analog pre-filters are thus known as <em>anti-aliasing filters</em>.</p>
<p>Determine which of the following Sallen-Key active filters is of the correct type to be used as an anti-aliasing filter:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{04039x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{04039x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The low-pass Sallen-Key filter, of course! What’s the matter? You’re not laughing at my answer. What I’m doing here is asking you to some research on Sallen-Key filters to confirm your qualitative analysis. And yes, I do expect you to be able to <em>figure out</em> which of the two filters is low-pass based on your knowledge of capacitors and op-amps, not just look up the answer in an op-amp reference book!</p>
<p>Discuss with your students various ways of identifying active filter types. What clues are present in these two circuits to reveal their filtering characteristics?</p>
