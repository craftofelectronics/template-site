<p>Trace the output waveform of this comparator circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00878x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00878x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Follow-up question: explain what the phrase <em>duty cycle</em> means with reference to a &quot;square&quot; or &quot;pulse&quot; waveform.</p>
<p>During discussion, ask your students to explain how the output waveform of this comparator circuit comes to be, step by step. Ask them how they arrived at their solution, and if there is a way this AC/DC problem can be simplified to one that is DC only for easier analysis (determining what the output voltage will do for a certain set of input conditions).</p>
