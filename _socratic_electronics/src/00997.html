<p>A very simple circuit that may be used as a <em>current regulator</em> in a DC circuit is this:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00997x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Draw a battery symbol and any necessary connecting wires to form a complete <em>DC current source</em>, that will attempt to supply a regulated amount of DC current through any given load.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00997x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The direction of current through the JFET, when used as a current regulator in this fashion, is very important. Not so much for the JFET’s sake, as for the sake of establishing the correct type of feedback (negative) to make the circuit self-regulating.</p>
<p>Discuss this circuit’s operation with your students, asking them to determine the polarity of the resistor’s voltage drop, and how that relates to the &quot;pinching off&quot; of the JFET.</p>
