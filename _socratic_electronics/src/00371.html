<p><em>Shunt</em> resistors are often used as current-measuring devices, in that they are designed to drop very precise amounts of voltage as large electric currents pass through them. By measuring the amount of voltage dropped by a shunt resistor, you will be able to determine the amount of current going through it:</p>

<p>Suppose that a shunt resistance is labeled with the following rating: <strong>150 A , 50 mV</strong>. What is the resistance of this shunt, in ohms? Express your answer in metric notation, scientific notation, and plain decimal notation.</p>
<p>Metric notation: 333.3 <span class="math"><em>μ</em>Ω </span></p>
<p>Scientific notation: <span class="math">3. 333 × 10<sup> − 4</sup></span> <span class="math">Ω </span></p>
<p>Plain decimal notation: 0.0003333 <span class="math">Ω </span></p>
<p>Ask your students how they think a resistor could be made with such a low resistance (a tiny fraction of an ohm!). What do they think a shunt resistor would look like in real life? If you happen to have a shunt resistor available in your classroom, show it to your students <em>after</em> they express their opinions on its construction.</p>
