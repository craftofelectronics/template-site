<p>Silicon-controlled rectifiers (SCRs) may be modeled by the following transistor circuit. Explain how this circuit functions, in the presence of and absence of a &quot;triggering&quot; voltage pulse at the gate terminal:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01088x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The positive feedback intrinsic to this circuit gives it hysteretic properties: once triggered &quot;on,&quot; it tends to stay on. When &quot;off,&quot; it tends to stay off (until triggered).</p>
<p>Have students demonstrate the positive feedback &quot;latching&quot; action of this circuit by drawing directions of current on a diagram for the class to see (on the whiteboard, in view of everyone). Ask your students why the circuit &quot;waits&quot; until a triggering pulse to turn on, and why it &quot;latches&quot; on once triggered.</p>
