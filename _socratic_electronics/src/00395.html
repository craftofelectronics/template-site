<p>When the switch closes, the ammeter will initially register a large amount of current, then the current will decay to a much lesser value over time as the motor speeds up:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00395x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>In view of Ohm’s Law, where current is supposed to be a direct function of voltage and resistance (<span class="math">$I = {E \over R}$</span>), explain why this happens. After all, the motor’s winding resistance does not change as it spins, and the battery voltage is fairly constant. Why, then, does the current vary so greatly between initial start-up and full operating speed?</p>
<p>What do you think the ammeter will register after the motor has achieved full (no-load) speed, if a mechanical load is placed on the motor shaft, forcing it to slow down?</p>
<p>Motor current is inversely proportional to speed, due to the counter-EMF produced by the armature as it rotates.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: draw a schematic diagram showing the equivalent circuit of battery, switch, ammeter, and motor, with the counter-EMF of the motor represented as another battery symbol. Which way must the counter-EMF voltage face, <em>opposed</em> to the battery voltage, or <em>aiding</em> the battery voltage?</p>
<p>The so-called &quot;inrush&quot; current of an electric motor during startup can be quite substantial, upwards of ten times the normal full-load current!</p>
