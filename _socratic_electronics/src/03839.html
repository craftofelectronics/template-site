<p>This circuit is supposed to energize the green lamp when the input voltage (<span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>i</em><em>n</em></sub></span>) falls between the two reference voltages set by <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>p</em><em>o</em><em>t</em>1</sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>p</em><em>o</em><em>t</em>2</sub></span>, and energize the red lamp when the input voltage exceeds both reference voltages. However, something is wrong with this circuit: the green lamp operates just as it should, but the red lamp never turns on even when it is supposed to.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03839x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>A technician decides to replace the red lamp, thinking it is burned out. This, unfortunately, does not fix the problem. Identify two possible component faults that could account for this problem, and describe what further diagnostic steps you would take to determine the precise nature of the fault.</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>U</em><sub>3</sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>Q</em><sub>1</sub></span> are the most suspect components, given the behavior of the circuit. I’ll let you figure out what to measure next!</p>
<p>Discuss your students’ answers to this question and their troubleshooting strategies. The latter part of the question, where students are asked to explain what they would do next, is the most important part!</p>
