<p>The equation relating probability of continued performance for a component or a system versus time may be expressed as follows:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math"><em>x</em> = <em>e</em><sup> − <em>t</em> / <em>m</em></sup></span><br /></p>
<p>Where,</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>x</em></span> = Probability (a number between 0 and 1, inclusive)</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>e</em></span> = Euler’s constant (<span class="math"> ≈ </span> 2.7182818)</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>t</em></span> = Time of continuous operation</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>m</em></span> = Mean Time Between Failure of the component or system</p>
<p>The unit of time for both <span class="math"><em>t</em></span> and <span class="math"><em>m</em></span> must be the same. That is, if <span class="math"><em>t</em></span> is measured in years, then <span class="math"><em>m</em></span> must also be expressed in years or else the equation will give very misleading answers.</p>
<p>Suppose, though, we were given <span class="math"><em>m</em></span> in years, and the operating time <span class="math"><em>t</em></span> in <strong>days</strong>. Substitute the relationship <span class="math"><em>t</em><sub><em>d</em></sub> = 365<em>t</em><sub><em>y</em></sub></span> into the reliability equation so that we will have a new equation that can take <span class="math"><em>t</em></span> in days (<span class="math"><em>t</em><sub><em>d</em></sub></span>) and <span class="math"><em>m</em></span> in years, and still provide the correct answer.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math"><em>x</em> = <em>e</em><sup> − <em>t</em><sub><em>d</em></sub> / 365<em>m</em></sup></span><br /></p>
<p>This is really nothing more than a simple exercise in mathematical substitution.</p>
<p>The equation came from the <em>Standard Handbook of Engineering Calculations</em> by Tyler G Hicks, P.E. (1972), page 5-21.</p>
