<p>Examine the following schematic diagram for an audio tone control circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03506x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Determine which potentiometer controls the bass (low frequency) tones and which controls the treble (high frequency) tones, and explain how you made those determinations.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03506x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The most important answer to this question is <em>how</em> your students arrived at the correct potentiometer identifications. If none of your students were able to figure out how to identify the potentiometers, give them this tip: use the <em>superposition theorem</em> to analyze the response of this circuit to both low-frequency signals and high-frequency signals. Assume that for bass tones the capacitors are opaque (<span class="math"><em>Z</em> = ∞</span>) and that for treble tones they are transparent (<span class="math"><em>Z</em> = 0</span>). The answers should be clear if they follow this technique.</p>
<p>This general problem-solving technique – analyzing two or more &quot;extreme&quot; scenarios to compare the results – is an important one for your students to become familiar with. It is extremely helpful in the analysis of filter circuits!</p>
