<p>What does the <em>normal</em> status of an electrical switch refer to? Specifically, what is the difference between a <em>normally-open</em> switch and a <em>normally-closed</em> switch?</p>
<p>The &quot;normal&quot; status of a switch refers to the open or closed status of the contacts when there is no actuating force applied to the switch.</p>
<p>An important qualification for an electrical switch to be either &quot;normally-open&quot; or &quot;normally-closed&quot; is that it have a spring to return it to its &quot;normal&quot; state in the absence of an actuating force. Latching switches such as most toggle switches really cannot be defined in terms of &quot;normally-&quot; anything. Discuss this with your students, possibly showing them some examples of momentary contact switches that <em>are</em> either N.O. or N.C.</p>
