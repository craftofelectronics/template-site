<p>In this filter circuit, how will the filter’s cutoff frequency be affected by changes in the potentiometer position? Be as specific as you can in your answer.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00703x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>This is a &quot;trick&quot; question: <span class="math"><em>f</em><sub><em>c</em><em>u</em><em>t</em><em>o</em><em>f</em><em>f</em></sub></span> is unaffected by changes in the potentiometer’s position.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: what <em>does</em> change as the potentiometer wiper is moved back and forth along its adjustment range?</p>
<p>Ask your students what the function of the op-amp is (with potentiometer feedback), taken by itself. If there were no filter circuit in place at all, but <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>i</em><em>n</em></sub></span> connected straight to the op-amp’s noninverting input, what function would the potentiometer adjustment serve?</p>
