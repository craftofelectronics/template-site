<p><em>Bipolar transistors</em> are extremely useful devices, allowing a small electric current to control the flow of a much larger electric current:</p>

<p>These devices would be even more useful to us if they were able to control alternating current (AC), but they cannot. Bipolar transistors are polarized (one-way-only) devices.</p>
<p>This fact does not prevent us from using bipolar transistors to control AC. We just have to be clever about how we do it:</p>

<p>Explain how this circuit functions. How is the transistor (a DC-only device) able to control alternating current (AC) through the load?</p>
<p>The four-diode bridge rectifies the AC loadâ€™s current into DC for the transistor to control.</p>
<p>Usually, rectifier circuits are thought of exclusively as intermediary steps between AC and DC in the context of an AC-DC power supply. They have other uses, though, as demonstrated by this interesting circuit!</p>
<p>It should be of no consequence if students have not yet studied transistors. In fact, it is a good thing to give them a very brief introduction to the function of a previously unknown component and then have them examine a circuit (the rest of which they should understand well) to ascertain an overall function. This is sometimes called the &quot;Black Box&quot; approach in engineering, and it is necessary when working around state-of-the-art electronic equipment, where you are practically guaranteed not to understand the inner workings of every subsystem and component.</p>
