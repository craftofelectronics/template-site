<p>Capacitance exists between any two conductors separated by an insulating medium. Given this fact, it makes sense that a length of two-conductor electrical cable will have capacitance distributed naturally along its length:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00203x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>There should be a way to prove the existence of such &quot;stray&quot; capacitance in a substantial length of two-conductor cable. Devise an experiment to do this.</p>
<p>It is the nature of capacitance to store electrical charges, manifested in the form of static voltage. Testing for the presence of a stored charge between the two conductors of a cable would be one way to prove the existence of capacitance within the cable. Iâ€™ll leave the details of testing for a stored electrical charge to you!</p>
<p>The purpose of this question is to make students think critically and creatively about capacitance. There is more than one way to test for capacitance in a cable, so do not limit students to one method only!</p>
