<p>Calculate the amount of voltage between points <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong> in this circuit. Be sure to identify polarity as well as magnitude:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{04046x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math">$V_{\bf AB}$</span> = 6.148 volts, <strong>A</strong> negative and <strong>B</strong> positive.</p>
<p>Nothing here but series-parallel calculation practice, combined with KVL. Ask your students to explain <em>how</em> they calculated this voltage, because there is definitely more than one way to do it!</p>
