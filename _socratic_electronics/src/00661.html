<p>If a step-up transformer has a turns ratio of 3:1, calculate the following:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> The voltage ratio (secondary:primary)</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> The current ratio (secondary:primary)</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> The winding inductance ratio (secondary:primary)</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> The load impedance ratio (secondary:primary)</p>
<p>What mathematical pattern(s) do you see between the turns ratio and these four ratios?</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> The voltage ratio (secondary:primary) = 3:1</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> The current ratio (secondary:primary) = 1:3</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> The winding inductance ratio (secondary:primary) = 9:1</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> The load impedance ratio (secondary:primary) = 9:1</p>
<p>Determining the voltage and current ratios should be trivial. Calculating the impedance ratio will likely require the set-up of an example problem, based on known values of voltage and current.</p>
<p>The most important part of this question is the identification of mathematical patterns and trends relating the turns ratio to the requested ratios. Of particular note are the inductance and impedance ratios. Why are they 9:1 and not 3:1? Ask your students what mathematical operation relates the number 3 to the number 9? If necessary, have them work through another example problem (with a different turns ratio) to see the impedance transformation ratio there, and the resulting relationship between that ratio and the turns ratio.</p>
