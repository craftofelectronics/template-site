<p>Identify the type of oscillator circuit shown in this schematic diagram, and explain the purpose of the tank circuit (<span class="math"><em>L</em><sub>1</sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>C</em><sub>1</sub></span>):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01082x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Also, write the equation describing the operating frequency of this type of oscillator circuit.</p>
<p>This is a <em>Hartley</em> oscillator circuit, and the tank circuit establishes its frequency of operation.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$f = {1 \over {2 \pi \sqrt{L_1 C_1}}}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Follow-up question: calculate the operating frequency of this oscillator circuit if <span class="math"><em>L</em><sub>1</sub></span> = 330 mH and <span class="math"><em>C</em><sub>1</sub></span> = 0.15 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>F.</p>
<p>Ask your students to describe the amount of phase shift the tank circuit provides to the feedback signal. Also, ask them to explain how the oscillator circuit’s natural frequency may be altered.</p>
