<p>What will be the consequence of one diode failing open in the bridge rectifier of a single-phase power supply?</p>
<p>The (unfiltered) output voltage will be half-wave, not full-wave.</p>
<p>A question such as this is best discussed while viewing the schematic diagram for a bridge rectifier. I recommend projecting an image of a bridge rectifier circuit on a whiteboard, then having students use dry-erase markers to &quot;mark up&quot; the schematic with arrows for current, voltage drop indications, etc. This way, mistakes can be corrected, or alternate cycles erased and re-drawn, without having to erase and re-draw the schematic diagram itself.</p>
