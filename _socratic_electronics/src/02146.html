<p>Optically-isolated TRIACs are available for use as <em>solid-state relays</em>, suitable for replacing electromechanical relays in many AC power switching applications:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02146x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Describe some of the advantages of using a solid-state relay for switching AC power instead of using an electromechanical relay as shown here:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02146x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Also describe any disadvantages to using a solid-state relay, if they exist.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages</strong></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Less DC drive current required</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> No moving parts to wear</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Zero-crossing turn-off naturally provided by the TRIAC</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <em>Any others you can think of . . . ?</em></p>
<p><strong>Disadvantages</strong></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> &quot;Off&quot; state not as high-impedance as an electromechanical relay</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Susceptible to <span class="math">${dv \over dt}$</span>-induced turn-on</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <em>Any others you can think of . . . ?</em></p>
<p>Follow-up question: what is <em>zero-crossing turn-off</em>, and what type of load might benefit most from this feature?</p>
<p>It should be noted that the label &quot;solid-state relay&quot; is not exclusively reserved for opto-TRIAC devices. Many different types of solid-state relays exist, including opto-BJT, opto-FET, and opto-SCR. Be sure to mention this to your students.</p>
