<p>Calculate the total impedance of this parallel network of impedances, in complex form:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00622x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math">${\bf Z_{total}} =$</span> 283.3 <span class="math">Ω </span> <span class="math">∠</span> 9.899<span class="math">$^{o}$</span></p>
<p>Follow-up question: overall, does this network behave more like a capacitor, an inductor, or a resistor? Explain your answer.</p>
<p>Students should find parallel impedance calculations very similar to parallel (DC) resistance calculations, the only significant difference being the use of complex instead of scalar numbers. This makes parallel impedance calculations difficult, no doubt about it. Attaining a solution for this problem will involve a lot of arithmetic, with lots of room for calculation error.</p>
