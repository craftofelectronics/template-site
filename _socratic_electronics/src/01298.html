<p>Surveying the rules for Boolean addition, the 0 and 1 values seem to resemble the truth table of a very common logic gate. Which type of gate is this, and what does this suggest about the relationship between Boolean addition and logic circuits?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\hbox{\bf{Rules for Boolean addition:}}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">0 + 0 = 0</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">0 + 1 = 1</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">1 + 0 = 1</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">1 + 1 = 1</span><br /></p>
<p>This set of Boolean expressions resembles the truth table for an OR logic gate circuit, suggesting that Boolean addition may symbolize the logical OR function.</p>
<p>Students need to be able to readily associate fundamental Boolean operations with logic circuits. If they can see the relationship between the &quot;strange&quot; rules of Boolean arithmetic and something they are already familiar with (i.e. truth tables), the association is made much easier.</p>
