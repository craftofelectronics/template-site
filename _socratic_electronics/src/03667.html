<p>A technician brings a control power transformer into your repair shop for diagnosis. It is a dual-voltage primary unit, and was used on the job site to step 480 volts down to 120 volts:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03667x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>According to the person who did the field troubleshooting, the transformer is simply &quot;bad.&quot; As is typical, you were given no other information to help diagnose the precise fault. Describe how you would test this transformer in your shop for the following faults, noting the transformer terminals you would connect your multimeter to and the type of meter measurement you would expect to see for each specified fault.</p>
