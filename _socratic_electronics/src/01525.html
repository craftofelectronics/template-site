<p>An electronic service technician prepares to work on a high-voltage power supply circuit containing one large capacitor. On the side of this capacitor are the following specifications:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\hbox{3000 WVDC \hskip 10pt} 0.75 \mu \hbox{F}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Obviously this device poses a certain amount of danger, even with the AC line power secured (lock-out/tag-out). Discharging this capacitor by directly shorting its terminals with a screwdriver or some other piece of metal might be dangerous due to the quantity of the stored charge. What needs to be done is to discharge this capacitor at a modest rate.</p>
<p>The technician realizes that she can discharge the capacitor at any rate desired by connecting a resistor in parallel with it (holding the resistor with electrically-insulated pliers, of course, to avoid having to touch either terminal). What size resistor should she use, if she wants to discharge the capacitor to less than 1% charge in 15 seconds? State your answer using the standard 4-band resistor color code (tolerance = +/- 10%).</p>
<p>Yellow, Black, Green, Silver (assuming 5 time constantsâ€™ worth of time: just less than 1% charge). Yellow, Orange, Green, Silver for a discharge down to 1% in 15 seconds.</p>
<p>In order to answer this question, students must not only be able to calculate time constants for a simple RC circuit, but they must also remember the resistor color code so as to choose the right size based on color. A very practical problem, and important for safety reasons too!</p>
