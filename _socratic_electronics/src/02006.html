<p>Draw an energy diagram for a PN semiconductor junction showing the motion of electrons and holes conducting an electric current.</p>
<p>For the sake of clearly seeing the actions of charge carriers (mobile electrons and holes), non-moving electrons in the valence bands are not shown:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02006x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The &quot;+&quot; and &quot;-&quot; signs show the locations of ionized acceptor and donor atoms, having taken on electric charges to create valence-band holes and conduction-band electrons, respectively.</p>
<p><em>Note: <span class="math"><em>E</em><sub><em>f</em></sub></span> represents the Fermi energy level, and not a voltage. In physics, <span class="math"><em>E</em></span> always stands for energy and <span class="math"><em>V</em></span> for potential (voltage).</em></p>
<p>Students will probably ask why there are a few holes shown in the N-type valence band, and why there are a few electrons in the P-type conduction band. Let them know that just because N-type materials are specifically designed to have conduction-band electrons does not mean they are completely devoid of valence-band holes, and visa-versa! What your students see here are <em>minority carriers</em>.</p>
