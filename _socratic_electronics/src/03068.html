<p>The resistance of a piece of copper wire at temperature <span class="math"><em>T</em></span> (in degrees Celsius) is given by the following formula:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>T</em></sub> = <em>R</em><sub><em>o</em></sub>[1 + 0. 004041(<em>T</em> − 20)]</span><br /></p>
<p>Suppose you wished to alter this formula so it could accept values for <span class="math"><em>T</em></span> in units of degrees Fahrenheit instead of degrees Celsius. Suppose also that the only formula you are able to find for converting between Fahrenheit (<span class="math"><em>T</em><sub><em>F</em></sub></span>) and Celsius (<span class="math"><em>T</em><sub><em>C</em></sub></span>) is this one:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$T_F = T_C \left({9 \over 5}\right) + 32$</span><br /></p>
<p>Combined these two formulae into one solving for the resistance of a copper wire sample (<span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>T</em></sub></span>) at a specific temperature in degrees Celsius (<span class="math"><em>T</em><sub><em>C</em></sub></span>), given the specimen’s &quot;reference&quot; resistance (<span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>o</em></sub></span>) at 20<span class="math">$^{o}$</span> Celsius (room temperature).</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$R_T = R_o \left[1 + 0.004041\left({5 \over 9}T_F - 37.\overline{77}\right)\right]$</span><br /></p>
<p>Solving this algebraic problem requires both manipulation of the temperature equation <em>and</em> substitution of variables. One important detail I incorporated into this question is the lack of a subscript for <span class="math"><em>T</em></span> in the original resistance formula. In the first sentence I identify that temperature as being in degrees Celsius, but since there is no other <span class="math"><em>T</em></span> variables in the equation, I did not have to include a &quot;C&quot; subscript. When students look to the Celsius-Fahrenheit conversion formula to substitute into the resistance formula, they must decide which <span class="math"><em>T</em></span> in the conversion formula to use, <span class="math"><em>T</em><sub><em>F</em></sub></span> or <span class="math"><em>T</em><sub><em>C</em></sub></span>. Here, I purposely wrote the conversion formula in terms of <span class="math"><em>T</em><sub><em>F</em></sub></span> to see how many students would blindly substitute <span class="math"><em>T</em><sub><em>F</em></sub></span> for <span class="math"><em>T</em></span> in the resistance formula instead of properly identifying <span class="math"><em>T</em><sub><em>C</em></sub></span> as the variable to substitute and doing the work of manipulation.</p>
<p>Far from being a &quot;trick&quot; question, this scenario is very realistic. Formulae found in reference manuals do not necessarily use standardized variables, but rather cast their variables according to context. Multiple formulae will most likely not be written with <em>identical</em> subscripted variables just waiting to be substituted. It is the domain of the intelligent technician, engineer, or scientist to figure out what variables are appropriate to substitute based on context!</p>
