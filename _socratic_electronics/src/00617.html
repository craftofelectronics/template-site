<p>Identify what type of filter this circuit is, and calculate its cutoff frequency given a resistor value of 1 k<span class="math">Ω </span> and a capacitor value of 0.22 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>F:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00617x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Calculate the impedance of both the resistor and the capacitor at this frequency. What do you notice about these two impedance values?</p>
<p>This is a <em>low-pass</em> filter.</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>f</em><sub><em>c</em><em>u</em><em>t</em><em>o</em><em>f</em><em>f</em></sub></span> = 723.4 Hz</p>
<p>Be sure to ask students where they found the cutoff frequency formula for this filter circuit.</p>
<p>When students calculate the impedance of the resistor and the capacitor at the cutoff frequency, they should notice something unique. Ask your students why these values are what they are at the cutoff frequency. Is this just a coincidence, or does this tell us more about how the &quot;cutoff frequency&quot; is defined for an RC circuit?</p>
