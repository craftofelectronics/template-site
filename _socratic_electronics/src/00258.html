<p>Write an equation that expresses the amount of magnetic flux (<span class="math">Φ </span>) produced by an electromagnet, given the amount of electric current (<span class="math"><em>I</em></span>), the number of turns in the wire coil (<span class="math"><em>N</em></span>), and the reluctance of the core material (<span class="math">ℜ</span>).</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\Phi = {NI \over \Re}$</span><br /></p>
<p>This is an exercise in algebraic substitution. Students are not likely to find this equation anywhere, so they’ll have to create it from a combination of two other equations.</p>
