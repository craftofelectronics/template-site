<p>Determine the amount of current from point <strong>A</strong> to point <strong>B</strong> in this circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02516x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math"><em>I</em></span> = 6.5 mA</p>
<p>This question, while being an application of Kirchhoffâ€™s Current Law, is also a prelude to an inverting summer circuit, where an opamp takes that 6.5 mA (total) current and converts it into an output voltage.</p>
