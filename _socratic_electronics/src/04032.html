<p>Suppose a student builds this circuit, using 10 M<span class="math">Ω </span> resistors for <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span>, and a 22 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>F capacitor for <span class="math"><em>C</em><sub>1</sub></span>, and finds that he must frequently adjust the potentiometer to keep the circuit at a reasonable level of sensitivity. A fellow student has encountered and overcome this same problem, and offers to fix the first student’s circuit by replacing the 22 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>F capacitor with something much smaller: a 0.001 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>F (1 nF) capacitor.</p>
<p>Now, the modified circuit responds predictably. No longer must the student frequently adjust the potentiometer to achieve the desired sensitivity. Explain why a change in capacitance made such a difference, and what the problem was in the original circuit (with the much larger capacitor).</p>
<p>Here’s a hint: calculate the time constant (<span class="math"><em>τ</em></span>) for the RC network formed by <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span>, <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span>, and <span class="math"><em>C</em><sub>1</sub></span>.</p>
<p>In order to understand the problem, students must recognize the function of this RC network: to filter out the DC bias voltage created by ambient light falling on the LED array, and to replace that changing bias with a fixed bias voltage equal to <span class="math">$1 \over 2$</span> <span class="math">$V_{\hbox{supply}}$</span>. Once this purpose is grasped, the problem of a slow time constant should be much more apparent.</p>
