<p>An important performance parameter of digital communications networks is the number of <em>bits per second</em> (bps) of data it can handle. Unfortunately, a different term called <em>baud</em> is often used interchangeably with <em>bps</em>. Define what &quot;baud&quot; is, and how it differs from &quot;bits per second.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Baud&quot; technically refers to the number of logic level transitions (low-to-high or high-to-low) per second on a network, while &quot;bps&quot; actually refers to the number of data bits transmitted per second. For a specific application where the two terms significantly differ, research a method of data modulation known as <em>Manchester encoding</em>.</p>
<p>While some may argue the difference to be academic, I believe that precision of language and precision of thinking are closely related. The person who does not recognize the difference between &quot;baud&quot; and &quot;bps&quot; most likely knows little about how digital information is encoded for serial transmission. Of course, this is the ultimate issue – understanding how digital data is transmitted. So while we’re at it, we might as well address a common mis-use of language and gain a deeper understanding of how things work, right?</p>
