<p>Describe the purpose and operation of a <em>crystal</em> in an oscillator circuit. What physical principle does the crystal exploit, and what other components could be substituted in place of a crystal in an oscillator circuit?</p>
<p>A &quot;crystal&quot; is a chip of <em>piezoelectric</em> material that acts as an electromechanical tank circuit.</p>
<p>Ask your students to describe the phenomenon of piezoelectricity, and how this principle works inside an oscillator crystal. Also, ask them why crystals are used instead of tank circuits in so many precision oscillator circuits.</p>
