<p>Use circuit simulation software to verify your predicted and measured parameter values.</p>
<p>Students are free to choose any oscillator design that meets the criteria: sinusoidal output at a specified frequency.</p>
<p>An extension of this exercise is to incorporate troubleshooting questions. Whether using this exercise as a performance assessment or simply as a concept-building lab, you might want to follow up your studentsâ€™ results by asking them to predict the consequences of certain circuit faults.</p>
