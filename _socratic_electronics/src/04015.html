<p>Explain the operating principle of this analog-to-digital converter circuit, usually referred to as a <em>successive-approximation</em> converter:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{04015x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Note: the successive-approximation register (SAR) is a special type of binary counting circuit which begins counting with the most-significant bit (MSB), then the next-less-significant bit, in order all the way down to the LSB. At that point, it outputs a &quot;high&quot; signal at the &quot;Complete&quot; output terminal. The operation of this register may be likened to the manual process of converting a decimal number to binary by &quot;trial and fit&quot; with the MSB first, through all the successive bits down to the LSB.</p>
<p>The successive approximation register counts up and down as necessary to &quot;zero in&quot; on the analog input voltage, resulting in a binary output that locks into the correct value once every <span class="math"><em>n</em></span> clock cycles, where <span class="math"><em>n</em></span> is the number of bits the DAC inputs.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: this form of ADC is much more effective at following fast-changing input signals than the <em>tracking</em> converter design. Explain why.</p>
<p>Have your students express the answer to this question in their own words, not just copying the answer I provide. Aside from the flash converter, the tracking converter is one of the easiest ADC circuits to understand.</p>
