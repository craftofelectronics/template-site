<p>One analogy used to explain and contrast negative feedback versus positive feedback is that of a round stone, placed on either a hilltop or a valley:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01149x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The stability of the stone in each of these scenarios represents the stability of a specific type of electrical feedback system. Which of these scenarios represents negative feedback, which represents positive feedback, and why?</p>
<p>The valley represents negative feedback, while the hill represents positive feedback.</p>
<p>I have found this simple analogy to be most helpful when explaining feedback systems to students, because the behavior of each is intuitively obvious.</p>
