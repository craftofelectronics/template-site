<p>Compare and contrast inverting versus noninverting amplifier circuits constructed using operational amplifiers:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02469x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>How do these two general forms of opamp circuit compare, especially in regard to input impedance and the range of voltage gain adjustment?</p>
<p>The noninverting configuration exhibits a far greater input impedance than the inverting amplifier, but has a more limited range of voltage gain: always greater than or equal to unity.</p>
<p>Just a simple comparison between amplifier configurations, nothing more. Ask your students to elaborate on the inverting amplifierâ€™s range of gain adjustment: how does it differ from the noninverting configuration?</p>
