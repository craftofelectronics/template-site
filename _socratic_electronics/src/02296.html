<p>Use circuit simulation software to verify your predicted and measured parameter values.</p>
<p>I recommend using 1N400X series rectifying diodes for all rectifier circuit designs. Make sure that the resistance value you specify for your load is not so low that the resistor’s power dissipation is exceeded.</p>
<p>An extension of this exercise is to incorporate troubleshooting questions. Whether using this exercise as a performance assessment or simply as a concept-building lab, you might want to follow up your students’ results by asking them to predict the consequences of certain circuit faults.</p>
