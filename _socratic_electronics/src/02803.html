<p>Simplify this logic gate circuit, which uses nothing but NOR gates to accomplish a certain logic function:</p>

<p>This question stands as an example of how NOR gates may be used to construct different types of logic functions. In fact, with a sufficient quantity of NOR gates, <em>any</em> logic function may be built. This is why NOR gates are said to be &quot;universal.&quot;</p>
