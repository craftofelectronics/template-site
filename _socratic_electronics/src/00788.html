<p>AC-DC power supply circuits are one of the most common circuit configurations in electronic systems. Though designs may vary, the task of converting AC power to DC power is vital in the functioning of a great many electronic devices.</p>
<p>Why is this? What is it about this kind of circuit that makes it such a necessary part of many electronic systems?</p>
<p>Most electric power distribution systems are AC, yet most electronic circuits function on DC power.</p>
<p>One factor not mentioned in the answer is circuit operating voltage. How do the operating voltages of a typical AC power system and a typical electronic circuit (radio, alarm clock, computer) compare? Ask your students what purpose a power supply has with regard to voltage.</p>
<p>Ask your students if the word &quot;supply&quot; is truly appropriate for this type of circuit. Does it really <em>supply</em> energy, or does it just convert energy from one form into another?</p>
