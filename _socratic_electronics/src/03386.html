<p>Examine the following specific resistance table for various metals:</p>
<p><span class="math"></span><span class="math"></span> Of the metals shown, which is the best conductor of electricity? Which is the worst? What do you notice about the resistivity of these metals as temperature is increased from 32<span class="math">$^{o}$</span>F to 75 <span class="math">$^{o}$</span>F?</p>
<p>Here is the same table, the order re-arranged to show resistivity from least to greatest:</p>
<p><span class="math"></span><span class="math"></span></p>
<p>The data for this table was taken from table 1-97 of the <em>American Electrician’s Handbook</em> (eleventh edition) by Terrell Croft and Wilford Summers.</p>
<p>It may come as a surprise to some students to find that gold is actually a worse conductor of electricity than copper, but the data doesn’t lie! <em>Silver</em> is actually the best, but gold is chosen for a lot of microelectronic applications because of its resistance to oxidation.</p>
