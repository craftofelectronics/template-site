<p>Check with your instructor to see whether or not your design looks viable.</p>
<p>The purpose of this form is to get students thinking in more concrete terms about what they intend to build. Too often, students begin assembling a prototype without a clear idea of what their circuit should look like. Once students have documented their rough ideas, the instructor may provide more targeted help to each student or team of students before they begin assembly.</p>
