<p>The armature windings of your DC motor will have very low resistance. Too low, in fact, to accurately measure with an ohmmeter connected directly to the commutator terminals, because the contact resistance between the meter probes and terminals will be a large percentage of the resistance read by the meter.</p>
<p>One way to avoid this contact resistance problem and measure very low resistances using normal meters is to employ what is known as the <em>Kelvin resistance measurement technique</em>: measuring the voltage dropped by the low-resistance element when a substantial DC current is passed through it.</p>
<p>Draw a diagram showing how this measurement technique works, and explain <em>why</em> it works.</p>

<p><span class="math"><em>R</em></span> is calculated by way of Ohmâ€™s Law.</p>
<p>Kelvin resistance measurement is a very common technique used in electrical metrology, because it neatly sidesteps the problem of contact resistance in the path of high current. It is a technique well worth learning for the serious student of electronics.</p>
