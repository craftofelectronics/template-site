<p>Shown here is a schematic diagram for a class-C RF (radio frequency) amplifier circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02506x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>This circuit will look very strange if you are accustomed to analyzing audio-frequency and DC amplifier circuits. Note some of the distinct differences between this amplifier and an amplifier used to boost audio signals. Also, explain what &quot;class-C&quot; operation means, and how this amplifier is able to output a continuous sine wave despite the transistor’s behavior in class-C mode.</p>
<p>Finally, write an equation that predicts this amplifier’s operating frequency, based on certain component values which you identify.</p>
<p>Operating in class-C mode, the transistor only turns on for a very brief moment in time during the waveform cycle. The &quot;flywheel&quot; action of the tank circuit maintains a sinusoidal output waveform during the time the transistor is off.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$f = {1 \over {2 \pi \sqrt{L_1 C_2}}}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Follow-up question: why is this mode of amplifier operation – where the transistor is off most of the time and a tank circuit sustains sinusoidal oscillations – desirable for an amplifier circuit? Could this technique be applied to audio-frequency amplifier circuits? Why or why not?</p>
<p>Perhaps the most noteworthy detail of this circuit is the positive biasing voltage, despite the transistor being PNP and <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>C</em></sub><em>C</em></span> being negative. Ask your students to explain why this is necessary to get the transistor operating in class-C mode.</p>
