<p>Find one or two real integrated circuits and bring them with you to class discussion. Identify as much information as you can about your ICs prior to discussion:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Manufacturer</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Part number</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Function</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Datasheet</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Date of manufacture</p>
<p>You will find a wealth of information on manufacturers’ websites, on the internet!</p>
<p>The purpose of this question is to get students to kinesthetically interact with the subject matter. It may seem silly to have students engage in a &quot;show and tell&quot; exercise, but I have found that activities such as this greatly help some students. For those learners who are kinesthetic in nature, it is a great help to actually <em>touch</em> real components while they’re learning about their function. Of course, this question also provides an excellent opportunity for them to practice interpreting component markings, use a multimeter, access datasheets, etc.</p>
