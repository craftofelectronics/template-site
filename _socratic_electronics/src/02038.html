<p>The &quot;beta&quot; ratio (<span class="math"><em>β</em></span>) of a bipolar junction transistor, sometimes alternatively referred to as <span class="math"><em>h</em><sub><em>F</em><em>E</em></sub></span>, is a very important device parameter. In essence, it describes the amplifying power of the transistor. Give a mathematical definition for this parameter, and provide some typical values from transistor datasheets.</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>β</em></span> is defined as the ratio between collector and base current. I’ll let you research some typical values. Here are some transistor part numbers you could research datasheets for:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> 2N2222</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> 2N2905</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> 2N2907</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> 2N3403</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> 2N3703</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> 2N3904</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> 2N3906</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> 2N4125</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> 2N4403</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> 2N3055</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> TIP 29</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> TIP 31</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> TIP 32</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> TIP 41</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> TIP 42</p>
<p>Follow-up question #1: what conditions affect the <span class="math"><em>β</em></span> ratio of a transistor?</p>
<p>Follow-up question #2: re-write the <span class="math"><em>β</em></span> equation to solve for the other variables (<span class="math"><em>I</em><sub><em>C</em></sub> = ⋯</span> , <span class="math"><em>I</em><sub><em>B</em></sub> = ⋯</span>).</p>
<p>Ask your students to show you at least one datasheets for one of the listed transistors. With internet access, datasheets are extremely easy to locate. Your students will need to be able to locate component datasheets and application notes as part of their work responsibilities, so be sure they know how and where to access these valuable documents!</p>
<p>The follow-up question is an important one to discuss, as <span class="math"><em>β</em></span> is far from stable for most transistors! This point is often overlooked in basic electronics textbooks, leaving students with the false impression that transistor circuit calculations using <span class="math"><em>β</em></span> are far more accurate than they actually are.</p>
