<p>This is a schematic diagram of a <em>Y-connected</em> three-phase generator (with the rotor winding shown):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02199x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>How much AC voltage will appear between any two of the lines (<span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>A</em><em>B</em></sub></span>, <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>B</em><em>C</em></sub></span>, or <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>A</em><em>C</em></sub></span>) if each stator coil inside the alternator outputs 277 volts? Draw a phasor diagram showing how the phase (winding) and line voltages relate.</p>
<p>Phase voltage = 277 volts AC (given)</p>
<p>Line voltage = <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>A</em><em>B</em></sub> = <em>V</em><sub><em>B</em><em>C</em></sub> = <em>V</em><sub><em>A</em><em>C</em></sub> = </span> 480 volts AC</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02199x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Follow-up question #1: what is the ratio between the line and phase voltage magnitudes in a Y-connected three-phase system?</p>
<p>Follow-up question #2: what would happen to the output of this alternator if the rotor winding were to fail open? Bear in mind that the rotor winding is typically energized with DC through a pair of brushes and slip rings from an external source, the current through this winding being used to control voltage output of the alternator’s three-phase &quot;stator&quot; windings.</p>
<p>Students will quickly discover that <span class="math">$\sqrt{3}$</span> is the &quot;magic number&quot; for practically all balanced three-phase circuit calculations!</p>
<p>It should be noted that although the <em>magnitudes</em> of <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>A</em><em>B</em></sub></span>, <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>B</em><em>C</em></sub></span>, and <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>A</em><em>C</em></sub></span> are equal, their phasor angles are most definitely not. Therefore,</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$V_{AB} = V_{BC} = V_{AC} \hbox{\hskip 20pt Scalar values equal}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">${\bf V_{AB}} \neq {\bf V_{BC}} \neq {\bf V_{AC}} \hbox{\hskip 20pt Phasors unequal}$</span><br /></p>
