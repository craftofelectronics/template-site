<p>Ideally, what should the output voltage of an op-amp do if the noninverting voltage is greater (more positive) than the inverting voltage?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00802x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>In this condition, the output of the op-amp should saturate positive (+V), as if a direct connection were made inside the op-amp between the output terminal and the +V power supply terminal:</p>

<p>Determining which &quot;way&quot; the output of an op-amp drives under different input voltage conditions is confusing to many students. Discuss this with them, and ask them to present any principles or analogies they use to remember &quot;which way is which.&quot;</p>
