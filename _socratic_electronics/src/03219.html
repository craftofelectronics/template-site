<p>Likewise, it should be apparent that the load voltage in this <em>inductive</em> voltage divider circuit will be less than 30 volts AC (RMS):</p>

<p>From this brief analysis it would appear these two voltage divider circuits are equivalent to one another. However, there is a very important difference in terms of <em>current</em>: load versus supply. Estimate the load and source currents in each of these divider circuits, and comment on the difference(s) between the two.</p>
<p>In the resistive circuit, the load current will be less than the supply current. In the inductive (autotransformer) circuit, though, the load current will exceed the source current!</p>
<p>Ask your students to determine which voltage divider circuit will be more energy-efficient.</p>
