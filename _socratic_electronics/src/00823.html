<p>Calculate the approximate quiescent (DC) base current for this transistor circuit, assuming an AC input voltage of 0 volts, and a silicon transistor:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00823x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math"><em>I</em><sub><em>B</em></sub> = </span> 38.3 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>A</p>
<p>This circuit was purposely drawn in a convoluted fashion to force students to identify its configuration apart from the standard layout. Many people lack the spatial reasoning skills to do this easily, and require a lot of practice before they become proficient. Ask your more proficient students if they have any &quot;tips&quot; for helping those who struggle with problems like these. Are there any simple methods which we may use to re-draw this circuit in an easier-to-understand form?</p>
