<p>Research the resistance equivalence equations for each of these switched-capacitor networks (using N-channel MOSFETs as switches), describing the emulated resistance (<span class="math"><em>R</em></span>) as a function of switching frequency (<span class="math"><em>f</em></span>) and capacitance (<span class="math"><em>C</em></span>):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03789x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Note: <span class="math"><em>ϕ</em><sub>1</sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>ϕ</em><sub>2</sub></span> are two-phase, non-overlapping clock signals.</p>
<p>Circuit <strong>A</strong>: Parallel circuit <span class="math">$R = {1 \over {fC}}$</span></p>
<p>Circuit <strong>B</strong>: Series circuit <span class="math">$R = {1 \over {fC}}$</span></p>
<p>Circuit <strong>C</strong>: Series-parallel circuit <span class="math">$R = {1 \over {f(C_1 + C_2)}}$</span></p>
<p>Circuit <strong>D</strong>: Bilinear circuit <span class="math">$R = {1 \over {4fC}}$</span></p>
<p>Circuit <strong>E</strong>: Negative transresistor circuit <span class="math">$R = - {1 \over {fC}}$</span> (the negative sign indicates polarity inversion)</p>
<p>Circuit <strong>F</strong>: Positive transresistor circuit <span class="math">$R = {1 \over {fC}}$</span></p>
<p>The mathematics required to derive these equations directly may be beyond your students’ ability, but they should still be able to research them! Some of the networks are directly equivalent to one another, making it easier for your students to associate equations: for instance, circuit <strong>F</strong> is equivalent to circuit <strong>B</strong>, and circuit <strong>E</strong> is the same thing as <strong>F</strong> except for the polarity inversion. It should not take a great deal of analysis to realize that circuits <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong> must have the same equation as well.</p>
