<p>When AC power is initially applied to an electric motor (before the motor shaft has an opportunity to start moving), the motor &quot;appears&quot; to the AC power source to be a large inductor:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01826x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>If the voltage of the 60 Hz AC power source is 480 volts RMS, and the motor initially draws 75 amps RMS when the double-pole single-throw switch closes, how much inductance (<span class="math"><em>L</em></span>) must the motor windings have? Ignore any wire resistance, and assume the motorâ€™s only opposition to current in a locked-rotor condition is inductive reactance (<span class="math"><em>X</em><sub><em>L</em></sub></span>).</p>
<p><span class="math">$X_L = 16.98 \hbox{ mH}$</span></p>
<p>In reality, motor winding resistance plays a substantial part in this sort of calculation, but I simplified things a bit just to give students a practical context for their introductory knowledge of inductive reactance.</p>
