<p>The 74HC154 is a high-speed CMOS (TTL-compatible) integrated circuit decoder, which may also be used as a demultiplexer:</p>

<p>What terminal(s) do we use for the signal input, if using this chip as a <em>demultiplexer</em> and not just a decoder?</p>
<p>Use the enable terminals (together) as one &quot;input&quot; terminal.</p>
<p>Explain to your students that &quot;decoder&quot; and &quot;demultiplexer&quot; are really just two different words for the same device, seeing as how all real decoders come equipped with enable inputs.</p>
