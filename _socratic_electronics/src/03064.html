<p><em>Substitution</em> is the term we give to the mathematical equivalence of one variable to one or more other variables in an expression. It is a fundamental principle used to combine two or more equations into a single equation (among other things).</p>
<p>For example, we know that the formula for calculating current in a simple one-resistor circuit is as follows:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03064x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>We also know that the total resistance (<span class="math"><em>R</em></span>) of a three-resistor series circuit is as follows:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03064x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Combine these two equations together using substitution so that we have a single equation for calculating current <span class="math"><em>I</em></span> in a three-resistor series circuit given the source voltage <span class="math"><em>V</em></span> and each resistance value <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span>, <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span>, and <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>3</sub></span>:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03064x03.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>In other words, you need to have as your answer a single equation that begins with &quot;<span class="math"><em>I</em> = </span>&quot; and has all the variables <span class="math"><em>V</em></span>, <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span>, <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span>, and <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>3</sub></span> on the other side of the &quot;equal&quot; sign.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$I = {V \over {R_1 + R_2 + R_3}}$</span><br /></p>
<p>I like to speak of the process of substitution in terms of <em>definitions</em> for variables. In this particular case, <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub> + <em>R</em><sub>2</sub> + <em>R</em><sub>3</sub></span> is a <em>definition</em> for <span class="math"><em>R</em></span> that we put in <span class="math"><em>R</em></span>’s place in the first equation (<span class="math">$I = {V \over R}$</span>).</p>
<p>The notation shown in the third schematic, <span class="math"><em>I</em> = <em>f</em>(<em>V</em>, <em>R</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>R</em><sub>2</sub>, <em>R</em><sub>3</sub>)</span>, is known as <em>function notation</em>. It merely means that the value of <span class="math"><em>I</em></span> is determined by the values of all those variables within the parentheses, rather than just one.</p>
