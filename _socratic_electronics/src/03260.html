<p>Determine the voltages (with respect to ground) at points <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong> in this circuit under four different conditions: both loads off, load 1 on (only), load 2 on (only), and both loads on:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03260x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math"></span><br /><span class="math">$\underbar{file 03260}$</span><br /><span class="math"></span></p>
<p>Students will have to re-consider (and possible re-draw) the circuit for each loading condition, which is one of the major points of this question. The fact that a circuit can &quot;change&quot; just by throwing a switch is an important concept for electronics students to grasp.</p>
<p>Another concept employed in this question is that of voltages specified at single points with an implied reference of ground. Note to students how each voltage was simply referenced by a single letter, either <strong>A</strong> or <strong>B</strong>. Of course there is no such thing as voltage at a single point in any circuit, so we need another point to reference, and that point is ground. This is <em>very</em> commonly seen in electronic circuits of all types, and is a good thing to be exposed to early on in oneâ€™s electronics education.</p>
<p>A much less obvious point of this question is to subtly introduce the concept of discrete states (loading conditions) available with a given number of boolean elements (switches). Given two load switches, there are four possible states of circuit loading, previewing binary states in digital circuits.</p>
