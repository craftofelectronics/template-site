<p>Use circuit simulation software to verify your predicted and actual truth tables.</p>
<p>One method that is convenient for generating an analog output voltage with many microcontrollers is to program the MCU to generate a PWM output, then build an analog filter circuit to capture just the average DC value of that PWM waveform.</p>
