<p>What purpose(s) do the capacitors serve in this amplifier circuit? Could we remove one or more of them and still have a working circuit?</p>
<p>The capacitors block DC from being amplified at any stage, which may cause the amplifier(s) to saturate. The last capacitor (<span class="math"><em>C</em><sub>3</sub></span>) prevents any possible DC from getting to the headphone.</p>
<p>The circuit design shown is a bit conservative. That is, it should work well without <em>all</em> the capacitors shown. However, experience has taught me a little over-building is good when it comes to increasing circuit reliability.</p>
