<p>A primitive resistor may be formed by sketching a thick line on a piece of paper, using a pencil (not an ink pen!):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00212x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>How may the end-to-end electrical resistance of this pencil mark be increased? How may it be decreased? Explain your answers.</p>
<p>The electrical resistance of a pencil mark may be increased by increasing its length. It may be decreased by increasing its width.</p>
<p>Creating a resistor on paper using a pencil is a very easy experiment to perform, the resistance of which may be measured with an ohmmeter. I strongly recommend this as a classroom exercise!</p>
