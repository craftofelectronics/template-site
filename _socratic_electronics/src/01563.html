<p>Does a series LC circuit &quot;appear&quot; capacitive or inductive (from the perspective of the AC source powering it) when the source frequency is greater than the circuitâ€™s resonant frequency? What about a parallel resonant circuit? In each case, explain why.</p>
<p>A series LC circuit will appear <em>inductive</em> when the source frequency exceeds the resonant frequency. A parallel LC circuit will appear <em>capacitive</em> in the same condition.</p>
<p>Ask your students to explain their answers mathematically.</p>
