<p>Shown here is the characteristic curve of a diode:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02019x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Identify which area of this curve represents normal forward-biased operation, and which represents reverse-biased operation. Also, explain the significance of the near-vertical portion of the curve in the lower-left quadrant of the graph.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02019x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Challenge question: identify where the diode’s <em>reverse saturation current</em> may be found on this graph.</p>
<p>Ask your students to identify the region of the curve described by Shockley’s diode equation. The exponential form of that equation really only models one definite portion of the curve!</p>
