<p>Some AC induction motors are equipped with multiple windings so they may operate at two distinct speeds (low speed usually being one-half of high speed). Shown here is the connection diagram for one type of two-speed motor:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03218x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>There are six terminals on the motor itself where the connections are made:</p>

<p>The motorâ€™s datasheet will specify how the connections are to be made. This is typical:</p>
<p><span class="math"></span><span class="math"></span> Explain why the motor runs at half-speed in one connection scheme and full speed in the other. What is going on that makes this possible?</p>
<p>The difference between the two connection schemes is the polarity of three of the coils in relation to the other three. This is called the <em>consequent pole</em> design of two-speed motor, where you essentially double the number of poles in the motor by reconnection.</p>
<p>Consequent pole motors are not the only design with multiple speeds. Sometimes motors are wound with completely separate, multiple windings, which give them any combinations of speeds desired.</p>
