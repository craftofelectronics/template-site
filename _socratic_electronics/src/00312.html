<p>In simple AC power systems, one of the two conductors is typically called the <em>hot</em>, while the other conductor is typically called the <em>neutral</em>. What distinguishes the &quot;hot&quot; conductor from the &quot;neutral&quot; conductor in such a system? In other words, what exactly determines whether a conductor will be called either &quot;hot&quot; or &quot;neutral&quot;?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00312x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The &quot;neutral&quot; conductor in an AC power system is always made electrically common with the earth, while the non-grounded conductor in an AC power system is called the &quot;hot&quot; conductor:</p>

<p>Follow-up question #1: in a power circuit such as this, there is typically a single fuse or circuit breaker for overcurrent protection. Identify the <em>best</em> location to place this fuse or circuit breaker in the circuit.</p>
<p>Follow-up question #2: explain how to use a multimeter to identify the &quot;hot&quot; and &quot;neutral&quot; conductors of a power system such as this.</p>
<p>Ask your students what safety issues surround the &quot;hot&quot; and &quot;neutral&quot; conductors, respectively. What do the names imply about relative hazard, and why is this? Ask them to explain how these safety considerations impact the placement of the overcurrent protection device.</p>
