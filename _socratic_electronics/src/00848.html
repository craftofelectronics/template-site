<p>An <em>operational amplifier</em> is a particular type of <em>differential amplifier</em>. Most op-amps receive two input voltage signals and output one voltage signal:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00848x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Here is a single op-amp, shown under two different conditions (different input voltages). Determine the voltage gain of this op-amp, given the conditions shown:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00848x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00848x03.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Also, write a mathematical formula solving for differential voltage gain (<span class="math"><em>A</em><sub><em>V</em></sub></span>) in terms of an op-amp’s input and output voltages.</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>A</em><sub><em>V</em></sub> = </span> 530,000</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$A_V = {\Delta V_{out} \over \Delta (V_{in2} - V_{in1})}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Follow-up question: convert this voltage gain figure (as a ratio) into a voltage gain figure in decibels.</p>
<p>The calculations for voltage gain here are not that different from the voltage gain calculations for any other amplifier, except that here we’re dealing with a <em>differential</em> amplifier instead of a single-ended amplifier.</p>
<p>A differential voltage gain of 530,000 is not unreasonable for a modern operational amplifier! A gain so extreme may come as a surprise to many students, but they will discover later the utility of such a high gain.</p>
