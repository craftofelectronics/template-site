<p><em>Clamper</em> circuits are sometimes referred to as <em>DC restorer</em> circuits. Explain why.</p>
<p>Does a &quot;clamper&quot; circuit change the shape of a voltage waveform, like a &quot;clipper&quot; circuit does? Explain why or why not.</p>
<p>&quot;Clamper&quot; circuits provide just enough DC bias voltage to offset an AC signal so that almost its entire shape occurs either above or below ground potential.</p>
<p>Ask your students to provide an example of a clamper circuit schematic.</p>
