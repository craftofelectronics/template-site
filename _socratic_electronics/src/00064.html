<p>What is the value of this resistor, in <em>ohms</em> (<span class="math">Ω </span>)?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00064x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Resistor value = 2700 <span class="math">Ω </span>, or 2.7 k<span class="math">Ω </span>.</p>
<p>One format of component value expression popular in Europe is to replace the decimal point with the metric prefix, so 2.7 k<span class="math">Ω </span> would be represented as 2k7 <span class="math">Ω </span>. Not only is this notation simpler, but it also transcends the interpretational difficulties experienced between Europeans and Americans with their opposite usages of commas and decimal points.</p>
<p>Some students might not realize that in Europe, commas are used as decimal points and visa-versa. Thus, two thousand seven hundred would be written as 2,700 in America and 2.700 in Europe. Conversely, the number <span class="math"><em>π</em></span> would be written as 3.141593 in America but 3,141593 in Europe. Confusing? Yes!!</p>
