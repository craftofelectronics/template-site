<p>A popular passive filtering network called the <em>twin-tee</em> is often coupled with an operational amplifier to produce an active filter circuit. Two examples are shown here:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02573x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02573x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Identify which of these circuits is band-pass, and which is band-stop. Also, identify the type of response typically provided by the twin-tee network alone, and how that response is exploited to make <em>two</em> different types of active filter responses.</p>
<p>The first filter shown is a band-stop, while the second filter shown is a band-pass.</p>
<p>Like all the other active filter circuits, the fundamental characteristic of each filter may be determined by qualitative analysis at <span class="math"><em>f</em> = 0</span> and <span class="math"><em>f</em> = ∞</span>.</p>
<p>An interesting concept at work here is the inversion of a function by placement inside the feedback loop of a negative-feedback opamp circuit. What is a band-stop filter all by itself forces the opamp to be a band-pass if placed within the negative feedback signal path. Discuss this very important concept with your students, as this is most definitely not the only application for it!</p>
