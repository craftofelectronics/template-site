<p>Explain the effects of increasing R3’s resistance in this amplifier circuit. As R3 becomes more resistive, will the input signal (<span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>i</em><em>n</em></sub></span>) have more or less effect on the output voltage (<span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>o</em><em>u</em><em>t</em></sub></span>) than before? Express your answer in terms of voltage gain (<span class="math"><em>A</em><sub><em>V</em></sub></span>).</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00958x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>As resistor R3 increases in value, the voltage gain of the amplifier will decrease.</p>
<p>While the answer to this question will be obvious to some, it will not be obvious to all. Ask those students who do understand the answer to explain – using their own words – why the voltage gain decreases as R3’s resistance increases.</p>
<p>Ask your students to imagine two scenarios of extreme resistance change for R3: shorted and open. Qualitative analysis of the circuit should be rather easy given these extreme conditions! Then, ask your students to relate the results of these hypothetical scenarios with a simple increase in resistance. Is there a general problem-solving technique at work here? Challenge your students to explain how this technique works.</p>
