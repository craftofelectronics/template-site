<p>This circuit uses a <em>unijunction transistor</em> (UJT) to latch an LED in the &quot;on&quot; state with a positive pulse at the input terminal. A negative voltage pulse at the input terminal turns the LED off:</p>

<p>Explain how the unijunction transistor functions in this circuit.</p>
<p>Unijunction transistors are hysteretic, like all thyristors. A positive pulse to the emitter terminal latches the UJT, and a negative pulse makes it &quot;drop out&quot;.</p>
<p>Challenge question: what is the purpose of resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>3</sub></span> in this circuit?</p>
<p>Ask your students to identify the terminals on the UJT. The designations for each terminal may be surprising to your students, given the names of bipolar transistor terminals!</p>
<p>The challenge question may only be answered if one carefully considers the characteristics of an LED. Resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>3</sub></span> helps overcome problems that might potentially arise due to the nonlinearities of the diode in its off state.</p>
<p>I got this circuit from the October 2003 issue of magazine, in their regular &quot;Circuit Ideas&quot; section. The design is attributed to André de Guérin.</p>
