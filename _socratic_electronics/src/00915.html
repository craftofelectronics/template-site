<p>Transistor operation may be explained in terms of three different currents: <em>injection</em>, <em>diffusion</em>, and <em>collection</em>. Describe what each of these currents are, and how they help explain the amplifying nature of a transistor.</p>
<p>&quot;Injection&quot; current consists of those majority charge carriers (either electrons or holes, depending on the transistor type) that are &quot;injected&quot; from the emitter region into the base region of a transistor. &quot;Diffusion&quot; current is the current through the base terminal of the transistor resulting from recombination of electrons and holes in the emitter-base junction. Most of the injection current, however, becomes &quot;collection&quot; current and goes through the collector terminal of the transistor.</p>
<p>As students research and use these terms in their study of bipolar junction transistors, the theory of BJT operation should become more evident. The terms really are well-chosen, accurately representing the motions of charge carriers within the transistor structure.</p>
<p>The base is doped much lighter than the emitter so that the collection current will greatly exceed the diffusion current. If the two layers were equally doped, the base-emitter junction would tend to act as a normal diode, passing nearly all the injection current through the base terminal. As it is, only a small portion of the injected charge carriers diffuse into the base, the rest being “collected” by the collector layer.</p>
<p>The collector is not as heavily doped as the emitter, in order that the collector-base junction will have a greater reverse breakdown voltage. Since this junction typically operates in reverse-bias mode with a substantial voltage drop, the breakdown voltage rating is important.</p>
