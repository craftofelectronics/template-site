<p>Suppose two 33 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>F capacitors are connected in series with each other. What will their combined capacitance be, in Farads? Explain your answer.</p>
<p>16.5 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>F</p>
<p>Capacitors often confuse new students of electronics because their values do not add up the same as resistors. It is important in answering this question that your students understand <em>why</em> series capacitances combine as they do. There is more than one way to explain this phenomenon – explain in terms of capacitor dimensions, or in terms of voltage drop and charge storage.</p>
