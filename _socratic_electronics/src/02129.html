<p>In this circuit, the values of capacitor <span class="math"><em>C</em><sub>1</sub></span> and resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> are chosen to provide a short time constant, so they act as a differentiator network. This results in a brief pulse of voltage across <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> at each leading edge of the square wave input. Capacitor <span class="math"><em>C</em><sub>2</sub></span> and resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span> are sized to provide a long time constant, so as to form an integrator network. This time-averages the brief pulses into a final DC output voltage relatively free of ripple.</p>

<p>Explain what happens to the output voltage as the input frequency is increased, assuming the input voltage amplitude does not change. Can you think of any practical applications for a circuit such as this?</p>
<p>The DC output voltage will increase as the input signal frequency is increased. This lends itself to frequency measurement applications.</p>
<p>Do not accept an answer from students along the lines of &quot;frequency measurement.&quot; Ask them to provide some <em>practical</em> examples of systems where frequency measurement is important. If they have difficulty thinking of anything practical, suggest that the input (square wave) signal might come from a sensor detecting shaft rotation (one pulse per revolution), then ask them to think of possible applications for a circuit such as this.</p>
