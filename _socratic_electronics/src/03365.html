<p>If a variable resistor is adjusted so that its resistance increases (more ohms), while the voltage dropped across it remains constant, what will happen to the current through the resistor? Will the current <em>increase</em>, will it <em>decrease</em>, or will it <em>remain unchanged</em>?</p>
<p>If <span class="math"><em>R</em></span> increases while <span class="math"><em>E</em></span> remains constant, <span class="math"><em>I</em></span> must <em>decrease</em>.</p>
