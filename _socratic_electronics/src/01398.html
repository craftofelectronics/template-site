<p>Complete a timing diagram for this synchronous counter circuit, and identify the direction of its binary count:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01398x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01398x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>This circuit counts <em>down</em>:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01398x03.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Discuss with your students how to relate timing diagrams to binary counts (as shown in the answer).</p>
