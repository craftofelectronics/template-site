<p>Determine the <em>modulus</em> (MOD) of a four-bit binary counter. Determine the modulus of two four-bit binary counters cascaded to make an eight-bit binary counter.</p>
<p>Four bit counter modulus = 16.</p>
<p>Eight bit counter modulus = 256.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: is it possible for a four-bit counter to have a modulus equal to some value other than 16? Give an example!</p>
<p>The real purpose of this question is to get students to find out what term &quot;modulus&quot; means, and how it relates to counter bits.</p>
