<p>A 470 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>F capacitor begins in a charged state of 270 volts, and discharges through a 100 k<span class="math">Ω </span> resistor. How long will it take before the capacitor’s voltage will fall to a relatively safe value (30 volts or less)?</p>
<p>It will take 103.3 seconds for the voltage to fall to 30 volts.</p>
<p>This question incorporates electrical safety into an RC circuit time calculation. Safety is something you should periodically revisit with your students, because it is so important. Ask your students how a &quot;safe&quot; value of voltage may be determined, and if there are any environmental circumstances impacting this determination.</p>
