<p>This vocal eliminator circuit used to work just fine, but then one day it seemed to lose a lot of its bass. It still did its job of eliminating the vocal track, but instead of hearing the full range of musical tones it only reproduced the high frequencies, while the low frequency tones were lost:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03796x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Identify the following fault possibilities:</p>
<p>One resistor failure (either open or shorted) that could cause this to happen:</p>
<p>One capacitor failure (either open or shorted) that could cause this to happen:</p>
<p>One opamp failure that could cause this to happen:</p>
<p>For each of these proposed faults, explain <em>why</em> the bass tones would be lost.</p>
<p>Please note that the following list is not exhaustive. That is, other component faults may be possible!</p>
<p>One resistor failure (either open or shorted) that could cause this to happen: <em><span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>8</sub></span> failed open.</em></p>
<p>One capacitor failure (either open or shorted) that could cause this to happen: <em><span class="math"><em>C</em><sub>2</sub></span> failed shorted.</em></p>
<p>One opamp failure that could cause this to happen: <em><span class="math"><em>U</em><sub>4</sub></span> failed.</em></p>
<p>Ask your students to explain how they identified their proposed faults, and also how they were able to identify component that <em>must</em> still be working properly.</p>
