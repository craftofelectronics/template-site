<p>Faraday’s Law of electromagnetic induction states that the induced voltage across a coil of wire is equal to the number of &quot;turns&quot; in the coil multiplied by the rate of change of magnetic flux over time:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$v = N{d\phi \over dt}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Often you will see a negative sign preceding the right-hand side of the equation, to properly denote polarity of the induced voltage. This is the mathematical expression of <em>Lenz’s Law</em>. In this equation, though, the negative sign is omitted and we pay attention only to the absolute value of induced voltage.</p>
<p>Use calculus techniques to express <span class="math"><em>ϕ</em></span> as a function of <span class="math"><em>v</em></span>, so that we may have an equation useful for predicting the amount of magnetic flux accumulated in an inductor or transformer given the voltage across it (<span class="math"><em>v</em></span>) and the time of the accumulation (<span class="math"><em>T</em></span>). Hint: you may treat this as a differential equation with separable variables.</p>
<p>For those who are unfamiliar with calculus, you may still answer this question, albeit in a simpler form: write an equation describing the change in magnetic flux within a coil (<span class="math">Δ Φ </span>) given a constant DC voltage across the coil (<span class="math"><em>V</em></span>) and a certain amount of time (<span class="math"><em>t</em></span>).</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\phi = {1 \over N} \int_0^T v \&gt; dt$</span><br /></p>
<p>If the voltage is constant (<span class="math"><em>V</em></span>), the change in flux may be calculated by this simple equation:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\Delta \Phi = {{V t} \over N}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Even if students are not familiar with differential equations at all, they should be able to arrive at the second (algebraic) equation if they properly understand how flux rate-of-change relates to induced voltage.</p>
