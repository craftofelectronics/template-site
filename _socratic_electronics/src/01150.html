<p>Find one or two real resistors and bring them with you to class for discussion. Identify as much information as you can about your resistors prior to discussion:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Resistance (ideal)</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Resistance (actual)</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Power rating</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Type (carbon composition, metal film, wire-wound, etc.)</p>
<p>If possible, find a manufacturer’s datasheet for your components (or at least a datasheet for a similar component) to discuss with your classmates.</p>
<p>Be prepared to <em>prove</em> the actual resistance of your resistors in class, by using a multimeter!</p>
<p>The purpose of this question is to get students to kinesthetically interact with the subject matter. It may seem silly to have students engage in a &quot;show and tell&quot; exercise, but I have found that activities such as this greatly help some students. For those learners who are kinesthetic in nature, it is a great help to actually <em>touch</em> real components while they’re learning about their function. Of course, this question also provides an excellent opportunity for them to practice interpreting color codes and/or component markings, use a multimeter, access datasheets, etc.</p>
