<p>Complete this table of values for inductor voltage and current. Consider time = 0 to be the precise moment the switch closes:</p>

<p><span class="math"></span><br /><span class="math">$\underbar{file 01815}$</span><br /><span class="math"></span></p>
<p>This circuit demands careful pre-analysis of the initial and final values. If students experience difficulty calculating the voltage and current figures here, it is probably due to incorrect initial and final values for voltage and/or current.</p>
