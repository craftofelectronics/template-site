<p>An engineer needs to calculate the values of two resistors to set the minimum and maximum resistance ratios for the following potentiometer circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02769x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>First, write an equation for each circuit, showing how resistances <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span>, <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span>, and the 10 k<span class="math">Ω </span> of the potentiometer combine to form the ratio <span class="math">$a \over b$</span>. Then, use techniques for solving simultaneous equations to calculate actual resistance values for <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span>.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">${a \over b} \hbox{ (minimum)} = {R_1 \over {R_2 + 10000}} \hbox{\hskip 50pt} {a \over b} \hbox{ (maximum)} = {{R_1 + 10000 }\over R_2}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> = 15.77 k<span class="math">Ω </span></p>
<p><span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span> = 515.5 <span class="math">Ω </span></p>
<p>This very practical application of simultaneous equations was actually used by one of my students in establishing the lower and upper bounds for the voltage gain adjustment of an inverting opamp circuit!</p>
