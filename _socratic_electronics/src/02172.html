<p>A generator is coupled to a bicycle mechanism, so that a person can generate their own electricity:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02172x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The person pedaling this bicycle/generator notices that it becomes more difficult to pedal when the generator is connected to a load such as a light bulb, or when it is charging a battery. When the generator is open-circuited, however, it is very easy to spin. Explain why this is, in terms of <em>work</em> and energy transfer.</p>
<p>The energy consumed by the load must be supplied by whatever mechanical source turns the generator. In this case, the source is the human being pedaling the bicycle.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: what would it mean if a generator required no physical effort to turn while it was powering an electrical load?</p>
<p>Discuss how the Law of Energy Conservation relates to this scenario.</p>
