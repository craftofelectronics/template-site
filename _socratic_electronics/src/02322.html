<p>The typical amount of current through a JFET gate terminal is far less than the typical amount of current through a BJT base terminal, for similar controlled currents (drain or collector, respectively). Explain what it is about the construction and/or use of the JFET that limits the input current to almost nothing during normal operation.</p>
<p>The gate-source PN junction is reverse-biased.</p>
<p>If need be, refer back to a &quot;cut-away&quot; diagram of a JFET to help your students understand why the input impedance of a JFET is what it is.</p>
