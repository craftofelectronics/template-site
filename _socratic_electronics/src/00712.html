<p>The relationship between voltage and current for a PN junction is described by this equation, sometimes referred to as the &quot;diode equation,&quot; or &quot;Shockley’s diode equation&quot; after its discoverer:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$I_D = I_S (e^{qV_D \over NkT} - 1)$</span><br /></p>
<p>Where,</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>I</em><sub><em>D</em></sub> = </span> Current through the PN junction, in amps</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>I</em><sub><em>S</em></sub> = </span> PN junction saturation current, in amps (typically 1 picoamp)</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>e</em> = </span> Euler’s number <span class="math"> ≈ </span> 2.718281828</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>q</em> = </span> Electron unit charge, <span class="math">1. 6 × 10<sup> − 19</sup></span> coulombs</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>D</em></sub> = </span> Voltage across the PN junction, in volts</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>N</em> = </span> Nonideality coefficient, or emission coefficient (typically between 1 and 2)</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>k</em> = </span> Boltzmann’s constant, <span class="math">1. 38 × 10<sup> − 23</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="math"><em>T</em> = </span> Junction temperature, degrees Kelvin</p>
<p>At first this equation may seem very daunting, until you realize that there are really only three variables in it: <span class="math"><em>I</em><sub><em>D</em></sub></span>, <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>D</em></sub></span>, and <span class="math"><em>T</em></span>. All the other terms are constants. Since in most cases we assume temperature is fairly constant as well, we are really only dealing with two variables: diode current and diode voltage. Based on this realization, re-write the equation as a proportionality rather than an equality, showing how the two variables of diode current and voltage relate:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$I_D \propto \hbox{ . . .}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Based on this simplified equation, what would an I/V graph for a PN junction look like? How does this graph compare against the I/V graph for a resistor?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00712x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Simplified proportionality:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math"><em>I</em><sub><em>D</em></sub> ∝ <em>e</em><sup><em>V</em><sub><em>D</em></sub></sup></span><br /></p>
<p>The graph described by the &quot;diode formula&quot; is a standard exponential curve, rising sharply as the independent variable (<span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>D</em></sub></span>, in this case) increases. The corresponding graph for a resistor, of course, is linear.</p>
<p>Ask your students to sketch their own renditions of an exponential curve on the whiteboard for all to see. Don’t just let them get away with parroting the answer: &quot;It’s an exponential curve.&quot;</p>
