<p>A trend in CMOS logic gate development is toward lower and lower operating voltages. The &quot;AUC&quot; family of CMOS logic, for example, is able to operate at less than 2 volts <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>D</em><em>D</em></sub></span>!</p>
<p>Explain why this is a trend in modern logic circuit design. What benefits result from lower operating voltages? What possible disadvantages also result?</p>
<p>Lower operating voltages result in less power dissipation. However, noise margins become &quot;tighter&quot; under the same conditions, which is a disadvantage.</p>
<p>Discuss this trend with your students, citing examples from industry literature if possible. Be sure to ask your students <em>why</em> lower operating voltages reduces power dissipation (with reference to Jouleâ€™s Law, please!), and also why this reduces noise margins.</p>
