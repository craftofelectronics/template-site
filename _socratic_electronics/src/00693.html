<p>Suppose we have a single resistor powered by two parallel-connected current sources. Each of the current sources is &quot;ideal,&quot; possessing infinite internal resistance:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00693x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Calculate the resistor’s voltage drop and current in this circuit.</p>
<p>Now, suppose we were to remove one current source from the circuit, replacing it with its internal resistance (<span class="math">∞</span> <span class="math">Ω </span>). Re-calculate the resistor’s voltage drop and current in the resulting circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00693x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Now, suppose we were to remove the other current source from the circuit, replacing it with its internal resistance (<span class="math">∞</span> <span class="math">Ω </span>). Re-calculate the resistor’s voltage drop and current in the resulting circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00693x03.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>One last exercise: &quot;superimpose&quot; (add) the resistor voltages and superimpose (add) the resistor currents in the last two circuit examples, and compare these voltage and current figures with the calculated values of the original circuit. What do you notice?</p>
<p>Original circuit: <span class="math"><em>E</em><sub><em>R</em></sub> = </span> 15 volts ; <span class="math"><em>I</em><sub><em>R</em></sub> = </span> 3 A</p>
<p>With 7 amp current source only: <span class="math"><em>E</em><sub><em>R</em></sub> = </span> 35 volts ; <span class="math"><em>I</em><sub><em>R</em></sub> = </span> 7 A</p>
<p>With 4 amp current source only: <span class="math"><em>E</em><sub><em>R</em></sub> = </span> 20 volts ; <span class="math"><em>I</em><sub><em>R</em></sub> = </span> 4 A</p>
<p>35 volts - 20 volts = 15 volts</p>
<p>7 A - 4 A = 3 A</p>
<p>This circuit is so simple, students should not even require the use of a calculator to determine the current figures. If students are not familiar with current sources, this question provides an excellent opportunity to review them. The main point of the question is, however, to get students to see the concept of <em>superposition</em> of voltages and currents.</p>
