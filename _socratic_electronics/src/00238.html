<p>What is generally considered to be the maximum number of individual wires that may be attached to a single terminal on a terminal block?</p>
<p>Two wires per fastener, maximum:</p>

<p>Iâ€™m not sure if there is a specific code or regulation governing the number of terminals connected to a terminal block, but the &quot;no more than two wires per lug&quot; rule makes good sense. That is, of course, unless two conductors stuffed in the same hole would exceed the maximum cross-sectional area limit of the block, then &quot;no more than one wire&quot; is the rule.</p>
<p>I have had the misfortune of seeing egregious violations of both rules in my work experience!</p>
