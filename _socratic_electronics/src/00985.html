<p>Suppose a very important piece of electronic equipment (nuclear reactor shutdown controls, for instance) needed to be supplied with <em>uninterruptible</em> DC power. For reliabilityâ€™s sake, this circuit gets its power from three (redundant) DC voltage sources:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00985x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The only problem with this scenario is the possibility of one of these power sources internally short-circuiting. Describe what would happen if one of the three DC power sources developed an internal short-circuit, and explain how this problem could be avoided by placing diodes in the circuit.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00985x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Challenge question: it would be nice if there were indicator lamps in the system to warn maintenance personnel of a shorted power supply. Is there any way you can think of to place light bulbs in this system somewhere, so that one will light up in the event of a power supply failure?</p>
<p>Discuss both the nature of the problem, and of the solution, with your students. Why does the proposed solution work to eliminate power failure in the event of a short-circuit internal to one of the power sources?</p>
