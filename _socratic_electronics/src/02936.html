<p>Determine what input conditions are necessary to set, reset, and toggle these two J-K flip-flops:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02936x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>For the J-K flip-flop with active-high inputs:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Set by . . .</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Reset by . . .</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Toggle by . . .</p>
<p>For the J-K flip-flop with active-low inputs:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Set by . . .</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Reset by . . .</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Toggle by . . .</p>
<p>In <em>either</em> case, you cause the flip-flop to go into these three modes by doing the following:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Set by <em>activating</em> <span class="math"><em>J</em></span>, <em>deactivating</em> <span class="math"><em>K</em></span>, and <em>clocking</em> <span class="math"><em>C</em></span>.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Reset by <em>activating</em> <span class="math"><em>K</em></span>, <em>deactivating</em> <span class="math"><em>J</em></span>, and <em>clocking</em> <span class="math"><em>C</em></span>.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Toggle by <em>activating</em> <span class="math"><em>J</em></span> and <span class="math"><em>K</em></span> simultaneously, and <em>clocking</em> <span class="math"><em>C</em></span>.</p>
<p>Specifically, though, here is what you would need to do to each flip-flop, stated in terms of &quot;high&quot; and &quot;low&quot; logic states:</p>
<p>For the J-K flip-flop with active-high inputs:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Set by making <span class="math"><em>J</em></span> high, <span class="math"><em>K</em></span> low, and <span class="math"><em>C</em></span> transition from low to high.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Reset by making <span class="math"><em>K</em></span> high, <span class="math"><em>J</em></span> low, and <span class="math"><em>C</em></span> transition from low to high.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Toggle by making <span class="math"><em>J</em></span> high, <span class="math"><em>K</em></span> high, and <span class="math"><em>C</em></span> transition from low to high.</p>
<p>For the J-K flip-flop with active-low inputs:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Set by making <span class="math"><em>K</em></span> high, <span class="math"><em>J</em></span> low, and <span class="math"><em>C</em></span> transition from high to low.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Reset by making <span class="math"><em>J</em></span> high, <span class="math"><em>K</em></span> low, and <span class="math"><em>C</em></span> transition from high to low.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Toggle by making <span class="math"><em>J</em></span> low, <span class="math"><em>K</em></span> low, and <span class="math"><em>C</em></span> transition from high to low.</p>
<p>This question reviews the basic modes of J-K flip-flops, as well as the significance of active-low inputs.</p>
