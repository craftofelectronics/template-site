<p>How much resistance must a heating element possess in order to dissipate 3 kW of power at 240 VAC? How much resistance must a heating element possess in order to dissipate the same amount of power (3 kW) at half the voltage (120 VAC)?</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>240<em>V</em></sub></span> = 19.2 <span class="math">Ω </span></p>
<p><span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>120<em>V</em></sub></span> = 4.8 <span class="math">Ω </span></p>
<p>This question is an exercise in algebraic manipulation. Sure, students will be able to find an equation solving for resistance in terms of power and voltage, but for the sake of algebra practice they should be asked to derive the equation from a more common power equation, such as <span class="math">$P = {E^2 \over R}$</span>.</p>
