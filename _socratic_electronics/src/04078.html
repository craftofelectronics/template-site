<p>Label the directions of both electron flow and conventional flow in this simple circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{04078x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{04078x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>In case anyone asks, the little circles with the letter &quot;e&quot; inside are supposed to represent electrons. Kind of silly, I know, but I was looking for some way of clearly distinguishing one direction from the other without just relying on the text labels.</p>
