<p>Given the following test circuit, with an oscilloscope used to record <em>current</em> from the battery to the cable (measuring voltage dropped across a shunt resistor), what sort of waveform or pulse would the oscilloscope register after switch closure?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00130x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The oscilloscope would register a square-edged pulse of voltage approximately equal to 480 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>V, which of course corresponds to a current of approximately 480 mA:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00130x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The pulse duration should range somewhere between 162.67 microseconds and 170.42 microseconds (based on two different figures I obtained for RG-58/U cable velocity factors).</p>
<p>Answering this question requires several steps, and the combining of multiple concepts. It should be apparent from the answer that Ohm’s Law (<span class="math">$I = {E \over R}$</span>) is sufficient for calculating pulse current, but the time delay figure given in the answer may confuse some students. For those students who calculate a time figure that is half as much as the one given in the answer, encourage them to think of why their (incorrect) answer might have been off by 50%. The existence of a 2:1 ratio such as this implies a simple conceptual misunderstanding.</p>
<p>For the RG-58/U cable velocity factor, I obtained two different figures: 0.63 and 0.66, which accounts for the two time delay answers given.</p>
