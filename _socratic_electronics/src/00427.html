<p>Identify the primary-secondary connection configuration of these pole-mounted power transformers (i.e. Y-Y, Y-Delta, Delta-Y, etc.):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00427x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>These transformers are connected in an <em>open-Delta</em> configuration.</p>
<p>Understanding the open-Delta configuration is made easier if students first understand the robustness of the regular Delta configuration: how it continues to provide true three-phase power with no degradation in line voltage in the event of a winding failure. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of such a configuration with your students.</p>
