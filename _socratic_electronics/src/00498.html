<p>Determine the total voltage in each of these examples, drawing a phasor diagram to show how the total (resultant) voltage geometrically relates to the source voltages in each scenario:</p>

<p>At first it may confuse students to use polarity marks (+ and -) for AC voltages. After all, doesnâ€™t the polarity of AC <em>alternate</em> back and forth, so as to be continuously changing? However, when analyzing AC circuits, polarity marks are essential for giving a frame of reference to phasor voltages, which like all voltages are measured <em>between two points</em>, and thus may be measured two different ways.</p>
