<p>In this series-parallel circuit, resistors R1 and R2 are in series with each other, but resistor R3 is neither in series nor in parallel with either R1 or R2:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01755x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Normally, the first step in mathematically analyzing a circuit such as this is to determine the total circuit resistance. In other words, we need to calculate how much resistance the voltage source &quot;sees&quot; in the network formed by R1, R2, and R3. If the circuit were a simple series configuration, our task would be easy:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01755x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Likewise, if the circuit were a simple parallel configuration, we would have no difficulty at all calculating total resistance:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01755x03.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Due to the fact that our given circuit is neither purely series nor purely parallel, though, calculation of total resistance is not a simple one-step operation. However, there is a way we could simplify the circuit to something that <em>is</em> either simple series or simple parallel. Describe how that might be done, and demonstrate using numerical values for resistors R1, R2, and R3.</p>
<p>Suppose we had these resistor values:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> R1 = 3000 <span class="math">Ω </span></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> R2 = 2000 <span class="math">Ω </span></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> R3 = 5000 <span class="math">Ω </span></p>
<p>The total resistance in this case would be 2500 <span class="math">Ω </span>. I’ll let you figure out how to do this!</p>
<p><em>Hint: 2.5k is exactly one-half of 5k</em></p>
<p>Figuring out how to calculate total resistance in a series-parallel network is an exercise in problem-solving. Students must determine how to convert a complex problem into multiple, simpler problems which they can then solve with the tools they have.</p>
<p>This sort of exercise is also helpful in getting students to think in terms of <em>incremental</em> problem-solving. Being able to take sections of a circuit and reduce them to equivalent component values so that the circuit becomes simpler and simpler to analyze is a very important skill in electronics.</p>
