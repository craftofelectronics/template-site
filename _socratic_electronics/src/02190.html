<p>An inductive AC load consumes 15.2 MW of true power at a voltage of 115 kV and 149.8 amps. If the system frequency is 50 Hz, calculate the following:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Apparent power (<span class="math"><em>S</em></span>) =</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Reactive power (<span class="math"><em>Q</em></span>) =</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Power factor =</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math">Θ </span> =</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Necessary parallel <span class="math"><em>C</em></span> size to correct power factor to unity =</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Apparent power (<span class="math"><em>S</em></span>) = 17.23 MVA</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Reactive power (<span class="math"><em>Q</em></span>) = 8.107 MVAR</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Power factor = 0.882</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math">Θ </span> = 28.1<span class="math">$^{o}$</span></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Necessary parallel <span class="math"><em>C</em></span> size to correct power factor to unity = 1.951 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>F</p>
<p>There are multiple methods of solution for this problem, so be sure to have your students present their thoughts and strategies during discussion!</p>
