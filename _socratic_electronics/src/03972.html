<p>What types of transistors are used inside &quot;CMOS&quot; style logic gate integrated circuits, as opposed to &quot;TTL&quot; logic gate integrated circuits?</p>
<p>CMOS gate circuits are made from insulated-gate field-effect transistors (IGFETs or MOSFETs), both N-channel and P-channel, all E-type (enhancement-type, not depletion-type).</p>
