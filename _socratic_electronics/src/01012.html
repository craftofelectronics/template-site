<p>Practical integrator circuits must have a <em>compensating resistor</em> connected in parallel with the capacitor, in the feedback loop. Typically, this resistor value is very large: about 100 times as large as <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>i</em><em>n</em></sub></span>.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01012x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Describe why this is a necessity for accurate integration. Hint: an ideal opamp would not need this resistor!</p>
<p>This compensation resistor helps offset errors otherwise incurred by the opamp’s <em>bias current</em> on the inverting input.</p>
<p>Discuss where bias currents originate from in the opamp’s internal circuitry, and ask your students if they have any recommendations on specific opamp types that minimize bias current.</p>
