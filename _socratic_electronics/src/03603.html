<p>A digital computer network uses a two-conductor cable to send both power (DC) and data (AC pulses) from one computer to another, inductors and capacitors being used to filter the voltages to and from their proper destinations:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03603x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The system works fine for a while, but then one day the receiving computer stops receiving data. It still has DC power getting to it, but just no digital data. Identify the following:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> failed component in the circuit that could possibly account for the problem, and the type of fault (open or short) you suspect that component would have.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Show where you would connect a voltmeter in the circuit to verify a fault in that one suspect component, and the voltage reading (AC, DC, or both) you would expect to get if indeed that one component had failed.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Source <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub>1</sub></span> failed (no signal); measure 0 AC voltage directly across its terminals.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Problem with receiving computer circuitry (digital data load &quot;resistor&quot; failed open); measure full AC voltage directly across its terminals.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Capacitor <span class="math"><em>C</em><sub>1</sub></span> failed open; measure full AC voltage directly across its terminals.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Capacitor <span class="math"><em>C</em><sub>2</sub></span> failed open; measure full AC voltage directly across its terminals.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Capacitor <span class="math"><em>C</em><sub>3</sub></span> failed open; measure full AC voltage directly across its terminals.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Capacitor <span class="math"><em>C</em><sub>4</sub></span> failed open; measure full AC voltage directly across its terminals.</p>
