<p>Define &quot;Unity-Gain Bandwidth&quot; (<span class="math"><em>B</em><sub>1</sub></span>) as the term applies to operational amplifiers.</p>
<p>Unity-Gain Bandwidth is the frequency at which an operational amplifierâ€™s open-loop voltage gain is equal to 1.</p>
<p>It does not require a great deal of insight to recognize that unity-gain bandwidth (<span class="math"><em>B</em><sub>1</sub></span>) and gain-bandwidth product (GBW) are pretty much the same thing. This would be a good point to bring up (in the form of a question!) for your students if you have already discussed GBW.</p>
