<p>There is a special type of diode called a <em>varactor</em>, which is used to create a voltage-dependent capacitance. This function is often used in electronic radio tuner circuits:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01386x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The voltage-dependent capacitance of this diode is given by the following equation:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$C_j = {C_o \over {\sqrt{2V + 1}}}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Where,</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>C</em><sub><em>J</em></sub> = </span> Junction capacitance</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>C</em><sub><em>o</em></sub> = </span> Junction capacitance with no applied voltage</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>V</em> = </span> Applied reverse junction voltage</p>
<p>Based on this equation, would you say that capacitance is <em>directly</em> or <em>inversely</em> related to the applied reverse-bias voltage of a varactor diode? Based on what you know of diode theory, explain why this makes sense.</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>C</em><sub><em>j</em></sub></span> is inversely related to <span class="math"><em>V</em></span> for a varactor diode.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: substitute the varactor diode capacitance equation into the standard resonant frequency equation to arrive at one equation solving for frequency in terms of <span class="math"><em>L</em></span> and diode voltage <span class="math"><em>V</em></span>.</p>
<p>This question reinforces students’ understanding of the mathematical terms <em>direct</em> and <em>inverse</em>, as well as review basic PN junction theory and capacitor theory.</p>
