<p>It is fairly important to use large value resistors (10 M<span class="math">Ω </span> works well) for resistors <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span>, as well as a comparator with high input impedance (a TL08x operational amplifier with JFET inputs is fine). Explain why.</p>
<p>The (internal) Thévenin equivalent resistance for the LED light sensor is quite high, making it sensitive to loading.</p>
<p>Nothing to note here.</p>
