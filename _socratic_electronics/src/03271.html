<p>Calculate both the total resistance of this voltage divider circuit (as &quot;seen&quot; from the perspective of the 25 volt source) and its output voltage (as measured from the <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>o</em><em>u</em><em>t</em></sub></span> terminal to ground):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03271x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Note that the upper 5 k<span class="math">Ω </span> potentiometer is set to its 20% position (<span class="math"><em>m</em> = 0. 2</span>), while the lower 5 k<span class="math">Ω </span> potentiometer is set to its 90% position (<span class="math"><em>m</em> = 0. 9</span>), and the 100 k<span class="math">Ω </span> potentiometer is set to its 40% position (<span class="math"><em>m</em> = 0. 4</span>).</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>t</em><em>o</em><em>t</em><em>a</em><em>l</em></sub></span> = 9.978 k<span class="math">Ω </span></p>
<p><span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>o</em><em>u</em><em>t</em></sub></span> = 12.756 V</p>
<p>Ask your students to explain why the output voltage is expressed as a positive quantity. Is this significant, or could it be properly expressed as a negative quantity as well? In other words, is this an <em>absolute value</em> of a voltage which may be negative, or is it definitely a positive voltage? How may we tell?</p>
<p>Also, it might be good to ask your students to show the equivalent circuit (made up entirely of fixed resistors) that they drew in route to solving for total resistance and output voltage. Encourage them to take this step if they have not already, for although it does involve &quot;extra&quot; work, it helps greatly in keeping track of the series-parallel relationships and all calculated circuit values.</p>
