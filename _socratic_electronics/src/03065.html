<p>The following schematic diagram is for a <em>two-input selector</em> circuit, which (as the name implies) selects one of two inputs to be sent to the output:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03065x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Determine what state the &quot;select control&quot; input line has to be in to select Input<span class="math">$_{A}$</span> to be sent to the output, and what state it has to be in to select Input<span class="math">$_{B}$</span> to go to the output.</p>
<p>A high signal on the &quot;select control&quot; line selects Input<span class="math">$_{A}$</span>, while a low signal on that same line selects Input<span class="math">$_{B}$</span>.</p>
<p>Selector circuits are widely used internally in counter and shift register circuits where digital signals must be selected from multiple sources to achieve certain functions. Be sure your students understand how it works, for they will surely see it later in some application!</p>
