<p>All electrical soldering, and most other forms of soldering as well, requires the addition of a substance known as <em>flux</em>. What is the purpose of adding &quot;flux&quot; to the soldering process, and what type of flux is typically used for electrical soldering?</p>
<p>&quot;Flux&quot; is a substance that chemically cleans the metal surfaces prior to soldering. For electrical work, the preferred flux is &quot;rosin&quot;.</p>
<p>This question, and the corresponding answer, point to one of the fundamental requirements for a good solder joint: clean metal surfaces. Flux is designed to chemically clean the joint prior to and during the soldering process, but it is no substitute for proper preparatory cleaning beforehand.</p>
<p>Discuss this point with your students. If possible, set up some wire connections to be soldered, and show the effects of a small amount of oil or grease on a solder joint (even when using flux).</p>
