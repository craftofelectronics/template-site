<p>Suppose you need to power a 120 volt, 600 watt heating element from a 240 volt source. You happen to have several 240V/120V step-down transformers on hand, but each one is only rated at 400 VA. Draw a schematic diagram showing how multiple transformers could be used to match the 120 volt load to the 240 volt source.</p>

<p>In case you students have not yet studied AC power (watts, volt-amps, and volt-amps reactive), let them determine what &quot;VA&quot; means first, and then let them know it is simply equivalent to &quot;watts&quot; for a resistive load.</p>
<p>It is a very realistic problem to have to match available components to a particular task, so this question is worth your studentsâ€™ while to discuss and understand thoroughly.</p>
