<p>Assume that the switch in this circuit is toggled (switched positions) once every 5 seconds, beginning in the &quot;up&quot; (charge) position at time <span class="math"><em>t</em> = 0</span>, and that the capacitor begins in a fully discharged state at that time. Determine the capacitor voltage at each switch toggle:</p>

<p>Be sure to have your students share their problem-solving techniques (how they determined which equation to use, etc.) in class. See how many of them notice that the exponential portion of the equation (<span class="math">$e^{t \over \tau}$</span>) is the same for each calculation, and if they find an easy way to manage the calculations by storing charge/discharge percentages in their calculator memories!</p>
