<p>Calculate the voltmeter voltage in each of these circuits, assuming the wiper position is 25% up from the bottom:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00342x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Voltmeter in left-hand circuit = 2.25 volts</p>
<p>Voltmeter in right-hand circuit = 2.13 volts</p>
<p>Challenge your students to explain the significance of the reduced voltage from the potentiometer in the presence of a load (the 3.3 k<span class="math">Ω </span> resistor). What impact could this effect have on a circuit we might build, where we expect the potentiometer to output a certain voltage corresponding to a specific wiper position?</p>
