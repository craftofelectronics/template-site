<p>A <em>differential</em> relay is a common type of protective relay used in power systems. One of the more common forms is the differential current relay. A very common example of a differential current relay – so common, in fact, that nearly every house is equipped with at least one – is the <em>GFCI</em>, or <em>Ground Fault Current Interrupter</em>. Explain what a GFCI is, and then in a larger context, explain what a differential relay protects against.</p>
<p>The function of a GFCI is very easy to research, so I’ll leave that to you. In a more general sense, a <em>differential relay</em> protects against conditions where two or more electrical quantities (usually current) are not in phasor balance. That is, a differential relay will trip when two or more electrical quantities do not precisely balance one another when they should.</p>
<p>This question affords students the opportunity to relate something they probably never have had exposure to (a differential protective relay) to something they may see every day (a GFCI-protected power receptacle). The purpose of this comparison, of course, is to give students a familiar context in which to understand something new.</p>
