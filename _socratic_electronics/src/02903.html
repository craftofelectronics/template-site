<p>As an instructor, how to you help students develop the ability to monitor their own learning? What specific tools do you use to teach metacognitive skills?</p>
<p>If you are at a loss for an answer here, try some of these suggestions:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Resist the temptation to provide immediate answers to students’ questions. Silence is an underrated teaching tool – return the question to the student in the form of an easier question, giving them time to think it over and to respond.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Have your students regularly share their problem-solving strategies in class so you and their peers can see what’s going on inside their heads.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Give specific assignments that ask students to document the steps necessary to solve a problem, rather than merely asking them to provide an answer.</p>
<p>The purpose of this question is to get instructors to think about how they teach students to think about thinking. So, I suppose you could call this a meta-meta-cognitive question.</p>
