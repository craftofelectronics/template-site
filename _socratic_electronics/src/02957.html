<p>Use circuit simulation software to verify your predicted and actual truth tables.</p>
<p>Students are to research the datasheet for their particular IC and figure out from that what connections and timing sequences they need to make the circuit perform as requested. It is very important for students to learn to interpret manufacturersâ€™ datasheets!</p>
<p>I recommend a slow clock frequency (1 Hz or so) to allow for easy viewing of the count sequence.</p>
