<p>Most modern analog oscilloscopes have the ability to display multiple traces on their screens (dual-trace is the standard), even though the CRT itself used by the ’scope may only have one electron gun, and thus only be able to &quot;paint&quot; one flying dot on the screen at a time.</p>
<p>Oscilloscopes with single-gun display tubes achieve dual-trace capability by way of <em>multiplexing</em> the two input channels to the same CRT. There are usually two different modes for this multiplexing, though: <strong>alternate</strong> and <strong>chop</strong>.</p>
<p>Explain how these multiplexing techniques work, and what conditions would prompt you to use the two different multiplexing modes. I <em>strongly</em> encourage you to experiment with displaying two different signals on one of these oscilloscopes as your research. You will likely learn far more from a hands-on exercise than if you were to read about it in a book!</p>
<p><em>Chop</em> is used to display two waveforms when the timebase is set to a slow (low-frequency) setting. <em>Alternate</em> is used to display two waveforms when the timebase is set to a fast (high-frequency) setting.</p>
<p>Don’t simply tell your students how the <em>alternate</em> and <em>chop</em> facilities of their oscilloscopes work. Let them experience these two modes of multiplexing directly, with hands-on investigation. If nothing else, this will provide them with additional practice using oscilloscopes.</p>
