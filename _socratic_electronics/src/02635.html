<p>How does the <em>quality factor</em> (<span class="math"><em>Q</em></span>) of a typical quartz crystal compare to that of a regular LC tank circuit, and what does this indicate about the frequency stability of crystal-controlled oscillators?</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>Q</em></span> values of several <em>thousand</em> are commonplace with crystals, while <span class="math"><em>Q</em></span> values in excess of 10 are considered good for LC tank circuits!</p>
<p>Note that I did not answer the frequency stability question, but left that for the students to figure out.</p>
