<p>A sine-wave signal generator is connected to an amplifier and set to 1 kHz for a performance test, while a spectrum analysis is taken of both the input and the output signals:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02627x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02627x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Answer the following questions about this amplifier test:</p>
<p><span class="math">1. </span> Ideally, what should the output spectrum look like?</p>
<p><span class="math">2. </span> What name do we give to the additional peaks seen in the output signal spectrum analysis?</p>
<p><span class="math">3. </span> What does the presence of these peaks indicate about the amplifier circuit?</p>
<p><span class="math">4. </span> Identify some electrical causes (within a typical amplifier circuit) that could account for these additional peaks.</p>
<p><span class="math">1. </span> Ideally, what should the output spectrum look like? <em>The output spectrum should be identical to the input spectrum, ideally.</em></p>
<p><span class="math">2. </span> What name do we give to the additional peaks seen in the output signal spectrum analysis? <em>These are called harmonics.</em></p>
<p><span class="math">3. </span> What does the presence of these peaks indicate about the amplifier circuit? <em>The amplifier is distorting the signal to some extent.</em></p>
<p><span class="math">4. </span> Identify some electrical causes (within a typical amplifier circuit) that could account for these additional peaks. <em>Improper biasing, poor circuit design (non-ideal component values), excessive loading.</em></p>
