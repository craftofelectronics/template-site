<p>Class B amplifiers are greatly preferred over Class A designs for high-power applications such as audio power amplifiers. Explain why this is.</p>
<p>Class B amplifiers are much more efficient than Class A amplifiers, meaning that they do not waste as much energy in the form of heat dissipation.</p>
<p>Discuss <em>why</em> Class B amplifiers are more efficient than Class A amplifiers with your students. What is it about a Class A amplifier that makes it so inefficient for high-power applications?</p>
