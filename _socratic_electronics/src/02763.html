<p>Crude logic gates circuits may be constructed out of nothing but diodes and resistors. Take for example this logic gate circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02763x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Identify what type of logic function is represented by this gate circuit (AND, OR, inverter, etc.).</p>
<p>This is an OR gate circuit.</p>
<p>Diode-resistor gate circuits such as this are rarely used in real digital circuitry because they have no capacity to <em>amplify</em> weak input signals. They also have no capacity for signal inversion, rendering them incapable of representing a great many logic function types. Gates made from transistors are much preferred over diode-resistor technology.</p>
