<p>Suppose a battery outputs a voltage of 9 volts. Using algebra, calculate how many joules of energy are imparted to every individual electron moving through this battery.</p>
<p>For a 9 volt battery, there will be <span class="math">1. 44 × 10<sup> − 18</sup></span> joules of energy imparted to each electron moving through it.</p>
<p>This problem is another exercise in using scientific notation, and requires that students put concepts together that were learned previously.</p>
