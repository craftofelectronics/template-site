<p>Personal computers and peripheral devices provide a rich source of examples for both serial and parallel data transmission. Identify some common examples of both serial and parallel data transmission networks (and standards) at work in a common personal computer. Examples may include communication between computers, between computers and peripheral devices (printers, scanners, cameras, special cards), or between fundamental components of the computer (CPU, disk drive, monitor, etc.).</p>
<p>Examples of serial data communication include the 9-pin and/or 25 pin &quot;serial&quot; connectors for RS-232C communication, Ethernet communication, USB ports, and most &quot;mice.&quot; Examples of parallel data communication include 25-pin &quot;parallel&quot; connectors to printer and scanner devices, and cables between motherboard and disk drives (legacy IDE technology).</p>
<p>As computer-savvy as most young students are, questions such as these tend to evoke ready responses and strong interest. You may find that little effort is required on your part to introduce these technologies to your students, as they may be more familiar with certain areas and features of it than you!</p>
