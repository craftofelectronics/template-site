<p>Sketch the approximate waveform of this circuit’s output signal (<span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>o</em><em>u</em><em>t</em></sub></span>) on the screen of the oscilloscope:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03503x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Hint: use the Superposition Theorem!</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03503x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Follow-up question: explain why it is acceptable to use a polarized (polarity-sensitive) capacitor in this circuit when it is clearly connected to a source of AC. Why is it not damaged by the AC voltage when used like this?</p>
<p>Note that the capacitor size has been chosen for negligible capacitive reactance (<span class="math"><em>X</em><sub><em>C</em></sub></span>) at the specific frequency, such that the 10 k<span class="math">Ω </span> DC bias resistors present negligible loading to the coupled AC signal. This is typical for this type of biasing circuit.</p>
<p>Aside from giving students an excuse to apply the Superposition Theorem, this question previews a circuit topology that is extremely common in transistor amplifiers.</p>
