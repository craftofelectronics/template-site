<p>Rectifying diodes, like many other types of semiconductor components, should be <em>derated</em> at elevated ambient temperatures. Datasheets often provide &quot;derating curves&quot; that prescribe the maximum current for a range of ambient temperatures.</p>
<p>Explain just what &quot;derating&quot; is, and why it is so important for semiconductor devices.</p>
<p>&quot;Derating&quot; means to downgrade the maximum power rating of a component, in a response to changes in other factors affecting the componentâ€™s operation.</p>
<p>Discuss with your students why temperature is such a critical factor in semiconductor component operation. What happens to a semiconductor junction when it is heated? What may happen if it is heated too much?</p>
