<p>Field effect transistors are classified as <em>majority carrier</em> devices. Explain why.</p>
<p>Conduction through a field-effect transistor depends on charge carriers present in the channel due to doping (the &quot;majority&quot; type of charge carrier).</p>
<p>Review question: in contrast, why are bipolar junction transistors considered <em>minority carrier</em> devices?</p>
<p>Ask your students what type of transistor operates on a <em>minority carrier</em> principle, as opposed to field-effect transistors.</p>
