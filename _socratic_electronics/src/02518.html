<p>Thought it may be tedious to calculate the output voltage for each set of input voltages, working through all the voltage drops and currents in the opamp circuit one at a time, it shows students how they may be able to discern the function of an opamp circuit merely by applying basic laws of electricity (Ohmâ€™s Law, KVL, and KCL) and the &quot;golden assumptions&quot; of negative feedback opamp circuits (no input currents, zero differential input voltage).</p>
