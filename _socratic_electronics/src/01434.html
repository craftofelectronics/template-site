<p>It is common to see a capacitor connected between the &quot;Control&quot; terminal and ground in 555 timer circuits, especially when precise timing is important.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01434x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Explain what purpose the capacitor <span class="math"><em>C</em><sub>2</sub></span> serves in this circuit.</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>C</em><sub>2</sub></span> acts as a decoupling capacitor, to help stabilize the threshold and trigger reference voltages internal to the 555.</p>
<p>Challenge question: what operational parameters of the circuit define the necessary capacitance value of <span class="math"><em>C</em><sub>2</sub></span>?</p>
<p>Decoupling power supply pins on a chip is important, but here students get to see another variation of decoupling. If time permits, work through a sample problem with your students sizing capacitor <span class="math"><em>C</em><sub>2</sub></span>, given a certain operating frequency of the astable circuit. Note: this will give you another opportunity to use Thévenin’s Theorem . . .</p>
