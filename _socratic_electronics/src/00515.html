<p>What does it mean if a battery, or a bank of batteries, receives a <em>floating</em> charge? What does it mean if a battery, or a bank of batteries, receives an <em>equalizing</em> charge?</p>
<p>A &quot;floating&quot; charge is a very low charge rate, just enough to maintain a state of full charge despite normal load fluctuations on the power bus. An &quot;equalizing&quot; charge is a state of overcharging, done to equalize the chemistry in all cells of a battery.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: qualitatively speaking, at what voltage should the power supply be set to in order to &quot;float&quot; a battery bank, versus in order to &quot;equalize&quot; a battery bank?</p>
<p>Being able to identify these types of charge strategies is important, because many battery-powered systems with automatic chargers are either designed to charge in a particular way, or have the ability to switch between different charging modes. Failure to properly charge a battery, or a battery bank, will lead to decreased performance and/or decreased life.</p>
