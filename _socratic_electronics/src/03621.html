<p>A <em>white noise</em> source is a special type of AC signal voltage source which outputs a broad band of frequencies (&quot;noise&quot;) with a constant amplitude across its rated range. Determine what the display of a spectrum analyzer would show if directly connected to a white noise source, and also if connected to a low-pass filter which is in turn connected to a white noise source:</p>

<p>The purpose of this question, besides providing a convenient way to characterize a filter circuit, is to introduce students to the concept of a <em>white noise source</em> and also to strengthen their understanding of a spectrum analyzerâ€™s function.</p>
<p>In case anyone happens to notice, be aware that the rolloff shown for this filter circuit is <em>very</em> steep! This sort of sharp response could never be realized with a simple one-resistor, one-capacitor (&quot;first order&quot;) filter. It would have to be a multi-stage analog filter circuit or some sort of active filter circuit.</p>
