<p>Calculate the amount of power supplied by the source in each of these circuits:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01880x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>What do you notice about these two circuits that is interesting? How much impedance does each source &quot;think&quot; it is supplying power to, based on the following formula?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$Z = {V_{source} \over I_{source}}$</span><br /></p>
<p>In each case, the source outputs the same amount of current, which means it &quot;sees&quot; the same impedance.</p>
<p>I like using specific numerical examples to introduce the concept of impedance transformation, because I find abstract mathematical presentations tend to &quot;lose&quot; a lot of students.</p>
