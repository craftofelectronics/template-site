<p>In 1887, a German physicist named Heinrich Hertz successfully demonstrated the existence of <em>electromagnetic waves</em>. Examine the following schematic of the apparatus he used to do this, and explain what significance Hertz’s discovery has to do with your study of electronics:</p>

<p>Hertz’s experiment empirically demonstrated the theoretical discovery of James Clerk Maxwell, who concluded years before that &quot;electromagnetic waves&quot; comprised of electric and magnetic fields oscillating perpendicular to one another must be capable of radiating through empty space. This is the basis of radio communication: generating these electromagnetic waves for the purpose of communicating information over long distances without wires.</p>
<p>An experiment such as this is not difficult to set up. Be sure to provide the appropriate safety precautions against electric shock, as such spark-gap transmitters (as they came to be called) require substantially high voltages to operate.</p>
