<p>Predict how all component voltages and currents in this circuit will be affected as a result of the following faults. Consider each fault independently (i.e. one at a time, no multiple faults):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03703x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Any one diode fails open:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Transformer secondary winding fails open:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Inductor <span class="math"><em>L</em><sub>1</sub></span> fails open:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Capacitor <span class="math"><em>C</em><sub>1</sub></span> fails shorted:</p>
<p>For each of these conditions, explain <em>why</em> the resulting effects will occur.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Any one diode fails open: <em>Half-wave rectification rather than full-wave, less DC voltage across load, more ripple (AC) voltage across load</em>.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Transformer secondary winding fails open: <em>no voltage or current on secondary side of circuit after <span class="math"><em>C</em><sub>1</sub></span> discharges through load, little current through primary winding</em>.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Inductor <span class="math"><em>L</em><sub>1</sub></span> fails open: <em>no voltage across load, no current through load, no current through rest of secondary-side components, little current through primary winding</em>.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Capacitor <span class="math"><em>C</em><sub>1</sub></span> fails shorted: <em>increased current through both transformer windings, increased current through diodes, increased current through inductor, little voltage across or current through load, capacitor and all diodes will likely get hot</em>.</p>
<p>The purpose of this question is to approach the domain of circuit troubleshooting from a perspective of knowing what the fault is, rather than only knowing what the symptoms are. Although this is not necessarily a realistic perspective, it helps students build the foundational knowledge necessary to diagnose a faulted circuit from empirical data. Questions such as this should be followed (eventually) by other questions asking students to identify likely faults based on measurements.</p>
