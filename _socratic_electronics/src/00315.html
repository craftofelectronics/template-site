<p>The metal case of this appliance is <em>grounded</em> by means of a third conductor:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00315x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Explain how this grounding connection makes the appliance safer for anyone touching its metal case.</p>
<p>The ground wire connection makes the metal case of the appliance electrically common with earth ground.</p>
<p>Ask your students to explain why the caseâ€™s electrical commonality with earth makes it safer to touch. What do they know about &quot;electrically common points&quot; in a circuit, and voltage between those points?</p>
