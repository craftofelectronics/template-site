<p>A clever way to produce sine waves is to pass the output of a square-wave oscillator through a low-pass filter circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03754x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Explain how this principle works, based on your knowledge of Fourierâ€™s theorem.</p>
<p>The LP filter blocks all harmonics of the square wave except the fundamental (1st harmonic), resulting in a sinusoidal output.</p>
<p>Ask your students what they think about the <em>rolloff</em> requirement for this LP filter. Will any LP filter work, or do we need something special?</p>
