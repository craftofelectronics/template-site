<p>A special kind of electric light known as a <em>neon bulb</em> is an excellent tool for demonstrating the presence of static electricity, and is easily obtained at most electronics supply shops:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00144x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>When a large enough static electric charge is applied between the two wires of the neon bulb, the neon gas inside will &quot;ionize&quot; and produce a colored flash of light. Experiment with generating your own static electricity and then making the bulb flash. Hint: it may be easier to see the bulbâ€™s flash if the room is dark.</p>
<p>What conditions produce the brightest flash from the bulb? What materials and techniques work best for producing strong static electric charges?</p>
<p>This is definitely a question best answered by direct experimentation!</p>
<p>If it is difficult for students to obtain neon bulbs in your area, it might be a good idea to provide a few bulbs to experiment with when you give your students this worksheet. They are quite inexpensive and durable little devices.</p>
