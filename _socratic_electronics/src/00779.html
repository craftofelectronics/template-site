<p>What would this permanent-magnet DC motor do, if powered by the following circuit?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00779x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The motor would spin in one direction, with a pulsing torque.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: identify the polarity of the DC voltage between the motor terminals.</p>
<p>Ask your students why the motor’s torque pulsates instead of being steady as it would be when powered by a battery. Is this necessarily a bad thing? How does the motor’s speed compare with being powered by a DC source of the same (RMS-equivalent) voltage?</p>
