<p>Shown here is a schematic diagram for a simple battery-powered flashlight:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00084x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>What could be modified about the circuit or its components to make the flashlight produce more light when turned on?</p>
<p>Somehow, the power dissipated by the light bulb must be increased. Perhaps the most obvious way to increase power dissipation is to use a battery with a greater voltage output, thus giving greater bulb current and greater power. However, this is not the only option! Think of another way the flashlight’s output may be increased.</p>
<p>The &quot;obvious&quot; solution is a direct application of Ohm’s Law. Other solutions may not be so direct, but they will all relate back to Ohm’s Law somehow.</p>
