<p>A large electrical load is outfitted with a wattmeter to measure its true power. If the load voltage is 7.2 kV and the load current is 24 amps, calculate the load’s apparent power (<span class="math"><em>S</em></span>). Calculate the power factor and also the phase angle between voltage and current in the circuit if the wattmeter registers 155 kW at those same voltage and current values.</p>
<p>Draw a &quot;power triangle&quot; for this circuit, graphically showing the relationships between apparent power, true power, and phase angle.</p>
<p>P.F. = 0.897 <span class="math">Θ </span> = 26.23<span class="math">$^{o}$</span></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02187x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>This question provides more practice for students with trigonometry, as well as reinforcing the relationships between <span class="math"><em>S</em></span>, <span class="math"><em>P</em></span>, <span class="math">Θ </span>, and power factor.</p>
