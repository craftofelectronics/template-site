<p>Given the preponderance of 1â€™s in this truth table, it is rational to try developing a POS expression rather than an SOP expression. However, your students may find that the elegance of Karnaugh mapping makes it easy enough to do it both ways! This is one question where you definitely want to have your students explain their methods of solution in front of the class, and you definitely want them to see how Karnaugh maps could be used both ways (SOP and POS).</p>
<p>I have found that an overhead (acetate) or computer-projected image of a blank Karnaugh map on a whiteboard serves well to present Karnaugh maps on. This way, cell entries may be easily erased and re-drawn without having to re-draw the map (grid lines) itself.</p>
