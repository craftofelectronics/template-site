<p>The <em>chain rule</em> of calculus states that:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">${dx \over dy}{dy \over dz} = {dx \over dz}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Similarly, the following mathematical principle is also true:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">${dx \over dy} = {{dx \over dz} \over {dy \over dz}}$</span><br /></p>
<p>It is very easy to build an opamp circuit that differentiates a voltage signal with respect to <em>time</em>, such that an input of <span class="math"><em>x</em></span> produces an output of <span class="math">$dx \over dt$</span>, but there is no simple circuit that will output the differential of one input signal with respect to a second input signal.</p>
<p>However, this does not mean that the task is impossible. Draw a block diagram for a circuit that calculates <span class="math">$dy \over dx$</span>, given the input voltages <span class="math"><em>x</em></span> and <span class="math"><em>y</em></span>. Hint: this circuit will make use of differentiators.</p>
<p>Challenge question: draw a full opamp circuit to perform this function!</p>

<p>Differentiator circuits are very useful devices for making &quot;live&quot; calculations of time-derivatives for variables represented in voltage form. Explain to your students, for example, that the physical measurement of velocity, when differentiated with respect to time, is <em>acceleration</em>. Thus, a differentiator circuit connected to a tachogenerator measuring the speed of something provides a voltage output representing <em>acceleration</em>.</p>
<p>Being able to differentiate one signal in terms of another, although equally useful in physics, is not so easy to accomplish with opamps. A question such as this one highlights a practical use of calculus (the &quot;chain rule&quot;), where the differentiator circuitâ€™s natural function is exploited to achieve a more advanced function.</p>
