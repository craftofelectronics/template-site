<p>A common mathematical function known as <em>factorial</em> is represented by an exclamation point following a positive integer number. The following are all examples of factorials:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$1! = 1 \hbox{\hskip 30pt} 2! = 2 \hbox{\hskip 30pt} 3! = 6 \hbox{\hskip 30pt} 4! = 24 \hbox{\hskip 30pt} 5! = 120 \hbox{\hskip 30pt} 6! = 720$</span><br /></p>
<p>Explain in your own words what this &quot;factorial&quot; function represents. What procedure (algorithm) would we use to arithmetically calculate the value of any factorial given to us?</p>
<p>I’ll let you research this on your own! The algorithm isn’t that difficult to figure out just by examining the sequence of factorials given in the question.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: calculate <span class="math">0!</span></p>
<p>In addition to being very useful in probability calculations, factorials are frequently seen in important mathematical <em>series</em>, including those used to calculate <span class="math"><em>e</em></span>, <span class="math">sin</span>, and <span class="math">cos</span>.</p>
