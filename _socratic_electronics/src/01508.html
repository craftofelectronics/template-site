<p>One thing you will want to do with your completed power supply is subject it to a full-current (1 amp) load, and test the output voltage. To do this, you will need a load that draws close to 1 amp without overheating or causing other problems.</p>
<p>A resistor will work fine for this task, but which resistor should you use? Identify the <em>two</em> parameters you must be concerned about when selecting a load resistor for the task, and explain exactly how those parameters will be calculated.</p>
<p>The two parameters are: <em>resistance</em> (how many ohms), and <em>power rating</em> (how many watts). I will leave it to you to show how to calculate each parameter for your particular power supply.</p>
<p>Even though this is nothing more than an application of Ohm’s Law, do not be surprised if students approach you dumbfounded by this question. There is a large cognitive difference between calculating current and power for a resistor of known value and a voltage source of known voltage, and selecting a resistor based on known current and voltage for a practical test of a power supply. While studying Ohm’s Law in a theoretical context, students become comfortable making calculations on paper, but may not realize just how to apply that same math to a real-world situation. Or, they may express apprehension when faced with having to make calculations that carry real consequences (such as damaging their power supply!).</p>
