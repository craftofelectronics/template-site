<p>An important measurement of pulse waveforms is <em>duty cycle</em>. Give a precise. mathematical definition for this term.</p>
<p>Also, write an equation solving for pulse width given duty cycle (<span class="math"><em>D</em></span>) and frequency (<span class="math"><em>f</em></span>).</p>
<p>&quot;Duty cycle&quot; is a measure of a pulse waveform’s <em>on</em> time versus its <em>total</em> time (period):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$D = {t_{on} \over t_{total}}$</span><br /></p>
<p>I’ll let you figure out how to write an equation solving for pulse width (<span class="math"><em>t</em><sub><em>o</em><em>n</em></sub></span>) in terms of duty cycle and frequency.</p>
<p>Duty cycle is a very important concept, as analog information may be conveyed through the variable duty cycle of an otherwise digital pulse waveform. Discuss this application with your students, if time permits.</p>
