<p>Predict how this circuit will be affected as a result of the following faults. Consider each fault independently (i.e. one at a time, no multiple faults):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03719x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Diode <span class="math"><em>D</em><sub>1</sub></span> fails open:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Transistor <span class="math"><em>Q</em><sub>1</sub></span> fails shorted (drain-to-source):</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Transistor <span class="math"><em>Q</em><sub>1</sub></span> fails open (drain-to-source):</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Transistor <span class="math"><em>Q</em><sub>2</sub></span> fails shorted (collector-to-emitter):</p>
<p>For each of these conditions, explain <em>why</em> the resulting effects will occur.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Diode <span class="math"><em>D</em><sub>1</sub></span> fails open: <em>Audio signal always passes through and cannot be turned off.</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Transistor <span class="math"><em>Q</em><sub>1</sub></span> fails shorted (drain-to-source): <em>Audio signal always passes through and cannot be turned off.</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Transistor <span class="math"><em>Q</em><sub>1</sub></span> fails open (drain-to-source): <em>Audio signal never passes through and cannot be turned on.</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Transistor <span class="math"><em>Q</em><sub>2</sub></span> fails shorted (collector-to-emitter): <em>Audio signal never passes through and cannot be turned on.</em></p>
<p>The purpose of this question is to approach the domain of circuit troubleshooting from a perspective of knowing what the fault is, rather than only knowing what the symptoms are. Although this is not necessarily a realistic perspective, it helps students build the foundational knowledge necessary to diagnose a faulted circuit from empirical data. Questions such as this should be followed (eventually) by other questions asking students to identify likely faults based on measurements.</p>
