<p>When the pushbutton is pressed, the relay immediately energizes and sends power to the electric horn. When the pushbutton is released, the horn remains on for a few moments before turning off, due to the capacitor’s stored charge continuing to power the relay coil. So, the capacitor and relay form a <em>time-delay</em> control circuit for the horn:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03441x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Suppose this circuit has functioned as designed for quite some time, then one day develops a problem. The horn sounds immediately when the pushbutton is pressed (as it should), bit it immediately silences instead of continuing to sound for a few more moments when the pushbutton is released. Based on this information, identify these things:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> components or wires in the circuit that you know must be in good working condition.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> components or wires in the circuit that could possibly be bad (and thus cause the off-delay action to fail).</p>
<p>Obviously the horn, relay, switch, and battery are all working normally. The capacitor could be bad (failed open), as well as the wiring/connections between the capacitor and the coil.</p>
<p>The purpose of this troubleshooting question is to get students to think in terms of fault elimination: deciding what things <em>cannot</em> be bad in order to better isolate what might be bad.</p>
