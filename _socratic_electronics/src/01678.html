<p><strong>Caution!</strong> Consult your instructor to see how to set up each power supply to be a <em>safe</em> current source before attempting to connect them together!</p>
<p>Use circuit simulation software to verify schematic diagram. Your real circuit will verify the pictorial diagram.</p>
<p>Use regulated power supplies with adjustable current limits to act as current sources (voltage adjustments set to &quot;full&quot; while current adjustments set the desired output current for each). Keep the currents less than one amp for each supply.</p>
