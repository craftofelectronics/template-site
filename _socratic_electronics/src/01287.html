<p>Though many electronics students and professionals alike associate semiconductor components with the word &quot;digital,&quot; electromechanical relays are also digital logic (on or off) devices. In fact, some of the first digital computers were built with electromechanical relays as their active elements.</p>
<p>In what ways are electromechanical relays similar to semiconductor logic gates? In what ways do the two digital technologies differ?</p>
<p>Like semiconductor gates, electromechanical relays have but two states: energized and de-energized (1 and 0). Like gates, the contacts of relays may be interconnected to perform standard logic functions such as AND, OR, NAND, NOR, and NOT.</p>
<p>This question provides a good opportunity to review electromechanical relays: how they work, what they are used for, etc.</p>
