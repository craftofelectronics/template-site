<p>Note the effect of adding the second harmonic of a waveform to the fundamental, and compare that effect with adding the <em>third</em> harmonic of a waveform to the fundamental:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01892x02.eps} \hskip 20pt \epsfbox{01892x03.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01892x01.eps} \hskip 20pt \epsfbox{01892x04.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Now compare the sums of a fundamental with its fourth harmonic, versus with its fifth harmonic:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01892x05.eps} \hskip 20pt \epsfbox{01892x06.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01892x07.eps} \hskip 20pt \epsfbox{01892x08.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>And again for the 1st + 6th, versus the 1st + 7th harmonics:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01892x09.eps} \hskip 20pt \epsfbox{01892x10.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01892x11.eps} \hskip 20pt \epsfbox{01892x12.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Examine these sets of harmonic sums, and indicate the trend you see with regard to harmonic number and symmetry of the final (Sum) waveforms. Specifically, how does the addition of an <em>even</em> harmonic compare to the addition of an <em>odd</em> harmonic, in terms of final waveshape?</p>
<p>The addition of an even harmonic introduces asymmetry about the horizontal axis. The addition of odd harmonics does not.</p>
<p>Challenge question: explain <em>why</em> this is the case, any way you can.</p>
<p>Although the sequence of images presented in the question by no means constitutes a formal proof, it should lead students to observe a trend: that odd harmonics do not make a waveform unsymmetrical about the horizontal axis, whereas even harmonics do. Given these two facts, we may make qualitative judgments about the harmonic content of a waveform simply by visually checking for symmetry about the horizontal axis.</p>
<p>Incidentally, some students have a difficult time grasping the concept of symmetry about the horizontal axis of a waveform. Take this simple example, which <em>is</em> symmetrical about its horizontal centerline:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01892x13.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Some students will protest that this waveform is <em>not</em> symmetrical about its centerline, because it does not look exactly the same as before after flipping. They must bear in mind, though, that this is just one cycle of a continuous waveform. In reality, the waveform looks like this before and after flipping:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01892x14.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>All one needs to do to see that these two waveforms are indeed identical is to do a 180 degree phase shift (shifting either to the left or to the right):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01892x15.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>By contrast, a waveform without symmetry about the horizontal axis cannot be made to look the same after flipping, no matter what subsequent phase shift is given to it:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01892x16.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Another way to describe this asymmetry is in terms of the waveform’s departure from the centerline, compared to its return to the centerline. Is the rate-of-change (<span class="math">$dv \over dt$</span> for a voltage waveform) equal in magnitude and opposite in sign at each of these points, or is there a difference in magnitude as well? Discuss ways to identify this type of asymmetry, and what it means in terms of harmonic content.</p>
<p>Mathematically, this symmetry is defined as such:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$f(t) = -f \left(t + {T \over 2} \right)$</span><br /></p>
<p>Where,</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>f</em>(<em>t</em>) = </span> Function of waveform with time as the independent variable</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>t</em> = </span> Time</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>T</em> = </span> Period of waveform, in same units of time as <span class="math"><em>t</em></span></p>
