<p>Write an SOP expression for this truth table, and then draw a ladder logic (relay) circuit diagram corresponding to that SOP expression:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01334x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Implement the SOP logic function using contacts of relays CR1, CR2, and CR3. A partial ladder logic diagram has been provided for you.</p>
<p>Finally, simplify this expression using Boolean algebra, and draw a simplified ladder logic diagram based on this new (reduced) Boolean expression. When deciding &quot;how far&quot; to reduce the Boolean expression, choose a form that results in the minimum number of relay contacts in the simplified ladder logic diagram.</p>
<p>Original SOP expression and relay circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01334x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Reduced expression and relay circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01334x03.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Discuss with your students the utility of Boolean algebra as a circuit simplification tool. Ask your students to compare the original and reduced logic gate circuits, and comment on such performance metrics as reliability, power consumption, maximum operating speed, etc.</p>
