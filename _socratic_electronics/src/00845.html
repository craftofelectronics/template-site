<p>Some precision operational amplifiers are <em>programmable</em>. What does this feature mean? In what way can you &quot;program&quot; an op-amp?</p>
<p>A &quot;programmable&quot; op-amp is one with extra connections to its internal circuitry allowing you to set the current source values using external components.</p>
<p>What possible benefits are there to &quot;programming&quot; the current source values in an operational amplifier? Discuss this with your students, asking them to share what theyâ€™ve found through their research.</p>
