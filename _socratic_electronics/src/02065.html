<p>You should discuss with your students the fact that IGBTâ€™s are not actually made of two discrete transistors connected as shown. Instead, they are fabricated as monolithic devices, all on the same semiconductor substrate. The &quot;model&quot; of an IGBT consisting of a MOSFET coupled to a BJT is similar to the model commonly used to emulate an SCR: a circuit whose sole purpose it is to show the operation of a special device in terms of other, well-understood devices.</p>
