<p>There are three fundamental operations in Boolean algebra: addition, multiplication, and inversion. Each of these operations has an equivalent logic gate function and an equivalent relay circuit configuration. Draw the corresponding gate and ladder logic diagrams for each:</p>

<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02779x03.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02779x05.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02779x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02779x04.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02779x06.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>These three equivalencies will be vital for students to master as they study combinational logic circuits and complex relay logic circuits!</p>
