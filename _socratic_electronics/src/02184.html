<p>The &quot;power triangle&quot; is a very useful model for understanding the mathematical relationship between apparent power (<span class="math"><em>S</em></span>), true power (<span class="math"><em>P</em></span>), and reactive power (<span class="math"><em>Q</em></span>):</p>

<p>Explain what happens to the triangle if power factor correction components are added to a circuit. What side(s) change length on the triangle, and what happens to the angle <span class="math">Θ </span>?</p>
<p>As power factor is brought closer to unity (1), the power triangle &quot;flattens,&quot; with <span class="math"><em>P</em></span> remaining constant:</p>

<p>Ask your students to explain what the &quot;triangle&quot; looks like at a power factor of unity.</p>
