<p>High-precision ohmmeters use a <em>four-wire</em> electrical connection to the resistance under test, rather than a two-wire connection. Explain how the four-wire system works, and why it provides better accuracy than two-wire resistance measurement.</p>
<p>Two-wire ohmmeters measure not only the resistance under test, but also the added resistance of their own test leads. Four-wire ohmmeters <em>only</em> measure the resistance under test.</p>
<p>It is one thing to explain how four-wire resistance measurement works, but another to describe how you would set up your own four-wire (&quot;Kelvin&quot;) resistance measurement system using normal two-wire meters. Challenge your students with this problem, to test their comprehension of the concept.</p>
