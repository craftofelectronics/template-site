<p>Use circuit simulation software to verify your predicted and measured parameter values.</p>
<p>The <em>real</em> challenge in this assessment is for students to determine their transformers’ &quot;polarities&quot; before connecting them to the AC voltage source! For this, they should have access to a small battery and a DC voltmeter (at their desks).</p>
<p>You may use a Variac at the test bench to provide variable-voltage AC power for the students’ transformer circuits. I recommend specifying load resistance values low enough that the load current completely &quot;swamps&quot; the transformer’s magnetization current. This may mean using wire-wound power resistors instead of <span class="math">$1 \over 4$</span> watt carbon composition resistors.</p>
<p>Note that there may very well be a shock hazard associated with this circuit, as the output voltage is not far below the line voltage! Be sure to take this into consideration when specifying load resistor values. You may also want to use low supply voltage levels (turn the Variac <em>way</em> down).</p>
<p>In lieu of using a line-powered transformer, you may also do this exercise with a signal generator and an audio-frequency transformer. The principles are the same, and the safety hazard will be vastly reduced. If using a 1000:8 ohm transformer, the winding turns ratio is approximately 11.18 to 1.</p>
<p>An extension of this exercise is to incorporate troubleshooting questions. Whether using this exercise as a performance assessment or simply as a concept-building lab, you might want to follow up your students’ results by asking them to predict the consequences of certain circuit faults.</p>
