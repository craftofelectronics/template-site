<p>One of the idiosyncrasies of analog-to-digital conversion is a phenomenon known as <em>aliasing</em>. It happens when an ADC attempts to digitize a waveform with too high of a frequency.</p>
<p>Explain what aliasing is, how it happens, and what may be done to prevent it from happening to an ADC circuit.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, a picture is worth a thousand words:</p>

<p>The point of this question (and of the answer given) is to have students put this important concept into their own words.</p>
<p>Something noteworthy for students and instructors alike is that aliasing may be visually experienced using digital oscilloscopes. Setting the timebase (seconds/division) control too slow may result in a false (aliased) waveform displayed in the oscilloscope. Not only does this make a good classroom demonstration, but it also is a great lesson to learn if one expects to use digital oscilloscopes on a regular basis!</p>
