<p>One of the conductors connecting the secondary of a three-phase power distribution transformer to a large office building fails open. Upon inspection, the source of the failure is obvious: the wire overheated at a point of contact with a terminal block, until it physically separated from the terminal.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00411x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>What is strange, though, is that the overheated wire is the <em>neutral</em> conductor, not any one of the &quot;line&quot; conductors. Based on this observation, what do you think caused the failure?</p>
<p>After repairing the wire, what would you do to verify the cause of the failure?</p>
<p>Hereâ€™s a hint: if you were to repair the neutral wire and take current measurements with a digital instrument (using a clamp-on current probe, for safety), you would find that the predominant frequency of the current is 180 Hz, rather than 60 Hz.</p>
<p>This scenario is all too common in modern power systems, as non-linear loads such as switching power supplies and electronic power controls become more prevalent. Special instruments exist to measure harmonics in power systems, but a simple DMM (digital multimeter) may be used as well to make crude assessments such as the one described in the Answer.</p>
