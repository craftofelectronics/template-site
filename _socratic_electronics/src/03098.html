<p>An electronic counter is installed at the entrance doorway of a large convention room to count the number of people entering. As each person passes through the doorway, their body interrupts a light beam from an infra-red LED to a matching phototransistor, sending a pulse to the counter IC (LED light striking the phototransistor <span class="math"><em>Q</em><sub>1</sub></span> turns it on, and the absence of LED light turns it off). Every tenth person that enters is supposed to win a prize, so the job of this circuit is to ring a bell for every tenth person who enters (at the &quot;terminal count&quot; state). The problem is, the bell was working just fine a few hours ago, but hasn’t rung ever since. Some of the convention attendees are starting to get angry, demanding door prizes.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03098x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>You begin troubleshooting by taking voltage measurements while people randomly enter the room (breaking the light beam as they do). Using your voltmeter, you measure a momentary pulse of voltage (+5 volts) at TP9 with respect to ground when every tenth person walks through the doorway.</p>
<p>From this information, identify two possible causes that could account for the problem and all measured values in this circuit. Also, identify the next logical test point(s) from those shown on the schematic that you would check with a voltmeter, and why you would check there. Note that there may be more than one correct answer to this part of the question!</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Possible causes of the problem</p>

<p>Note: the following answers are not exhaustive. There may be more circuit elements possibly at fault than what is listed here!</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Possible causes of the problem</p>
<p>1. 12 volt battery dead</p>
<p>2. Transistor <span class="math"><em>Q</em><sub>2</sub></span> failed open or shorted</p>
<p>3. Resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>3</sub></span> failed open</p>
<p>4. Solenoid coil failed open</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Next logical test point(s) to check, with reason why you would check there</p>
<p>- TP7 to ground, to see if <span class="math"><em>Q</em><sub>2</sub></span> is turning on</p>
<p>- TP8 to ground, to see if the 12 volt battery is dead</p>
<p>- TP15 to ground, to see if <span class="math"><em>Q</em><sub>2</sub></span> is being &quot;told&quot; to turn on</p>
