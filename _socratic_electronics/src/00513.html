<p>A spool of #10 AWG aluminum wire is 500 feet long. If the ambient temperature is 80<span class="math">$^{o}$</span> F, what is its end-to-end electrical resistance? Explain all the calculations necessary to solve this problem.</p>
<p>0.7899 <span class="math">Ω </span></p>
<p>Solving this problem requires several concepts be integrated: calculating the resistance of a wire given its metal type, length, and gauge; converting between different temperature units; and calculating shift in resistance due to temperature.</p>
