<p>Calculate both the maximum and the minimum amount of voltage obtainable from this potentiometer circuit (as measured between the wiper and ground):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03248x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>m</em><em>a</em><em>x</em></sub></span> = 3.85 volts</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>m</em><em>i</em><em>n</em></sub></span> = 0.35 volts</p>
<p>Be sure to ask your students how they obtained their answers, not just what the answers are. There is more than one correct way to analyze this circuit!</p>
<p>Incidentally, there is nothing significant about the use of European schematic symbols in this question. I did this simply to provide students with more exposure to this schematic convention.</p>
