<p>Solve for the value of <span class="math"><em>a</em></span> in the following equations:</p>
<p>Equation 1: <span class="math"><em>a</em> − 4 = 10</span></p>
<p>Equation 2: <span class="math">30 = <em>a</em> + 3</span></p>
<p>Equation 3: <span class="math"> − 2<em>a</em> = 9</span></p>
<p>Equation 4: <span class="math">${a \over 4} = 3.5$</span></p>
<p>Equation 1: <span class="math"><em>a</em> = 14</span></p>
<p>Equation 2: <span class="math"><em>a</em> = 27</span></p>
<p>Equation 3: <span class="math"><em>a</em> =  − 4. 5</span></p>
<p>Equation 4: <span class="math"><em>a</em> = 14</span></p>
<p>Have your students come to the front of the class and show everyone else the techniques they used to solve for the value of <span class="math"><em>a</em></span> in each equation. Remind them to document each and every step in the process, so that nothing is left to guess or to chance.</p>
