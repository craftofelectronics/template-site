<p>For a given amount of electric current, which resistor will dissipate the greatest amount of power: a small value (low-resistance) resistor, or a high value (high-resistance) resistor? Explain your answer.</p>
<p>A resistor with a high resistance rating (many &quot;ohms&quot; of resistance) will dissipate more heat power than a lower-valued resistor, given the same amount of electric current through it.</p>
<p>This question is designed to make students think <em>qualitatively</em> about the relationship between current, resistance, and power. I have found that qualitative (non-numeric) analysis is often more challenging than asking students to calculate answers quantitatively (with numbers). Often, simple math is a kind of barrier behind which students seek refuge from true understanding of a topic. In other words, it is easier to punch keys on a calculator (or even perform calculations with paper and pencil) than to really <em>think</em> about the inter-relationships of variables in a physical problem. Yet, a qualitative understanding of electrical systems is vital to fast and efficient troubleshooting.</p>
