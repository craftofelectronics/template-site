<p>Most oscilloscopes have at least two vertical inputs, used to display more than one waveform simultaneously:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01821x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>While this feature is extremely useful, one must be careful in connecting two sources of AC voltage to an oscilloscope. Since the &quot;reference&quot; or &quot;ground&quot; clips of <em>each</em> probe are electrically common with the oscilloscopeâ€™s metal chassis, they are electrically common with each other as well.</p>
<p>Explain what sort of problem would be caused by connecting a dual-trace oscilloscope to a circuit in the following manner:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01821x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The oscilloscope will create an earth-grounded short circuit in this series resistor circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01821x03.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>If the signal generator is earth-grounded through its power cord as well, the problem could even be worse:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01821x04.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Follow-up question: explain why the second scenario is potentially more hazardous than the first.</p>
<p>Failing to consider that the &quot;ground&quot; leads on all probes are common to each other (as well as common to the safety ground conductor of the line power system) is a <em>very</em> common mistake among students first learning how to use oscilloscopes. Hopefully, discussing scenarios such as this will help students avoid this problem in their labwork.</p>
<p><em>Note to Socratic Electronics developers: the oscilloscope shown in figure 01821x01.eps is made up of individual lines, circles, text elements, etc., rather than a single object as is contained in the Xcircuit library file (scope.lps). If you wish to edit the features of this scope, start with the 01821x01.eps image file rather than the library object!</em> Then you may save your modified oscilloscope as a complete object in your own image library for future use.</p>
