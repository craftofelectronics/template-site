<p>Use circuit simulation software to verify your predicted and measured parameter values.</p>
<p>Use a sine-wave function generator for the AC voltage source. Specify standard resistor and capacitor values.</p>
<p>I recommend setting the function generator output for 1 volt, to make it easier for students to measure the point of &quot;cutoff&quot;. You may set it at some other value, though, if you so choose (or let students set the value themselves when they test the circuit!).</p>
<p>I also recommend having students use an oscilloscope to measure AC voltage in a circuit such as this, because some digital multimeters have difficulty accurately measuring AC voltage much beyond line frequency range. I find it particularly helpful to set the oscilloscope to the &quot;X-Y&quot; mode so that it draws a thin line on the screen rather than sweeps across the screen to show an actual waveform. This makes it easier to measure peak-to-peak voltage.</p>
<p>An extension of this exercise is to incorporate troubleshooting questions. Whether using this exercise as a performance assessment or simply as a concept-building lab, you might want to follow up your studentsâ€™ results by asking them to predict the consequences of certain circuit faults.</p>
