<p>What performance parameters are important to consider for <span class="math"><em>U</em><sub>1</sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>U</em><sub>2</sub></span>, considering their use in a logic probe circuit? Hint: we may want to use this logic probe to troubleshoot CMOS as well as TTL circuits.</p>
<p>First and foremost, we need to consider the supply voltage ranges for all integrated circuits used in this circuit. Do <em>not</em> use 7400-series TTL NAND gate for <span class="math"><em>U</em><sub>2</sub></span> if you ever plan to use this logic probe on digital circuits with power supply voltages in excess of 5 volts!</p>
<p>Note how the comparators <em>sink</em> current from the LEDs rather than <em>source</em> current to them. This design feature was necessary, due to the construction of the LM339. In fact, there are a lot of comparators that can only sink current and not source current due to the internal use of an open-collector output stage.</p>
