<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02515x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Follow-up question: what would be required to get this circuit to output the <em>exact</em> sum of the four input voltages?</p>
<p>This question not only provides practice analyzing the behavior of a summer circuit, but also analyzing the behavior of a passive averager circuit. If your students need some refreshing on how to analyze the passive averager, you might want to review Millmanâ€™s Theorem with them.</p>
