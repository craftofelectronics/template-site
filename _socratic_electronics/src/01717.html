<p>Identify which of these circuits is a <em>series</em> circuit (there may be more than one shown!):</p>

<p>Circuits <strong>A</strong>, <strong>C</strong>, and <strong>F</strong> are <em>series</em> circuits.</p>
<p>The purpose of this question is to get students to identify what distinguishing characteristic uniquely identifies a circuit as being &quot;series.&quot; Once this has been identified, there are several conclusions which may be deduced (regarding voltage drops, currents, resistances, etc.).</p>
<p>Circuit <strong>F</strong> is thrown in the mix just to show students that the non-battery components donâ€™t have to all be the same (resistors) in order for a circuit to qualify as &quot;series.&quot;</p>
