<p>Use circuit simulation software to verify your predicted and measured parameter values.</p>
<p>Use a sine-wave function generator for the AC voltage source. Specify standard resistor, capacitor, and inductor values. I have used a small 100 mH inductor, a 0.033 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>F capacitor, and 100 <span class="math">Ω </span> resistor with good success. In any case I recommend keeping the resonant frequency within the mid-audio range (1 kHz to 10 kHz) to avoid problems with low inductor <span class="math"><em>Q</em></span> (frequency too low) and stray capacitance and inductance issues (frequency too high).</p>
<p>I also recommend having students use an oscilloscope to measure AC voltage in a circuit such as this, because some digital multimeters have difficulty accurately measuring AC voltage much beyond line frequency range. I find it particularly helpful to set the oscilloscope to the &quot;X-Y&quot; mode so that it draws a thin line on the screen rather than sweeps across the screen to show an actual waveform. This makes it easier to measure peak-to-peak voltage.</p>
<p>An extension of this exercise is to incorporate troubleshooting questions. Whether using this exercise as a performance assessment or simply as a concept-building lab, you might want to follow up your students’ results by asking them to predict the consequences of certain circuit faults.</p>
