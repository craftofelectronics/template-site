<p>In this phasor diagram, determine which phasor is <em>leading</em> and which is <em>lagging</em> the other:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03286x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>In this diagram, phasor <span class="math">${\bf B}$</span> is leading phasor <span class="math">${\bf A}$</span>.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: using a protractor, estimate the amount of phase shift between these two phasors.</p>
<p>It may be helpful to your students to remind them of the standard orientation for phase angles in phasor diagrams (0 degrees to the right, 90 degrees up, etc.).</p>
