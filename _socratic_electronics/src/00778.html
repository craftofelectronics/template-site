<p>What would this permanent-magnet DC motor do, if powered by a source of AC voltage?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00778x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The motor would vibrate, as the shaft tries to rotate back and forth as quickly as the AC cycles.</p>
<p>Discuss this phenomenon with your students. Ask them whether they know of any other &quot;polarized&quot; (DC-only) devices. Ask them what they think would be necessary to make a DC-only device function on AC power.</p>
