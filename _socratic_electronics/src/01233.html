<p>A nearly universal standard for representing text data in digital form is the <em>ASCII</em> code. What does the acronym &quot;ASCII&quot; stand for, and what is the format of this code?</p>
<p>&quot;ASCII&quot; = American Standard Code for Information Interchange. Basic ASCII is a seven-bit binary code capable of representing all alphabetical characters used in the English language (upper-case as well as lower), as well as Arabic numerals, English punctuation marks, and some miscellaneous control codes for teletype machines.</p>
<p>Challenge question: although ASCII technically requires only 7 bits, a full 8 bits (1 byte) is usually reserved for each ASCII character in computer systems. Explain why.</p>
<p>ASCII is arguably the <em>lingua franca</em> of the digital world. Despite its humble beginnings and Anglo-centric format, it is used worldwide in digital computer and telecommunication systems. Let your students know that every plain-text computer file is nothing more than a collection of ASCII codes, one code for each text character (including spaces).</p>
