<p>Calculate the current in this circuit, and also the amount of mechanical power (in units of &quot;horsepower&quot;) required to turn this alternator (assume 100% efficiency):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00767x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math"><em>I</em></span> = 141.18 A</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>P</em></span> = 90.8 horsepower</p>
<p>Solving this problem requires unit conversions: from &quot;watts&quot; to &quot;horsepower.&quot; Let your students research how to perform this conversion, then discuss their various techniques during discussion time.</p>
