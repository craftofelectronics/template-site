<p>The coefficient of magnetic coupling between two coils affects the amount of mutual inductance between those two coils. This fact should be obvious, as coils not sharing any magnetic flux (<span class="math"><em>k</em> = 0</span>) cannot have any mutual inductance between them.</p>
<p>Write an equation defining <span class="math"><em>M</em></span> in terms of <span class="math"><em>L</em><sub>1</sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>L</em><sub>2</sub></span>, when <span class="math"><em>k</em></span> is something less than 1.</p>
<p><span class="math">$M = k \sqrt{L_1 L_2}$</span></p>
<p>Ask your students <em>how</em> they obtained their answer. Of course this equation may be found in many basic electronics textbooks, but the point of this question is for students to see how it may be <em>derived</em> from the equations they already know.</p>
