<p>The <em>Orbiting Astronomical Observatory</em> was a NASA project during the late 1960’s and 1970’s to place precision observational instruments in earth orbit for scientific purposes. Satellites designed for this program had to have &quot;hardened&quot; circuitry to withstand the radiation, extreme temperatures, and other harsh conditions of space.</p>
<p>An example of some of this &quot;fail-safe&quot; circuitry is shown here: a quad-redundant inverter (NOT) gate:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01330x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Explain why the circuit is referred to as <em>quad</em>-redundant. How many individual component failures, minimum, must occur before the gate’s functionality is compromised? Prove your answer through an analysis of the circuit’s operation.</p>
<p>If you analyze this circuit carefully, you will find that it may actually fail with just <em>two</em> component faults, if they are the right type of fault, in the right locations!</p>
<p>This circuit is a good one to discuss with your students in class. Ask them to explain its basic operation: if all components are functioning properly, what happens when it receives a &quot;high&quot; input, versus a &quot;low&quot; input? Do the input signals need to be current-<em>sourcing</em> or current-<em>sinking</em>? What about the output of this circuit: does it source or sink current?</p>
