<p>Standard ASCII codes are seven bits in length, but communications equipment usually sends data in eight-bit (byte) groups. The extra bit is often used as a <em>parity bit</em>. What is the purpose of a &quot;parity bit,&quot; and how is it used?</p>
<p>&quot;Parity bits&quot; are used as a primitive form of error detection. Communications equipment making use of parity for error detection may either be configured for &quot;even parity&quot; or for &quot;odd parity&quot;. Iâ€™ll let you research and explain how parity bits are used in the transmission of ASCII data.</p>
<p>The concept of parity is not very complex. It should be well within the reach of students to research on their own and report their findings to the class as a whole.</p>
