<p>If this circuit is built and operated, it will be found that the resistor becomes much hotter than the inductor, even though both components drop the exact same amount of voltage and carry the exact same amount of current:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02177x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Explain why there is such a remarkable difference in heat output between these two components, given their identical voltage drops and currents.</p>
<p>The inductor can only store and release energy, not dissipate it. Therefore, its actual power dissipation is zero!</p>
<p>This question seeks to challenge studentsâ€™ perceptions of what constitutes electrical power. From the physical effects described, it is evident that there is more to calculating power than simply multiplying a voltage drop by a current!</p>
