<p>If I wanted to build a battery-powered electric drill, would it be better to use <em>primary</em> cell batteries, or <em>secondary</em> cell batteries? Explain your answer.</p>
<p>&quot;Secondary&quot; cell batteries would be better to use for an application such as an electric drill, because it would be wasteful to have to discard so many primary-cell batteries at the rate they would be &quot;consumed&quot; powering such a device.</p>
<p>Basically, the point of this question is to get students to research what the difference is between a primary and a secondary cell. Framing the question in a practical context makes it more interesting, and involves other practical issues as well (economics, conservation, etc.).</p>
