<p>By moving a permanent magnet perpendicularly past a wire, a voltage will be generated between the ends of that wire:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00255x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Describe what factors determine the polarity and magnitude of this voltage.</p>
<p>Rather than give the answer here, Iâ€™ll leave it to you to determine the answer by experiment!</p>
<p>Experiments like this are so easy to set up, it would be a shame to spoil the joy of firsthand discovery by simply telling students what is supposed to happen!</p>
