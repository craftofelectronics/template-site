<p>Predict how the operation of this active filter circuit will be affected as a result of the following faults. Consider each fault independently (i.e. one at a time, no multiple faults):</p>

<p><span class="math"> • </span> Resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span> fails open: <em>Output saturates (either positive or negative) when there is any DC voltage input to the circuit.</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Capacitor <span class="math"><em>C</em><sub>1</sub></span> fails open: <em>No filtering action at all, merely operates as a fixed-gain amplifier.</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Solder bridge (short) across resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span>: <em>Output signal is always a square wave.</em></p>

<p>The purpose of this question is to approach the domain of circuit troubleshooting from a perspective of knowing what the fault is, rather than only knowing what the symptoms are. Although this is not necessarily a realistic perspective, it helps students build the foundational knowledge necessary to diagnose a faulted circuit from empirical data. Questions such as this should be followed (eventually) by other questions asking students to identify likely faults based on measurements.</p>
