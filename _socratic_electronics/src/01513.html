<p>Explain the principle of operation for the particular integrated circuit you are using in your signal generator device. How does it function, internally? Explain how it produces each of the following wave-shapes:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Triangle wave</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Square wave</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Sine wave</p>
<p>Answers to this question vary, of course, with the integrated circuit you are using.</p>
<p>This question provides an excellent opportunity for students to research their chips’ datasheets, and to comprehend what engineers have written there.</p>
