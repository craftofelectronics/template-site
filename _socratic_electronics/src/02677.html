<p>The concept of a mathematical <em>power</em> is familiar to most students of algebra. For instance, ten to the third power means this:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">10<sup>3</sup> = 10 × 10 × 10 = 1000</span><br /></p>
<p>. . . and eight to the seventh power means this:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">8<sup>7</sup> = 8 × 8 × 8 × 8 × 8 × 8 × 8 = 2, 097, 152</span><br /></p>
<p>Just as subtraction is the inverse function of addition, and division is the inverse function of multiplication (because with inverse functions, one &quot;undoes&quot; the other), there is also an inverse function for a power and we call it the <em>logarithm</em>.</p>
<p>Re-write the expression <span class="math">10<sup>3</sup> = 1000</span> so that it uses the same quantities (10, 3, and 1000) in the context of a logarithm instead of a power, just as the subtraction is shown here to be the inverse of addition, and division is shown to be the inverse of multiplication in the following examples:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$3 + 8 = 11 \hbox{\hskip 30pt (+ and - are inverse functions) \hskip 30pt} 11 - 3 = 8$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$2 \times 7 = 14 \hbox{\hskip 30pt} (\times \hbox{ and} \div \hbox{are inverse functions)} \hbox{\hskip 30pt} 14 \div 2 = 7$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$10^3 = 1000 \hbox{\hskip 30pt (powers and logs are inverse functions) \hskip 30pt} \log_{10} \hbox{???} = \hbox{???}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$10^3 = 1000 \hbox{\hskip 30pt (powers and logs are inverse functions) \hskip 30pt} \log_{10} 1000 = 3$</span><br /></p>
<p>In my experience, most American students are woefully underprepared for the subject of logarithms when they study with me. Admittedly, logarithms do not see as much use in everyday life as powers do (and that is very little for most people as it is!). Logarithms used to be common fare for secondary school and college students, as they were essential for the operation of a <em>slide rule</em>, an elegant mechanical analog computing device popular decades ago.</p>
<p>The purpose of this question is to twofold: to get students to realize what a logarithm is, and also to remind them of the concept of inverse functions, which become very important in analog computational circuits.</p>
