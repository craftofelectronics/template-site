<p>If this alternator is spun at 4500 RPM (revolutions per minute), what will be the frequency of its output voltage?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00819x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Hint: how many cycles of AC are produced for every revolution of the rotor?</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>f</em> = </span> 75 Hz</p>
<p>Students should realize that there is one cycle of AC voltage produced for every revolution of the rotor shaft. From that point, the problem is simply a matter of unit conversions.</p>
