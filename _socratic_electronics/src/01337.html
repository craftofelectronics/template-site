<p>In an SOP expression, the minimum requirement for the expression’s total value to be equal to 1 is that at least one of the product terms must be equal to 1. For instance, in the following SOP expression, we know that the value will be equal to 1 if <span class="math"><em>A</em><em>B</em><em>C</em> = 1</span> or if <span class="math">$A\overline{B}\&gt; \overline{C} = 1$</span> or if <span class="math">$AB\overline{C} = 1$</span>:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$ABC + A\overline{B}\&gt; \overline{C} + AB\overline{C}$</span><br /></p>
<p>What is the minimum requirement for a POS expression to be equal to 0? Take the following POS expression, for instance:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$(A + B + C)(A + \overline{B} + C)(\overline{A} + B + C)$</span><br /></p>
<p>At the very least, what has to occur in order for this expression to equal 0?</p>
<p>At least one of the sum terms must be equal to zero.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: in order for one of these terms to be equal to zero, thus making the whole expression equal to zero, what must be true about each of the Boolean literals (a <em>literal</em> is either a variable or the complement of a variable) within at least one of the sum terms?</p>
<p>This question foreshadows the derivation of POS expressions from truth tables. It also parallels the subject of polynomial roots in real-number algebra. For instance, the polynomial <span class="math"><em>x</em><sup>2</sup> − 2<em>x</em> − 8</span> may be factored as such:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">(<em>x</em> − 4)(<em>x</em> + 2)</span><br /></p>
<p>If we were to set this equation equal to zero, the <em>roots</em> of the equation would be 4 and -2: the values for <span class="math"><em>x</em></span> which would make either one of the terms equal to zero.</p>
