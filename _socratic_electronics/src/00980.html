<p>Explain the effect that compensation capacitance has on an operational amplifierâ€™s gain-bandwidth product (GBW). Does a larger compensation capacitance yield a greater GBW or a lesser GBW, and why?</p>
<p>The greater the amount of compensation capacitance in an op-amp (either internal, or externally connected), the less the GBW product.</p>
<p>In this question, the really important aspect is not the answer given. What is important here is that students understand what GBW product is, and how it is affected by this thing we call &quot;compensation capacitance&quot; (another topic of research). The goal here is to get students to research these concepts and relate them together, so please do not be satisfied with any student answers that merely restate the answer given here! Ask students to explain what these terms and concepts mean, and to explain <em>why</em> the GBW product decreases with increased <span class="math"><em>C</em><sub><em>c</em><em>o</em><em>m</em><em>p</em></sub></span>.</p>
