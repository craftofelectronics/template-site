<p>Explain why amplifier circuits are often designed and built with multiple stages. Why not just build every amplifier circuit with a single transistor? Would that not be a simpler approach?</p>
<p>Multi-stage amplifiers provide greater gains (voltage, current, and/or power) than what could be accomplished through single stage designs alone.</p>
