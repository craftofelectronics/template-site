<p>Determine the frequency of a waveform having a period of 1.4 milliseconds (1.4 ms).</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>f</em> = </span> 714.29 Hz</p>
<p>It is important for students to realize the reciprocal relationship between frequency and period. One is <em>cycles per second</em> while the other is <em>seconds per cycle</em>.</p>
