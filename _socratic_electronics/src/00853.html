<p>A quantity sometimes used in DC circuits is <em>conductance</em>, symbolized by the letter <span class="math"><em>G</em></span>. Conductance is the reciprocal of resistance (<span class="math">$G = {1 \over R}$</span>), and it is measured in the unit of siemens.</p>
<p>Expressing the values of resistors in terms of conductance instead of resistance has certain benefits in parallel circuits. Whereas resistances (<span class="math"><em>R</em></span>) add in series and &quot;diminish&quot; in parallel (with a somewhat complex equation), conductances (<span class="math"><em>G</em></span>) add in parallel and &quot;diminish&quot; in series. Thus, doing the math for series circuits is easier using resistance and doing math for parallel circuits is easier using conductance:</p>

<p>In AC circuits, we also have reciprocal quantities to reactance (<span class="math"><em>X</em></span>) and impedance (<span class="math"><em>Z</em></span>). The reciprocal of reactance is called <em>susceptance</em> (<span class="math">$B = {1 \over X}$</span>), and the reciprocal of impedance is called <em>admittance</em> (<span class="math">$Y = {1 \over Z}$</span>). Like conductance, both these reciprocal quantities are measured in units of siemens.</p>
<p>Write an equation that solves for the admittance (<span class="math"><em>Y</em></span>) of this parallel circuit. The equation need not solve for the phase angle between voltage and current, but merely provide a scalar figure for admittance (in siemens):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00853x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math">$Y_{total} = \sqrt{G^2 + B^2}$</span></p>
<p>Follow-up question #1: draw a phasor diagram showing how <span class="math"><em>Y</em></span>, <span class="math"><em>G</em></span>, and <span class="math"><em>B</em></span> relate.</p>
<p>Follow-up question #2: re-write this equation using quantities of resistance (<span class="math"><em>R</em></span>), reactance (<span class="math"><em>X</em></span>), and impedance (<span class="math"><em>Z</em></span>), instead of conductance (<span class="math"><em>G</em></span>), susceptance (<span class="math"><em>B</em></span>), and admittance (<span class="math"><em>Y</em></span>).</p>
<p>Ask your students if this equation looks familiar to them. It should!</p>
<p>The answer to the second follow-up question is a matter of algebraic substitution. Work through this process with your students, and then ask them to compare the resulting equation with other equations theyâ€™ve seen before. Does its form look familiar to them in any way?</p>
