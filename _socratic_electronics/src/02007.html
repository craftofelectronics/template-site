<p>A technician builds a simple half-wave rectifier circuit for a project, but is surprised to find that the diode keeps failing:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02007x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>This comes as a surprise because the diode has a repetitive peak reverse voltage rating of 50 volts, which the technician knows is greater than the peak voltage output by the step-down transformer. However, the technician has overlooked something very important in this circuit design. Explain what the problem is, and how to solve it.</p>
<p>The diode’s peak inverse voltage (&quot;PIV&quot;) rating is insufficient. It needs to be about 85 volts or greater in order to withstand the demands of this circuit.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: suggest a part number for a diode capable of withstanding the reverse voltage generated by this circuit, and able to handle at least 1 amp of continuous current.</p>
<p>If students experience difficulty calculating the necessary PIV rating for this circuit’s diode, ask them to analyze the peak output from the transformer’s secondary winding <em>for each half-cycle of the AC waveform</em>, noting the voltage drops across all circuit components. Once a full-cycle voltage analysis is performed for all circuit components, the necessary diode rating should become obvious.</p>
<p>Though it may not be obvious at first reading, this question may actually serve as a lead-in for discussing voltage multiplier circuits. The fact that the diode experiences a reverse voltage <em>twice</em> that of the peak AC voltage is something we may exploit!</p>
<p>Another reliability factor most students won’t recognize in this circuit is the &quot;inrush&quot; current experienced by the diode every time the circuit is powered up and the capacitor recharges. Certainly, the diode was not properly rated for the reverse voltage it was being subjected to, but this might not be the only form of abuse! If time permits, discuss this possibility as well.</p>
