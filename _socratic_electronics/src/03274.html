<p>Calculate the necessary magnetic flux rate-of-change over time (in units of Webers per second) as well as the direction of magnet motion (either toward or away from the coil) to induce a voltage of 13.5 volts in the polarity shown:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03274x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math">$d \phi \over dt$</span> must be equal to 0.0964 Webers per second, with the magnet moving away from the coil.</p>
<p>This question is both a quantitative application of Faraday’s Law and an application of Lenz’s Law.</p>
