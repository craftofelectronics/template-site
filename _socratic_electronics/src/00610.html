<p>A capacitor has been connected in parallel with the solenoid coil to minimize arcing of the switch contacts when opened:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00610x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The only problem with this solution is, resonance between the capacitor and the solenoid coil’s inductance is causing an oscillating voltage (commonly known as <em>ringing</em>) to appear across the terminals of each. This high-frequency &quot;ringing&quot; is generating bursts of radio interference whenever the switch contacts open. Radio interference is not good.</p>
<p>You know that the underlying cause of this &quot;ringing&quot; is resonance, yet you cannot simply remove the capacitor from the circuit because you know that will result in decreased operating life for the switch contacts, as the solenoid’s inductive &quot;kickback&quot; will cause excessive arcing. How do you overcome this problem without creating another problem?</p>
<p>Like many realistic problems, there is more than one possible solution. One way to approach this problem is to think of an analogous situation, and how the same type of problem was solved by someone else in that context. For example, how do automotive engineers solve the problem of mechanical resonance destabilizing a vehicle after it runs over a bump in the road? What did they invent to dampen the natural &quot;bouncing&quot; of the vehicle’s suspension system, without defeating the purpose of the suspension system altogether? And how might you apply this principle to an electric circuit?</p>
<p>Follow-up question: besides shortening the life of the switch, what other undesirable effects can switch &quot;arcing&quot; have? Can you think of any scenarios where an arcing switch could pose a safety hazard?</p>
<p>Besides posing a practical problem-solving scenario to students, this question is a good lead-in to the topic of <em>antiresonance</em>. Be sure to allow plenty of class discussion time for this question, as many topics are likely to be covered as students discuss alternative problem-solving strategies.</p>
