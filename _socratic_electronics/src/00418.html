<p>Explain the difference between a <em>balanced</em> polyphase system and an <em>unbalanced</em> polyphase system. What conditions typically cause a polyphase system to become unbalanced?</p>
<p>A &quot;balanced&quot; polyphase system is one where all line voltages are equal to each other, and all line currents are also equal to each other. &quot;Unbalanced&quot; conditions usually stem from unsymmetrical loads, although severe imbalances may be caused by faults in the system.</p>
<p>Ask your students which type of three-phase system (balanced or unbalanced) is easier to analyze, and why that is so.</p>
