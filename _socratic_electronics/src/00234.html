<p>Sometimes, terminal blocks also go by the name of &quot;barrier strips.&quot;</p>
<p>Be sure to have a variety of terminal blocks available for your students to see and touch during discussion time. Terminal blocks are widely used in industrial applications, for making permanent and semi-permanent connections.</p>
