<p>Identify which of these components are connected directly in series with each other, and which are connected directly in parallel with each other:</p>

<p>Assume that the open wire ends are connection points to a power source.</p>
<p>R2 in parallel with R3.</p>
<p>R1 in series with R2.</p>
<p>R2 in series with R3.</p>
<p>R1 in series with R2; R3 in series with R4.</p>
<p>R1 in parallel with R3; R2 in parallel with R4.</p>
<p>R1 in series with R2.</p>
<p>Work with your students to clearly identify rules by which series and parallel connections may be identified. This is extremely important for students to grasp if they are to be successful analyzing series-parallel networks of any kind. The most common problems I encounter as an electronics instructor with reference to series-parallel are invariably related to studentsâ€™ lack of ability to consistently distinguish series sub-networks and parallel sub-networks in series-parallel combination circuits.</p>
