<p>Calculate the approximate amount of current this current mirror circuit will try to maintain through <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>l</em><em>o</em><em>a</em><em>d</em></sub></span>, assuming silicon transistors (0.7 volts forward base-emitter junction drop):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02432x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math"><em>I</em><sub><em>l</em><em>o</em><em>a</em><em>d</em></sub> ≈ </span> 6.5 mA</p>
<p>Follow-up question: what would have to be changed in this circuit to increase the amount of current through the load resistor without changing the power supply voltage?</p>
<p>Ask your students to explain how they obtained the answer to this question, step by step.</p>
