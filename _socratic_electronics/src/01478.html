<p>Design a circuit that adds two binary bits together. This circuit will have two inputs (<span class="math"><em>A</em></span> and <span class="math"><em>B</em></span>) and two outputs (Sum and Carry):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01478x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Begin the design process by drawing a truth table for the circuit, then determining the necessary gate circuitry to fulfill each output function.</p>
<p>Why is this circuit referred to as a <em>half adder</em>? How would a <em>full</em> adder circuit differ from this?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01478x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Have your students explain their design process to you, step by step. This circuit diagram is easy enough to discover in the pages of a textbook, so donâ€™t be surprised if students simply copy what they see without trying to understand how it works!</p>
