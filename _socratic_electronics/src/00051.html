<p>How is it possible to assign a fixed value of voltage or current (such as &quot;120 volts&quot;) to an AC electrical quantity that is constantly changing, crossing 0 volts, and reversing polarity?</p>
<p>We may express quantities of AC voltage and current in terms of <em>peak</em>, <em>peak-to-peak</em>, <em>average</em>, or <em>RMS</em>.</p>
<p>Before you discuss &quot;RMS&quot; values with your students, it is important to cover the basic idea of how to assign fixed values to quantities that change over time. Since AC waveforms are <em>cyclic</em> (repeating), this is not as difficult to do as one might think.</p>
