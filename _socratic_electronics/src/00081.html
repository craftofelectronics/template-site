<p>Explain, step by step, how to calculate the amount of current (<span class="math"><em>I</em></span>) that will go through the resistor in this circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00081x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Resistor current = 0.02553 amps, or 25.53 milliamps (mA).</p>
<p>Just a simple Ohm’s Law calculation here – no tricks! The point of this question, however, is to get students to think about the steps they follow in doing the calculation. Many students simply wish to memorize procedures rather than learn <em>why</em> to do what they need to do to answer such questions. It is your task as the instructor to challenge them beyond memorization, and through to understanding.</p>
