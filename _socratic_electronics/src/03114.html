<p>The <em>Pythagorean Theorem</em> is used to calculate the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle given the lengths of the other two sides:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03114x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Manipulate the standard form of the Pythagorean Theorem to produce a version that solves for the length of <span class="math"><em>A</em></span> given <span class="math"><em>B</em></span> and <span class="math"><em>C</em></span>, and also write a version of the equation that solves for the length of <span class="math"><em>B</em></span> given <span class="math"><em>A</em></span> and <span class="math"><em>C</em></span>.</p>
<p>Standard form of the Pythagorean Theorem:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$C = \sqrt{A^2 + B^2}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Solving for <span class="math"><em>A</em></span>:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$A = \sqrt{C^2 - B^2}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Solving for <span class="math"><em>B</em></span>:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$B = \sqrt{C^2 - A^2}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The Pythagorean Theorem is easy enough for students to find on their own that you should not need to show them. A memorable illustration of this theorem are the side lengths of a so-called <em>3-4-5</em> triangle. Donâ€™t be surprised if this is the example many students choose to give.</p>
