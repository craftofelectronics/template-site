<p>In this circuit, is the light bulb lit? Why or why not?</p>
<p>Also, compare the relative indications of the two ammeters (which ammeter registers the greatest amount of current, and which ammeter registers the least amount of current, or do they both register the same amount of current?).</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00023x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The bulb is not lit, and the two ammeters both register 0 amperes of current.</p>
<p>It is vitally important for students to understand the significance of continuity throughout the entire circuit, not just at one or more points in the circuit.</p>
