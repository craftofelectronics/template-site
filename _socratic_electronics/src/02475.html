<p>Determine the type (LP, HP, BP, BS) and cutoff frequency of this active filter circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02475x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>This is a high-pass filter circuit.</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>f</em><sub> − 3<em>d</em><em>B</em></sub></span> = 482.3 Hz</p>
<p>Follow-up question: the feedback resistor network comprised of the 52 k<span class="math">Ω </span> and 91 k<span class="math">Ω </span> resistors not only provides a gain of 1.75 (4.86 dB), but these values were also intentionally chosen to compensate for the effects of DC bias current through the opamp input terminals. You will notice that the <em>parallel</em> combination of 52 k<span class="math">Ω </span> and 91 k<span class="math">Ω </span> is approximately equal to 33 k<span class="math">Ω </span>. Explain why this is significant with reference to the Superposition theorem.</p>
<p>Ask your students to explain how they arrived at their answers: what formulae did they use, and how did they determine the type of the filter circuit that this is? Ask them if there was any information given in the diagram irrelevant to either determination.</p>
