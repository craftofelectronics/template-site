<p>What is the overall voltage gain of two cascaded amplifiers (the output of the first amplifier going into the input of the second), each with an individual voltage gain of 3 dB? Express the overall voltage gain in decibels, and also as a ratio.</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>A</em><sub><em>V</em>(<em>f</em><em>i</em><em>n</em><em>a</em><em>l</em>)</sub> = </span> 6 dB, or a ratio of 2.825:1</p>
<p>Ask your students to convert the figure of 3 dB (voltage gain) into a ratio. How does this ratio compare with the overall ratio for the two cascaded amplifiers? What do the figures indicate about cascaded gains in general, expressed in decibel form as well as ratio form? Ask your students if they think it is mathematically easier to compute cascaded gains in ratio form or decibel, and why.</p>
