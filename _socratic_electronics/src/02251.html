<p>The following circuit is useful as a <em>current regulator</em>, the regulated current setpoint being established by the value of the resistor and the JFETâ€™s <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>G</em><em>S</em>(<em>o</em><em>f</em><em>f</em>)</sub></span> parameter:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02251x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Despite wide variations in <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>D</em><em>D</em></sub></span>, the current in this circuit will remain relatively constant. The reason this circuit works as it does is <em>negative feedback</em>. Explain what causes negative feedback to occur in this circuit, and why it has a stabilizing effect on the current.</p>
<p>The resistor creates a voltage drop that tries to pinch off the JFET as current increases. To put it in colloquial terms, &quot;when the current <em>zigs</em>, the JFET <em>zags</em>.&quot;</p>
<p>This is a simple example of negative feedback in action: one that does not require any AC analysis and all its associated considerations. Here it is just DC at work, and the students must determine what it is the JFET/resistor combination does in response to attempted changes in current that makes the current so stable.</p>
