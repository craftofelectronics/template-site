<p>Identify which of these components are connected directly in series with each other, and which are connected directly in parallel with each other:</p>

<p>Connected directly in series: <em>Battery and R1</em>.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00031x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Connected directly in parallel: <em>Lamp, C1, and D1</em></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00031x03.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Students must have a firm understanding of what constitutes &quot;series&quot; versus &quot;parallel&quot; in real circuits. Here is a place where some students will feel uncomfortable because the textbook definitions they memorized are easier said than applied. It is imperative that students have a strong working knowledge of terms, and do not simply memorize definitions.</p>
