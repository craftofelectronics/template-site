<p>What is the purpose of the <em>switch</em> shown in this schematic diagram?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00013x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>This device is known as a <em>switch</em>, and its purpose in this circuit is to establish or interrupt the electrical continuity of the circuit in order to control the light bulb.</p>
<p>Beginning students often find the terminology for switches confusing, because the words <em>open</em> and <em>closed</em> sound similar to the terminology used for doors, but do not mean quite the same thing when used in reference to a switch! In order to help avoid confusion, ask the students how they may think of these terms in a way that is consistent with their meaning in the context of an electrical switch.</p>
<p>One analogy to use for the switchâ€™s function that makes sense with the schematic is a drawbridge: when the bridge is down (closed), cars may cross; when the bridge is up (open), cars cannot.</p>
