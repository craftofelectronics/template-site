<p>Explain the operating principle of this analog-to-digital converter circuit, usually referred to as a <em>tracking</em> converter:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{04014x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The binary counter will count up or down as necessary to &quot;track&quot; the analog input voltage, resulting in a binary output that continuously represents the input.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: this form of ADC is not very effective at following fast-changing input signals. Explain why.</p>
<p>Have your students express the answer to this question in their own words, not just copying the answer I provide. Aside from the flash converter, the tracking converter is one of the easiest ADC circuits to understand.</p>
