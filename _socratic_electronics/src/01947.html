<p>Use circuit simulation software to verify your predicted and measured parameter values.</p>
<p>Use a variable-voltage, regulated power supply to supply any amount of DC voltage below 30 volts. Specify standard resistor values, all between 1 k<span class="math">Ω </span> and 100 k<span class="math">Ω </span> (1k5, 2k2, 2k7, 3k3, 4k7, 5k1, 6k8, 10k, 22k, 33k, 39k 47k, 68k, etc.).</p>
<p>This circuit produces nice, sharp-edged square wave signals at the transistor collector terminals when resistors <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>4</sub></span> are substantially smaller than resistors <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>3</sub></span>. This way, <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>3</sub></span> dominate the capacitors’ charging times, making calculation of duty cycle much more accurate. Component values I’ve used with success are 470 <span class="math">Ω </span> for <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>4</sub></span>, 270 k<span class="math">Ω </span> for <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>3</sub></span>, 4.7 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>F for <span class="math"><em>C</em><sub>1</sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>C</em><sub>2</sub></span>, and 6 to 14 volts for <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>C</em><em>C</em></sub></span>. The frequency of this circuit <em>does</em> vary with supply voltage, so don’t expect perfect agreement between predicted and measured values.</p>
<p>By the way, this circuit works very well for holiday flashing lights – decorate your lab room accordingly with student-built light flashers!</p>
<p>An extension of this exercise is to incorporate troubleshooting questions. Whether using this exercise as a performance assessment or simply as a concept-building lab, you might want to follow up your students’ results by asking them to predict the consequences of certain circuit faults.</p>
