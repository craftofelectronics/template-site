<p>Determine the output pulses for this counter circuit, known as a <em>Johnson counter</em>, assuming that all <span class="math"><em>Q</em></span> outputs begin in the low state:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01427x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01427x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01427x03.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Follow-up question: if used as a frequency divider, what is the input:output ratio of this circuit? How difficult would it be to design a Johnson counter with a different division ratio?</p>
<p>Discuss with your students how Johnson counters are quite different from binary-sequence counters, and how this uniqueness allows certain counting functions to be implemented much easier (using fewer gates) than other types of counter circuits.</p>
