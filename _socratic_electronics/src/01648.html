<p>Use circuit simulation software to verify your predicted and measured parameter values.</p>
<p>I recommend choosing resistor and capacitor values that yield time constants in the range that may be accurately tracked with a stopwatch. I also recommend using resistor values significantly less than the voltmeter’s input impedance, so that voltmeter loading does not significantly contribute to the decay rate.</p>
<p>Good time values to use (<span class="math"><em>t</em><sub>1</sub></span>, <span class="math"><em>t</em><sub>2</sub></span>, <span class="math"><em>t</em><sub>3</sub></span>) would be in the range of 5, 10, and 15 seconds, respectively.</p>
<p>An extension of this exercise is to incorporate troubleshooting questions. Whether using this exercise as a performance assessment or simply as a concept-building lab, you might want to follow up your students’ results by asking them to predict the consequences of certain circuit faults.</p>
