<p>Filter circuits don’t just attenuate signals, they also shift the phase of signals. Calculate the amount of phase shift that these two filter circuits impart to their signals (from input to output) operating at the cutoff frequency:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03785x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>HP filter: <span class="math">Θ </span> = +45<span class="math">$^{o}$</span> (<span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>o</em><em>u</em><em>t</em></sub></span> leads <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>i</em><em>n</em></sub></span>)</p>
<p>LP filter: <span class="math">Θ </span> = -45<span class="math">$^{o}$</span> (<span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>o</em><em>u</em><em>t</em></sub></span> lags <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>i</em><em>n</em></sub></span>)</p>
<p>Note that no component values are given in this question, only the condition that both circuits are operating at the cutoff frequency. This may cause trouble for some students, because they are only comfortable with numerical calculations. The structure of this question forces students to think a bit differently than they might be accustomed to.</p>
