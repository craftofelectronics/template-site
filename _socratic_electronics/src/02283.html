<p>This is a schematic for a very simple VCO:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02283x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The oscillator is of the &quot;Colpitts&quot; design. The key to understanding this circuitâ€™s operation is knowing how the <em>varactor</em> diode responds to different amounts of DC bias voltage. Explain how this circuit works, especially how the diode exerts control over the oscillation frequency. Why does the output frequency vary as the control voltage varies? Does the output frequency increase or decrease as the control voltage input receives a more positive voltage?</p>
<p>Note: &quot;RFC&quot; is an acronym standing for <em>Radio-Frequency Choke</em>, an iron-core inductor whose purpose it is to block radio frequency current from passing through.</p>
<p>As voltage across the varactor diode changes, its capacitance changes.</p>
<p>The output frequency <em>increases</em> as the control voltage becomes more positive.</p>
<p>This question is a good review of varactor diode function, as well as frequency modulation theory.</p>
