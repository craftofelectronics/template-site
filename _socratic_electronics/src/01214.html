<p>Calculate the operating frequency of this oscillator circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01214x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Explain why the operating frequency will not be the same if the transistor receives its feedback signal from the other side of the bridge, like this:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01214x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math">$f = 159.155 \hbox{ Hz}$</span></p>
<p>If the feedback signal comes from the other side of the bridge, the feedback signal’s phase shift will be determined by a different set of components (primarily, the coupling capacitors and bias network resistances) rather than the reactive arms of the bridge.</p>
<p>Given the phase shift requirements of a two-stage oscillator circuit such as this, some students may wonder why the circuit won’t act the same in the second configuration. If such confusion exists, clarify the concept with a question: &quot;What is the phase relationship between input and output voltages for the bridge in these two configurations, over a wide range of frequencies?&quot; From this observation, your students should be able to tell that only one of these configurations will be stable at 159.155 Hz.</p>
