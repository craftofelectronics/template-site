<p>What is meant by the word <em>resolution</em> in reference to an ADC or a DAC? Why is resolution important to us, and how may it be calculated for any particular circuit knowing the number of binary bits?</p>
<p>The <em>resolution</em> of either a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) or an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is the measure of how <em>finely</em> its output may change between discrete, binary steps. For instance, an 8-bit DAC with an output voltage range of 0 to 10 volts will have a resolution of 39.22 mV.</p>
<p>Note that I did not hint how to calculate the resolution of a DAC or an ADC, I just gave the answer for a particular example. The goal here is for students to inductively &quot;work backwards&quot; from my example to a general mathematical statement about resolution.</p>
<p>There are actually two different ways to calculate the resolution, depending on the actual range of the converter circuit. For the answer given, I assumed that a digital value of 0x00 = 0.00 volts DC and that a digital value of 0xFF = 10.00 volts DC. If a student were to calculate the resolution for a circuit where 0xFF generated an output voltage just shy of 10.00 volts DC (e.g. an R-2R ladder network where <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>r</em><em>e</em><em>f</em></sub></span> = 10 volts DC, and a full-scale binary input generates an output voltage just one step less than <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>r</em><em>e</em><em>f</em></sub></span>), the correct answer for resolution would be 39.06 mV.</p>
<p>You may want to bring up such practical examples of resolution as the difference between a handheld digital multimeter and a lab-bench digital multimeter. The number of digits on the display is a sure clue to a substantial difference in ADC resolution.</p>
