<p>Electrical capacitance has a close mechanical analogy: <em>elasticity</em>. Explain what the term &quot;elasticity&quot; means for a mechanical spring, and how the quantities of velocity and force applied to a spring are respectively analogous to current and voltage applied to a capacitance.</p>
<p>As a spring is compressed at a constant velocity, the amount of reaction force it generates increases at a linear rate:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$v = {1 \over k}{dF \over dt}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Where,</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>v</em> = </span> Velocity of spring compression</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>k</em> = </span> Spring &quot;stiffness&quot; constant</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>F</em> = </span> Reaction force generated by the spring’s compression</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>t</em> = </span> Time</p>
<p>In a similar manner, a pure capacitance experiencing a constant current will exhibit a constant rate of voltage change over time:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$i = C{de \over dt}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Note to your students that spring stiffness (<span class="math"><em>k</em></span>) and capacitance (<span class="math"><em>C</em></span>) are inversely proportional to one another in this analogy.</p>
<p>Explain to your students how the similarities between inertia and capacitance are so close, that capacitors can be used to electrically model mechanical springs!</p>
