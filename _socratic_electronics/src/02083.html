<p>Use the &quot;impedance triangle&quot; to calculate the necessary reactance of this series combination of resistance (<span class="math"><em>R</em></span>) and inductive reactance (<span class="math"><em>X</em></span>) to produce the desired total impedance of 145 <span class="math">Ω </span>:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02083x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Explain what equation(s) you use to calculate <span class="math"><em>X</em></span>, and the algebra necessary to achieve this result from a more common formula.</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>X</em></span> = 105 <span class="math">Ω </span>, as calculated by an algebraically manipulated version of the Pythagorean Theorem.</p>
<p>Be sure to have students show you the form of the Pythagorean Theorem, rather than showing them yourself, since it is so easy for students to research on their own.</p>
