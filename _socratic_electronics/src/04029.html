<p>Determine what sort of time-delay relay this circuit is:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{04029x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Also, calculate the amount of delay, in seconds. Hint: the 555’s timing capacitor will charge from 0 volts to <span class="math">$2 \over 3$</span> supply voltage during the charging cycle.</p>
<p>This is a <em>normally-open, timed-closed</em> (also known as a <em>normally-open, on-delay</em>) relay, with a time delay of 4.065 seconds.</p>
<p>Some students may mistakenly base their time calculations on the 10 k<span class="math">Ω </span> resistor and/or the 0.1 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>F capacitor. Discuss the role of these two components in triggering the 555 timer, and how the time delay of the relay is actually set by the <em>other</em> <span class="math"><em>R</em></span> and <span class="math"><em>C</em></span>.</p>
