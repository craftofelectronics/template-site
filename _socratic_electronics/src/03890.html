<p>Predict how the operation of this astable 555 timer circuit will be affected as a result of the following faults. Specifically, identify what will happen to the capacitor voltage (<span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>C</em>1</sub></span>) and the output voltage (<span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>o</em><em>u</em><em>t</em></sub></span>) for each fault condition. Consider each fault independently (i.e. one at a time, no multiple faults):</p>

<p><span class="math"> • </span> Resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> fails open:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Solder bridge (short) across resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span>:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span> fails open:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Solder bridge (short) across resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span>:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Capacitor <span class="math"><em>C</em><sub>1</sub></span> fails shorted:</p>
<p>For each of these conditions, explain <em>why</em> the resulting effects will occur.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> fails open: <em>Capacitor voltage holds at last value, output voltage holds at last value.</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Solder bridge (short) across resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span>: <em>Timer IC will become damaged at the first discharge cycle.</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span> fails open: <em>Capacitor voltage holds at last value, output voltage holds at last value.</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Solder bridge (short) across resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span>: <em>Oscillation frequency nearly doubles, and the duty cycle increases to nearly 100%.</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Capacitor <span class="math"><em>C</em><sub>1</sub></span> fails shorted: <em>Capacitor voltage goes to 0 volts DC, output voltage stays &quot;high&quot;.</em></p>
<p>The purpose of this question is to approach the domain of circuit troubleshooting from a perspective of knowing what the fault is, rather than only knowing what the symptoms are. Although this is not necessarily a realistic perspective, it helps students build the foundational knowledge necessary to diagnose a faulted circuit from empirical data. Questions such as this should be followed (eventually) by other questions asking students to identify likely faults based on measurements.</p>
