<p>The ignition system of a gasoline-powered internal combustion automobile engine is an example of a transformer operated on DC by means of an oscillating switch contact, commonly referred to as the contact &quot;points&quot;:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00447x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The cam-actuated &quot;point&quot; contacts open every time a spark is needed to ignite the air-fuel mixture in one of the engine’s cylinders. Naturally, these contacts suffer a substantial amount of wear over time due to the amount of current they must make and break, and the frequency of their cycling.</p>
<p>This device was seen by automotive engineers as a prime candidate for replacement with solid-state technology (i.e., a transistor). If a transistor could take the place of mechanical &quot;point&quot; contacts for making and breaking the ignition coil’s current, it should result in increased service life.</p>
<p>Insert a transistor into the following circuit in such a way that it controls the ignition coil’s current, with the &quot;point&quot; contacts merely controlling the transistor’s state (turning it on and off):</p>

<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00447x03.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Follow-up question: assuming the primary winding of the &quot;coil&quot; has an inductance of 9 mH an a wire resistance of 0.4 <span class="math">Ω </span>, determine the amount of time necessary to build to full current once the transistor or points have turned on (after 5 time constants’ worth of time).</p>
<p>Ask your students, &quot;what is the purpose of the capacitor in this circuit?&quot; Inform them that without it, the points would have &quot;burned up&quot; very quickly, and that the transistor will fail almost immediately!</p>
<p>Some of your students familiar with engine ignition systems will notice that there is no distributor for multiple spark plugs. In other words, this circuit is for a single-cylinder engine! I chose not to draw a distributor in this schematic just to keep things simple.</p>
