<p>You will receive the highest score for which <em>all</em> criteria are met.</p>
<p><em>(Must meet or exceed all criteria listed)</em></p>
<p>A. Absolutely flawless procedure</p>
<p>B. No unnecessary actions or measurements taken</p>
<p><em>(Must meet or exceed these criteria in addition to all criteria for 85% and below)</em></p>
<p>A. No reversals in procedure (i.e. changing mind without sufficient evidence)</p>
<p>B. Every single action, measurement, and relevant observation properly documented</p>
<p><em>(Must meet or exceed these criteria in addition to all criteria for 75% and below)</em></p>
<p>A. No more than one unnecessary action or measurement</p>
<p>B. No false conclusions or conceptual errors</p>
<p>C. No missing conclusions (i.e. at least one documented conclusion for action / measurement / observation)</p>
<p><em>(Must meet or exceed these criteria in addition to all criteria for 65%)</em></p>
<p>A. No more than one false conclusion or conceptual error</p>
<p>B. No more than one conclusion missing (i.e. an action, measurement, or relevant observation without a corresponding conclusion)</p>
<p><em>(Must meet or exceed these criteria in addition to all criteria for 60%)</em></p>
<p>A. No more than two false conclusions or conceptual errors</p>
<p>B. No more than two unnecessary actions or measurements</p>
<p>C. No more than one undocumented action, measurement, or relevant observation</p>
<p>D. Proper use of all test equipment</p>
<p><em>(Must meet or exceed these criteria)</em></p>
<p>A. Fault accurately identified</p>
<p>B. Safe procedures used at all times</p>
<p><em>(Only applicable where students performed significant development/design work – i.e. not a proven circuit provided with all component values)</em></p>
<p>A. Working prototype circuit built and demonstrated</p>
<p><em>(If of the following conditions are true)</em></p>
<p>A. Unsafe procedure(s) used at any point</p>
<p>Be sure to document all steps taken and conclusions made in your troubleshooting!</p>
<p>The purpose of this assessment rubric is to act as a sort of “contract” between you (the instructor) and your student. This way, the expectations are all clearly known in advance, which goes a long way toward disarming problems later when it is time to grade.</p>
