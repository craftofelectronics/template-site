<p>Calculate the amount of power delivered to the load resistor in this circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01724x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Also, calculate the amount of power that would be delivered to the load resistor if the wires were superconducting (<span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>w</em><em>i</em><em>r</em><em>e</em></sub> = 0. 0 Ω </span>).</p>
<p><span class="math">$P_{load} \approx 170 \hbox{ Watts (with resistive wire)}$</span></p>
<p><span class="math">$P_{load} = 180 \hbox{ Watts (with superconducting wire)}$</span></p>
<p>Follow-up question: Compare the direction of current through all components in this circuit with the polarities of their respective voltage drops. What do you notice about the relationship between current direction and voltage polarity for the battery, versus for all the resistors? How does this relate to the identification of these components as either <em>sources</em> or <em>loads</em>?</p>
<p>Not only is this question good practice for series circuit calculations (Ohm’s and Joule’s Laws), but it also introduces superconductors in a practical context.</p>
