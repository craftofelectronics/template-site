<p>Identify the function of this active filter:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00709x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>It is low pass, high pass, band pass, or band stop? Explain your answer.</p>
<p>This is a band stop filter circuit.</p>
<p>Challenge question: how much voltage gain does this amplifier have at resonance? How much voltage gain does it have at <span class="math"><em>f</em> = 0</span> and <span class="math"><em>f</em> = ∞</span>, if the two resistor values are equal?</p>
<p>If some students have difficulty analyzing the function of this circuit, ask them to identify the total impedance of a series-connected inductor and capacitor at resonance, then transfer that amount of impedance to the circuit to see what the effects will be at the resonant frequency.</p>
