<p>Suppose an electric current of 1.5 microamps (1.5 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>A) were to go through a resistance of 2.3 mega-ohms (2.3 M<span class="math">Ω </span>). How much voltage would be &quot;dropped&quot; across this resistance? Show your work in calculating the answer.</p>
<p><span class="math">1. 5 × 10<sup> − 6</sup></span> amps of current through a resistance of <span class="math">2. 3 × 10<sup>6</sup></span> <span class="math">Ω </span> will produce a voltage &quot;drop&quot; equal to 3.45 volts.</p>
<p>It is important for students to understand that metric prefixes are nothing more than &quot;shorthand&quot; forms of scientific notation, with each prefix corresponding to a specific power-of-ten.</p>
