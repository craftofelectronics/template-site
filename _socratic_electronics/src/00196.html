<p>How are <em>electrolytic</em> capacitors constructed, and what is particularly noteworthy about their use?</p>
<p>&quot;Electrolytic&quot; capacitors use a very thin layer of metal oxide as the dielectric. The manufacturing process involves applying a DC voltage to the new capacitor to create the oxide layer. This &quot;polarizes&quot; it for life, preventing its use with reverse polarity.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: identify the schematic symbol for any type of polarized capacitor, electrolytics included.</p>
<p>There are many features of electrolytic capacitors unique to that type, not the least of which being their means of manufacture. Since these capacitors are used so often for low-voltage electronic applications, it is well worth the studentsâ€™ time to study them well and know their idiosyncrasies.</p>
