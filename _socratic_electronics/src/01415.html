<p>Suppose a crane has fifteen hydraulic solenoid valves controlling its motion:</p>

<p>You are part of a team building a remote &quot;pendant&quot; control for this crane with fifteen buttons on it for controlling each of the fifteen solenoid valves. This control pendant connects to the main system by a multiconductor cable, but you really want to limit the number of conductors in this cable to keep it as light-weight as possible:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01415x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Draw a simple schematic diagram showing how a digital encoder and decoder circuit pair could be used to relay the same fifteen commands across fewer cable conductors, compared to if we used one conductor per pushbutton switch.</p>
<p>(Solenoid drive circuitry not shown):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01415x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Follow-up question: can you think of any disadvantages to this crane control strategy, compared to using a thicker cable where each pushbutton has its own dedicated conductor?</p>
<p>Challenge question: my choice of active-low inputs and outputs was not arbitrary. Explain why.</p>
<p>If time permits, you might want to ask students to sketch a &quot;typical&quot; solenoid drive sub-circuit, interposing the decoder outputs to DC (or AC!) solenoid valve coils. Several options are possible here, each with their own merits and drawbacks.</p>
<p>The challenge question is a good one to discuss, even if most students were not able to answer it on their own. It is not good enough to merely have a system that works – we must also have a system that is <em>safe</em>.</p>
