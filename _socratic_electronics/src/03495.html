<p>Calculate the amount of magnetic flux (<span class="math">Φ </span>) in a piece of iron with a reluctance (<span class="math">ℜ</span>) of 55 amp-turns per weber and an applied MMF (<span class="math">$\cal F$</span>) of 2.2 amp-turns.</p>
<p><span class="math">Φ </span> = 40 mWb</p>
<p>Nothing special here, just a simple calculation. One of the points of this question is to have students research Rowland’s Law and learn how to use it as they would Ohm’s Law.</p>
<p>Note that the unit abbreviation for &quot;webers&quot; contains two letters, not just one as is the case for most unit abbreviations!</p>
