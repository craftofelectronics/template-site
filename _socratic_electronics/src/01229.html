<p>If the numbers sixteen and nine are added in binary form, will the answer be any different than if the same quantities are added in decimal form? Explain.</p>
<p>No. The form of numeration used to represent numbers has no bearing on the outcome of mathematical operations.</p>
<p>Although this may seem like a trivial question, I’ve met electronics technicians who actually believed that the form of numeration affected the outcome of certain mathematical operations. In particular, I met one fellow who believed the number <span class="math"><em>π</em></span> was fundamentally different in binary form than it was in decimal form: that a binary &quot;pi&quot; was not the same quantity as a decimal &quot;pi&quot;. I challenged his belief by applying some Socratic irony:</p>
<p>How do you use a hand calculator to determine the circumference of a circle, given its diameter? For example, a circle with a diameter of 5 feet has a circumference of . . .</p>
<p>By multiplying the diameter times &quot;pi&quot;. 5 feet times &quot;pi&quot; is a little over 15 feet.</p>
<p>Does a calculator give you the correct answer?</p>
<p>Of course it does.</p>
<p>Does an electronic calculator use decimal numbers, internally, to do math?</p>
<p>No, it uses binary numbers, because its circuitry is made up of logic gates . . . <em>(long pause)</em> . . . Oh, now I see! If the type of number system mattered in doing math, digital computers and calculators would arrive at different answers for arithmetic problems than we would doing the math by hand!</p>
<p>Of course, those familiar with computer programming and numerical analysis understand that digital computers can introduce &quot;artifacts&quot; into computed results that are not mathematically correct. However, this is not due to their use of binary numeration so much as it is limited word-widths (leading to overflow conditions), algorithmic problems converting floating-point to integer and visa-versa, and such.</p>
