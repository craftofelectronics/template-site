<p>Use Thévenin’s Theorem to determine a simple equivalent circuit for the 10 volt source, the 5 k<span class="math">Ω </span> resistor, and the 2.2 k<span class="math">Ω </span> resistor; then calculate the voltage across the 1 k<span class="math">Ω </span> load:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03241x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>This exercise may seem pointless, as it is easy enough to obtain the answer simply by series-parallel analysis of this circuit. However, there is definite value in determining a Thévenin equivalent circuit for the voltage source, 5 k<span class="math">Ω </span> resistor, and 2.2 k<span class="math">Ω </span> resistor if the load voltage for <em>several different</em> values of load resistance needs to be predicted. Explain why Thévenin’s Theorem becomes the more efficient way to predict load voltage if multiple load resistor values are considered.</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>l</em><em>o</em><em>a</em><em>d</em></sub></span> = 1.209 volts</p>
<p>Ask your students to show how (step-by-step) they arrived at the equivalent circuit, prior to calculating load voltage.</p>
<p>In case students are unfamiliar with the &quot;double-chevron&quot; symbols in the schematic diagram, let them know that these represent male/female connector pairs.</p>
