<p>Trigonometric functions such as <em>sine</em>, <em>cosine</em>, and <em>tangent</em> are useful for determining the ratio of right-triangle side lengths given the value of an angle. However, they are not very useful for doing the reverse: calculating an angle given the lengths of two sides.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02086x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Suppose we wished to know the value of angle <span class="math">Θ </span>, and we happened to know the values of <span class="math"><em>Z</em></span> and <span class="math"><em>R</em></span> in this impedance triangle. We could write the following equation, but in its present form we could not solve for <span class="math">Θ </span>:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\cos \Theta = {R \over Z}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The only way we can algebraically isolate the angle <span class="math">Θ </span> in this equation is if we have some way to &quot;undo&quot; the cosine function. Once we know what function will &quot;undo&quot; cosine, we can apply it to both sides of the equation and have <span class="math">Θ </span> by itself on the left-hand side.</p>
<p>There is a class of trigonometric functions known as <em>inverse</em> or <em>&quot;arc&quot;</em> functions which will do just that: &quot;undo&quot; a regular trigonometric function so as to leave the angle by itself. Explain how we could apply an &quot;arc-function&quot; to the equation shown above to isolate <span class="math">Θ </span>.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\cos \Theta = {R \over Z} \hbox{\hskip 20pt Original equation}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\hbox{\it . . . applying the &quot;arc-cosine&quot; function to both sides . . .}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\arccos \left( \cos \Theta \right) = \arccos \left( {R \over Z} \right)$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\Theta = \arccos \left( {R \over Z} \right)$</span><br /></p>
<p>I like to show the purpose of trigonometric arcfunctions in this manner, using the cardinal rule of algebraic manipulation (do the same thing to both sides of an equation) that students are familiar with by now. This helps eliminate the mystery of arcfunctions for students new to trigonometry.</p>
