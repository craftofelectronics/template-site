<p>An automobile manufacturer needs a logic circuit to perform a specific task in its new line of cars. These cars will be equipped with a &quot;headlight left on&quot; alarm that sounds any time these two conditions are met: headlights on and ignition switch off. Draw the schematic diagram of a logic gate circuit that will implement this alarm, constructed entirely out of NAND gates.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02831x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Follow-up question: suppose the alarm unit required more current than the final NAND gate could source. Add a transistor &quot;buffer&quot; stage to the logic gate circuit to drive additional current to the alarm.</p>
<p>Challenge question: explain how the following NOR gate circuit performs the exact same logic function with fewer components:</p>

<p>This question is a really good one to ask your students <em>how</em> they arrived at a solution. It is easy enough to simply look at the given answer and repeat it, but of course the intent of this question is to get students to think how they might design such a circuit completely on their own.</p>
