<p>Some brands of dry-cell batteries come equipped with a built-in charge indicator in the form of a thermal strip along one side. Pressing two white dots closes a circuit, which heats up the strip and indicates battery charge by changing color.</p>
<p>Compare the accuracy of a charge indicator of this general design against using a voltmeter to measure open-circuit battery voltage. Which method of measurement is a more accurate indication of battery charge, and why?</p>
<p>The thermal strip charge indicator is actually a more accurate indication of battery charge than an open-circuit voltage test.</p>
<p>Challenge question: in the absence of such a &quot;charge indicator&quot; on the side of a battery, how could you perform an accurate assessment of battery charge?</p>
<p>This question is practical because Iâ€™ve seen students measure the open-circuit voltage of a battery and declare it &quot;good&quot; when it is really past the end of its useful life. This is not to say that a plain voltmeter is useless for determining battery charge. Obviously if an open-circuit voltage test yields abnormally low voltage, we know the battery is dead. The question is, under what condition(s) is a &quot;good&quot; voltage measurement a reliable indicator of adequate battery charge?</p>
