<p>What causes harmonics to form in AC electric power systems?</p>
<p>Nonlinear loads.</p>
<p>My answer to this question is intentionally vague. It is correct, but does not reveal anything about the real nature of the cause, or more importantly, <em>why</em> a &quot;nonlinear&quot; load would cause harmonics. Discuss with your students what a &quot;nonlinear&quot; device is, and what it does to a sinusoidal signal to generate harmonics.</p>
