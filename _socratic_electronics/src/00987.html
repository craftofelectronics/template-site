<p>Draw the connecting wires to form a circuit where the transistor turns the LED <em>off</em> whenever the pushbutton switch is actuated:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00987x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00987x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Ask your students to describe the biasing of the gate-channel junction inside the transistor when the switch is closed. Is this PN junction forward-biased, or reverse-biased? What does this biasing do inside the transistor to interrupt current to the LED?</p>
<p>Note that there is no resistor shown in this circuit, because many small-signal JFETs have values of <span class="math"><em>I</em><sub><em>D</em><em>S</em><em>S</em></sub></span> within the operating range of common LEDs. In other words, the JFET itself acts as a current-limiting device to protect the LED.</p>
