<p>What would we have to do in order to reverse the rotation of this three-phase induction motor?</p>

<p>Explain your answer. Describe how the (simple) solution to this problem works.</p>
<p>Reverse any two lines. This will reverse the phase sequence (from ABC to CBA).</p>
<p>One of the reasons three-phase motors are preferred in industry is the simplicity of rotation reversal. However, this is also a problem because when you connect a three-phase motor to its power source during maintenance or installation procedures, you often do not know which way it will rotate until you turn the power on!</p>
<p>Discuss with your students how an electrician might go about his or her job when installing a three-phase motor. What would be the proper lock-out/tag-out sequence, and steps to take when connecting a motor to its power source? What would have to be done if it is found the motor rotates in the wrong direction?</p>
