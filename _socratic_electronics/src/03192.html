<p>An interesting and useful property in mathematics is the <em>transitive property</em>:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\hbox{If } a = b \hbox{ and } b = c \hbox{ , then } a = c$</span><br /></p>
<p>Simply stated, two variables must be equal to one another if they are both equal to a common (third) variable. While not particularly profound or breathtaking in scope, this property is nevertheless useful in solving certain mathematical problems.</p>
<p>Suppose you were given the following two equations and asked to find solutions for <span class="math"><em>x</em></span> and <span class="math"><em>y</em></span> that will satisfy <em>both</em> at the same time:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math"><em>y</em> + <em>x</em> = 8</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math"><em>y</em> − <em>x</em> = 3</span><br /></p>
<p>Manipulate both of these equations to solve for <span class="math"><em>y</em></span>, and then explain how you could apply the transitive principle to solve for <span class="math"><em>x</em></span>.</p>
<p>If <span class="math">8 − <em>x</em> = <em>y</em></span> and <span class="math">3 + <em>x</em> = <em>y</em></span>, then <span class="math">8 − <em>x</em></span> must equal <span class="math">3 + <em>x</em></span>:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">8 − <em>x</em> = 3 + <em>x</em></span><br /></p>
<p>Solutions for <span class="math"><em>x</em></span> and <span class="math"><em>y</em></span>:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$x = 2.5 \hbox{ and } y = 5.5$</span><br /></p>
<p>This method of solving for a two-variable set of simultaneous equations is really nothing more than substitution in disguise. Some students find it easier to grasp than straight substitution, though.</p>
