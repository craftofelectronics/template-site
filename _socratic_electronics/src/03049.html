<p>The simplest types of programmable logic ICs are called PLDs (Programmable Logic Devices), PALs (Programmable Array Logic), PLAs (Programmable Logic Array), and GALs (Generic Array Logic). While each acronym represents a slightly different internal design architecture, these devices share a common feature of using inverters, AND gates, and OR gates to implement any desired combinational logic function.</p>
<p>Explain how it is possible to generate any arbitrary logic function with just these gate types (inverter, AND, OR), without any others. What principle or convention of Boolean algebra is used by these devices to do this?</p>
<p>With a sufficient number of AND, OR, and inverter gates, any SOP or POS expression may be generated.</p>
<p>This question requires students to review the principles of how SOP and POS expressions relate to truth tables, and in doing so explain how any arbitrary truth table may be fulfilled.</p>
