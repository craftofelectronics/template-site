<p>Use circuit simulation software to verify your predicted and measured parameter values.</p>
<p>Students are allowed to adjust the bias potentiometer to achieve class-A operation after calculating and inserting the resistance values <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>C</em></sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>E</em></sub></span>. However, they are not allowed to change either <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>C</em></sub></span> or <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>E</em></sub></span> once the circuit is powered and tested, lest they achieve the specified gain through trial-and-error!</p>
<p>A good percentage tolerance for gain is +/- 10%. The lower you set the target gain, the more accuracy you may expect out of your students’ circuits. I usually select random values of voltage gain between 2 and 10, and I strongly recommend that students choose resistor values between 1 k<span class="math">Ω </span> and 100 k<span class="math">Ω </span>. Resistor values much lower than 1 k<span class="math">Ω </span> lead to excessive quiescent currents, which may cause accuracy problems (<span class="math"><em>r</em>ʹ<sub><em>e</em></sub></span> drifting due to temperature effects).</p>
<p>An extension of this exercise is to incorporate troubleshooting questions. Whether using this exercise as a performance assessment or simply as a concept-building lab, you might want to follow up your students’ results by asking them to predict the consequences of certain circuit faults.</p>
