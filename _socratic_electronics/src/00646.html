<p>Calculate the power dissipated by this circuit’s load at two different source frequencies: 0 Hz (DC), and <span class="math"><em>f</em><sub><em>c</em><em>u</em><em>t</em><em>o</em><em>f</em><em>f</em></sub></span>.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00646x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>What do these figures tell you about the nature of this filter circuit (whether it is a low-pass or a high-pass filter), and also about the definition of <em>cutoff frequency</em> (also referred to as <span class="math"><em>f</em><sub> − 3<em>d</em><em>B</em></sub></span>)?</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>P</em><sub><em>l</em><em>o</em><em>a</em><em>d</em></sub></span> @ <span class="math"><em>f</em> = </span> 0 Hz = 64 mW</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>P</em><sub><em>l</em><em>o</em><em>a</em><em>d</em></sub></span> @ <span class="math"><em>f</em><sub><em>c</em><em>u</em><em>t</em><em>o</em><em>f</em><em>f</em></sub></span> = 32 mW</p>
<p>These load dissipation figures prove this circuit is a <em>low-pass</em> filter. They also demonstrate that the load dissipation at <span class="math"><em>f</em><sub><em>c</em><em>u</em><em>t</em><em>o</em><em>f</em><em>f</em></sub></span> is exactly half the amount of power the filter is capable of passing to the load under ideal (maximum) conditions.</p>
<p>If your students have never encountered decibel (dB) ratings before, you should explain to them that -3 dB is an expression meaning &quot;one-half power,&quot; and that this is why the cutoff frequency of a filter is often referred to as the <em>half-power point</em>.</p>
<p>The important lesson to be learned here about cutoff frequency is that its definition means something in terms of load power. It is not as though someone decided to arbitrarily define <span class="math"><em>f</em><sub><em>c</em><em>u</em><em>t</em><em>o</em><em>f</em><em>f</em></sub></span> as the point at which the load receives 70.7% of the source voltage!</p>
