<p>Sketch the harmonic &quot;signature&quot; of a perfect, symmetrical square wave (50% duty cycle) with a fundamental frequency of 1 kHz. Be sure to show at least four of the harmonic &quot;peaks&quot; on the spectrum analyzer display:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02628x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02628x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><strong>This question is intended for exams only and not worksheets!</strong>.</p>
<p>The real test here is to see whether students realize the peaks should all fall on <em>odd</em> whole-number multiples of 1 kHz. Any even-numbered harmonic is incorrect for this question, as are any higher-order harmonics greater in amplitude than any lower-order harmonics.</p>
