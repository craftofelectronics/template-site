<p>What is the ideal amount of load impedance for this amplifier circuit, so that maximum power will be delivered to it?</p>

<p>Suppose we wished to drive an 8 ohm audio speaker with this amplifier circuit. How could we better match the amplifier’s impedance to the speaker’s?</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>l</em><em>o</em><em>a</em><em>d</em></sub> = 3. 3</span> k<span class="math">Ω </span></p>
<p>To match this amplifier to an 8 <span class="math">Ω </span> speaker, we could use a matching transformer, or (better yet) a common-collector final transistor stage.</p>
<p>Ask your students to explain whether they would connect a matching transformer as a step-up or a step-down to match source and load impedances in this example. How do we know which way we need to use the transformer?</p>
<p>Challenge your students by asking them how they might calculate the necessary transformer winding ratio for this impedance matching application. I wouldn’t be surprised if many of your students do not remember the impedance ratio relationship to turns ratio back from their education in AC circuit theory. However, they <em>should</em> remember how turns ratio relates to voltage and current ratios, and from this they should be able to figure out the impedance transformation ratio of a transformer!</p>
<p>An important skill to have is the ability to reconstruct forgotten information by setting up &quot;thought experiments&quot; and deriving results from known (remembered) principles. I can’t tell you how many times in my professional and academic life that this skill has been helpful to me.</p>
