<p>Use Boolean algebra to simplify the following expression, then draw a logic gate circuit for the simplified expression:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$(A + B)(\overline{A} + \overline{B})$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02819x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Challenge question: identify the specific logic gate type that will perform this Boolean function using just a single gate.</p>
<p>Have your students explain the entire process they used in answering this question: simplifying the expression using Boolean algebra techniques, and developing a gate circuit from the simplified Boolean expression. By having your students share their thought processes with the whole class, you will increase the level of learning on the parts of presenter and viewer alike. Students presenting their solutions will gain a better understanding of how it works because the act of presenting helps consolidate what they already know. Students viewing the presentation will get to see another person’s technique (rather than just the instructor’s), which will allow them to see examples of how to do these processes cast in slightly different terms.</p>
