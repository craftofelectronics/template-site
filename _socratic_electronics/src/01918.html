<p>Suppose a metal-detecting sensor were connected to a strobe light, so that the light flashed every time a fan blade passed by the sensor. How would this setup differ in operation from one where the strobe light is free-running?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01918x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>In this system, the fan would <em>always</em> appear to &quot;stand still&quot; in a position where a fan blade is near the sensor.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: how would the strobe light respond if the fan speed were changed? Explain your answer in detail.</p>
<p>This question previews the concept of oscilloscope triggering: waiting until an event occurs before plotting the shape of a moving waveform. Often I find new students relate better to such mechanical analogies than directly to electronic abstractions when first learning oscilloscope operation.</p>
<p>An important detail to note in this scenario is that the strobe will flash <em>four times</em> per fan rotation!</p>
