<p>In the following graphic, you will see the directions of currents labeled with arrows for each semiconductor component. Some of these arrows are pointing in the direction of conventional flow, while others are pointing in the direction of electron flow. Determine which convention is being used to label currents for each component (note: I have only used one convention for each component â€“ I have not mixed conventional and electron flow while labeling multiple currents on the same component!).</p>

<p>The only clues as to notation are the arrows. Students may not be at the point where they can recognize the proper directions of current for the non-arrowed component terminals, but at least they should be able to compare the current arrows against the component symbol arrows and see whether there is agreement (conventional flow) or disagreement (electron flow).</p>
