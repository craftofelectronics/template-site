<p>When an electric current is passed through a coil of wire, what phenomenon occurs?</p>
<p>Electromagnetism.</p>
<p>Be sure that students understand the answer to this question beyond saying the word, &quot;electromagnetism.&quot; What, exactly, does this word mean? Reciting an equation is not a sufficient explanation, either. Ask them what some of the factors are that influence the strength of the electromagnetic effect.</p>
