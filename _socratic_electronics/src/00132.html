<p>Suppose this 10-mile-long RG-58/U cable were &quot;terminated&quot; by a resistor with a resistance equal to the cable’s own characteristic impedance:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00132x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>What sort of waveform or pulse would the oscilloscope register after switch closure?</p>
<p>The oscilloscope would register a continuous current of 480 mA any time the switch is closed.</p>
<p>Ask your students to compare the behavior of this circuit with that of an unterminated RG-58/U cable. How does this circuit’s behavior differ? Why is that?</p>
<p>To phrase the question in a different way, what does the inclusion of a terminating resistor do to the apparent <em>length</em> of the cable? In other words, what length of RG-58/U cable would behave exactly the same as this circuit?</p>
