<p>Some types of MOSFETs have a source-drain channel already formed with no applied gate voltage:</p>

<p>Explain what happens to source-drain conductivity with each of the following applied gate-to-substrate voltages. Modify the illustrations if necessary:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02071x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02071x03.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Ask your students to contrast the behavior of this type of MOSFET against the behavior of the type that requires a gate voltage to create an inversion layer.</p>
