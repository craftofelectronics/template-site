<p>When light strikes a <em>phototube</em>, an electric current is registered by the ammeter in this circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00222x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>What phenomenon is exhibited by the phototube in its function? What possible applications of this effect can you think of?</p>
<p>This phenomenon is called the <em>photoelectric effect</em>. Incidentally, the mathematical expression of this effect earned Albert Einstein a Nobel Prize for Physics in the year 1921.</p>
<p>There are several features of the schematic diagram worthy of note:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> High-voltage battery</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Ammeter symbol (circle with letter &quot;A&quot; inside)</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Twin arrows designating light</p>
<p>Applications of the photoelectric effect are many and varied. Special versions of the basic phototube (called <em>photomultiplier</em> tubes) are able to detect extremely small impulses of light, enabling scientists to detect small light flashes from cosmic-ray events, among other optical phenomena.</p>
