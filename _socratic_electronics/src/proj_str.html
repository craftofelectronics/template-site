<hr />
<p>Your project is to design and build a stroboscope using LEDs as the source of light. A sample schematic diagram is provided here:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{proj_str.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Of course, you are not restricted to using this exact design. The choices of timing capacitor value, power transistor selection, supply voltage, and LED type are yours. You may elect to go with a completely different circuit design as well.</p>
