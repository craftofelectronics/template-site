<p>A student is trying to get a 74HC192 up/down counter to function. However, it is simply not cooperating:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03903x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Determine what the student is doing wrong with this 74HC192, and then correct the schematic diagram.</p>
<p>Did you think I was just going to give the answer away here? Consult a datasheet for the 74HC192 to see for yourself!</p>
<p>The point of this question is to have students research a datasheet to figure out the necessary conditions for making a digital IC perform as it should. This is <em>extremely</em> important for students to get into the habit of doing, as it will save them much trouble as technicians!</p>
