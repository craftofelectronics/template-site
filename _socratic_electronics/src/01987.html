<p>Use circuit simulation software to verify your predicted and measured parameter values.</p>
<p>I have had good success using 12 volts DC for the supply voltage, an MCR8SN silicon-controlled rectifier, and a small brushless DC fan motor (80 mA running current) as the load. The MCR8SN is a &quot;sensitive gate&quot; SCR, which makes it easy to demonstrate static triggering (just <em>touch</em> the gate terminal with your finger to start the motor!). Some SCR’s may be difficult to keep latched with low-current loads, so be sure to prototype your SCR/load combination before assigning part numbers to your students!</p>
<p>An extension of this exercise is to incorporate troubleshooting questions. Whether using this exercise as a performance assessment or simply as a concept-building lab, you might want to follow up your students’ results by asking them to predict the consequences of certain circuit faults.</p>
