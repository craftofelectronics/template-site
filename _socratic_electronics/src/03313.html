<p>Match each written function (<span class="math"><em>y</em> = ⋯</span>) with the sketched graph it fits best:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$y = 5x - 2 \hbox{\hskip 70pt} y = 1 - 3x$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$y = x^3 \hbox{\hskip 70pt} y = 3^x$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03313x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03313x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The primary purpose of this question is to have students figure out <em>how</em> to match each expression to a graph. Of course, one could take the time to plot each function one by one, but there exist much simpler ways to determine the &quot;character&quot; of a function without plotting the whole thing.</p>
