<p>Note: be careful to choose a resistor with an adequate power rating (Watts)!</p>
<p>Use a variable-voltage, regulated power supply to supply any amount of DC voltage below 30 volts. For added challenge, set the power supply voltage high enough (at least 15 volts) that a 1/4 watt resistor will be inadequately rated for the power dissipation.</p>
<p>An extension of this exercise is to incorporate troubleshooting questions. Whether using this exercise as a performance assessment or simply as a concept-building lab, you might want to follow up your studentsâ€™ results by asking them to predict the consequences of certain circuit faults.</p>
