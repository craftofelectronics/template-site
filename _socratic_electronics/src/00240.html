<p>Suppose this circuit has a problem: the light bulb does not light up when the switch is turned &quot;ON&quot;. You suspect that a &quot;bad&quot; connection may exist in the circuit which is preventing current. How would you test the integrity of each connection using a voltmeter only?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00240x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>If voltage is measured across any connection of two wires, that connection is definitely faulty.</p>
<p>It may be more difficult that it first appears to test for voltage across any single connection, if the wires are covered with insulation! Ask your students this question: if you test for voltage between two screws on a terminal strip, how many electrical connections are you actually measuring voltage across?</p>
