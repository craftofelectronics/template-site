<p>A popular method of &quot;reclaiming&quot; some of the lost voltage gain resulting from the addition of an emitter resistor (<span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>E</em></sub></span>) to a common-emitter amplifier circuit is to connect a &quot;bypass&quot; capacitor in parallel with that resistor:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00965x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Explain why this technique works to increase the circuit’s AC voltage gain, without leading to the problems associated with directly grounding the emitter.</p>
<p>To an AC signal, a large capacitor &quot;looks&quot; like a lower impedance than the emitter resistor. Usually, this capacitor is sized such that <span class="math"><em>X</em><sub><em>C</em></sub></span> is very small.</p>
<p>The addition of a bypass capacitor maintains DC stability, because DC cannot go through the capacitor but must go through the emitter resistor (<span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>E</em></sub></span>) just as if the bypass capacitor were not there at all.</p>
<p>This question provides a good opportunity to review capacitive reactance (<span class="math"><em>X</em><sub><em>C</em></sub></span>). The polarized capacitor symbol hints at the capacitor’s relatively large value, and your students should realize that a large capacitor’s reactance will be relatively low to most AC signals. An idea to help communicate the &quot;bypass&quot; concept is to have one of your students re-draw the circuit as &quot;seen&quot; from the perspective of an AC signal, not a DC signal. With the capacitor effectively acting as a short-circuit to AC signals, what does the amplifier circuit look like to those signals?</p>
