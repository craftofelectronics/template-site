<p>A common class of operation used in radio-frequency (RF) amplifier circuits is <em>class-C</em>. Explain what this means, contrasting it against the class-A and class-B operations common in audio-frequency amplifier circuits.</p>
<p>Class-C amplification is where the active device (transistor, usually) is conducting substantially less than 50% of the waveform period.</p>
<p>A natural question that arises when students first hear of class-C operation is, &quot;How does a class-C amplifier circuit reproduce the entire waveform, if the transistor is completely off most of the time?&quot; The answer to this lies in <em>resonance</em>, usually supplied in the form of a tank circuit, to maintain oscillations while the transistor is cut off.</p>
