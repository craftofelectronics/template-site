<p>Define what <em>reduced-voltage starting</em> means for an electric motor, and why it is often applied to large motors.</p>
<p>Reduced-voltage starting means that less-than-full line voltage is initially applied to a motor when starting, then full voltage is applied later when the motor has reached a certain speed. This is done to mitigate inrush currents, which may be incredibly high for large electric motors.</p>
