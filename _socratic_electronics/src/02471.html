<p>Calculate the voltage gain for each stage of this amplifier circuit (both as a ratio and in units of decibels), then calculate the overall voltage gain:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02471x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math"></span> Stage 1:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math"><em>A</em><sub><em>V</em></sub></span> = 1.766 = 4.940 dB</p>
<p><span class="math"></span> Stage 2:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math"><em>A</em><sub><em>V</em></sub></span> = 0.455 = -6.848 dB</p>
<p><span class="math"></span> Overall:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> <span class="math"><em>A</em><sub><em>V</em></sub></span> = 0.803 = -1.909 dB</p>
<p>Not only does this question review calculation of voltage gain for inverting amplifier circuits, but it also reviews decibel calculations (for both single and multi-stage amplifiers). Discuss how the decibel figures for each stage add to equal the total decibel gain, whereas the ratios multiply.</p>
