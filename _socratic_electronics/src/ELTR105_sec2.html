<p>This is an unnecessary difficulty brought on by the disagreement in convention describing electric current. Some textbooks use &quot;conventional flow&quot; notation where current is shown moving from the positive terminal of a source to the negative terminal of a source. With conventional flow notation, the relationship between current and magnetic field direction is described by the right-hand rule. Other textbooks use &quot;electron flow&quot; notation, where the actual motion of electrons in a conductor is the assumed direction for current. In this convention, current moves from the negative terminal of a source to the positive terminal, with the left-hand rule describing how a magnetic field relates to the current.</p>
<p>Which one is correct? With metallic conductor circuits (which is nearly every practical circuit), electron flow notation is actually the most accurate description of charge carrier motion. However, there are reasons why conventional flow notation (and the right-hand rule) is considered more &quot;mathematically&quot; correct, which is why engineers tend to use it. This is especially the case when studying electromagnetism in depth, where the right-hand rule is revealed to be a specific application of the general mathematical rule for <em>vector cross-products</em>, and where a &quot;left-hand rule&quot; would go against all mathematical convention with regard to vectors.</p>
<p>In short, either rule will yield the correct results, so long as you are consistent in your conventions! In other words, if you consistently stick with conventional flow and the right-hand rule, you will not go wrong. Or, if you consistently stick with electron flow and the left-hand rule, you will not go wrong. You may get yourself into trouble, though, if you try to switch back and forth between the two different notations for current. My personal recommendation is to go with conventional flow notation and the right-hand rule, because most technical literature is written by and for engineers who predominantly use this. Later on in your study of electronics you will see that all semiconductor device symbols were invented with conventional flow notation in mind, their arrows always pointing in that direction.</p>
<p>Another factor complicating this subject is the presence of similar rules invented to help simplify motor and generator operation, which in fact do not follow the conventions used in physics to relate electric current and magnetism at all. Popularized in U.S. Navy publications, and called the &quot;left-hand rule for generators&quot; and the &quot;right hand rule for motors,&quot; these rules switch the ordering of magnetic flux and current direction for the index and middle fingers, and use the thumb to represent direction of motion rather than direction of force as the real vector cross-product relationship goes. The choice to have the thumb point in the direction of motion rather than the direction of force is why they have to use two different rules, one for generators and one for motors. If you maintain the conventions used in physics where the index finger represents current, the middle finger represents magnetic flux, and the thumb points in the direction of <em>force</em> (not motion!), one rule will describe all scenarios, generators and motors alike. The existence of two different rules (one for generators and one for motors) is a classic example of how over-simplification actually leads to confusion.</p>
<p>When studying electromagnetic induction and Lenz’s Law, one must think in terms of how fast a variable is changing. The amount of voltage induced in a conductor is proportional to how <em>quickly</em> the magnetic field changes, not how strong the field is. This is the first hurdle in calculus: to comprehend what a rate of change is, and it is not obvious.</p>
<p>The best examples I know of to describe rates of change are <em>velocity</em> and <em>acceleration</em>. Velocity is nothing more than a rate of change of position: how quickly one’s position is changing over time. Therefore, if the variable <span class="math"><em>x</em></span> describes position, then the derivative <span class="math">${dx \over dt}$</span> (rate of change of <span class="math"><em>x</em></span> over time <span class="math"><em>t</em></span>) must describe velocity. Likewise, acceleration is nothing more than the rate of change of velocity: how quickly velocity changes over time. If the variable <span class="math"><em>v</em></span> describes velocity, then the derivative <span class="math">${dv \over dt}$</span> must describe velocity. Or, since we know that velocity is itself the derivative of position, we could describe acceleration as the <em>second derivative</em> of position: <span class="math">${d^2 x \over dt^2}$</span></p>
<p>These two theorems are used to simplify complex circuit networks so that you may mathematically analyze them easier. Two major concepts are difficult here. First is the concept of <em>equivalent networks</em>. This is where we take a complex bunch of interconnected components and model them as a much simpler circuit that behaves in the same manner. Understanding that it is possible for a simple circuit to behave identically to a larger, more complex circuit is not intuitive. Naturally, we expect more complex things to have more complex behaviors. However, both Thévenin’s and Norton’s theorems exploit the fact that certain types of circuits may indeed be greatly simplified and still maintain their original behaviors.</p>
<p>The second major hurdle for students is seeing where these Theorems are actually useful. Here is where many textbooks fail in their presentation of these theorems: by showing the steps of Thévenin’s and Norton’s theorems only as a prelude to future applications. Indeed, while these theorems are extremely useful in analyzing the transistor circuits you will encounter later on in your studies, it is a mistake to assume there are no immediate, useful applications which you may understand right away. Hopefully the questions contained in this worksheet will allow you to comprehend some of these immediate applications.</p>
<p>At first, this theorem appears to be very simple: maximum power will be dissipated at the load when the load resistance is equal to the source circuit’s equivalent Thévenin or Norton resistance. However, many students misunderstand the scope of this theorem. What it is really saying is that power will be maximized at the load when <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>l</em><em>o</em><em>a</em><em>d</em></sub> = <em>R</em><sub><em>T</em><em>h</em><em>e</em><em>v</em><em>e</em><em>n</em><em>i</em><em>n</em></sub></span>, <em>if <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>l</em><em>o</em><em>a</em><em>d</em></sub></span> is the only resistance you have the freedom to change</em>. If <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>l</em><em>o</em><em>a</em><em>d</em></sub></span> happens to be fixed, but you have the freedom to change the source circuit’s internal resistance, then maximum load power will be achieved when <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>T</em><em>h</em><em>e</em><em>v</em><em>e</em><em>n</em><em>i</em><em>n</em></sub></span> is equal to zero!</p>
<p>Another misconception is that this theorem tells you when optimum power <em>efficiency</em> is reached. In fact, when <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>l</em><em>o</em><em>a</em><em>d</em></sub> = <em>R</em><sub><em>T</em><em>h</em><em>e</em><em>v</em><em>e</em><em>n</em><em>i</em><em>n</em></sub></span>, the system efficiency is only 50%. Exactly half of the total source power will be wasted, with only half getting to the load! Maximum <em>efficiency</em> is actually reached when the load resistance is very large compared to the source resistance, but of course the actual amount of load power (measured in watts) will be much less than if the load resistance were closer in value to <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>T</em><em>h</em><em>e</em><em>v</em><em>e</em><em>n</em><em>i</em><em>n</em></sub></span>.</p>
<p>The best way to wrap your mind around all these concepts is to draw a two-resistor, one-battery circuit and do lots of sample calculations for load resistor power, seeing for yourself what happens as the different resistor values change. Approach this scientifically: do a lot of calculations changing only one resistor at a time. Make sure you do enough calculations where you can see the trend of how that one resistor’s value affects load power before you decide to change the other resistor’s value. Changing only one variable at a time in a scientific test is very important. Otherwise, it will be difficult (or impossible) to tell <em>what</em> what is causing what to happen.</p>
