<p>Spring- and weight-driven clock mechanisms always use a <em>pendulum</em> as an integral part of their workings. What function does a pendulum serve in a clock? What would a mechanical clock mechanism do if the pendulum were removed?</p>
<p>Describe what the electrical equivalent of a mechanical pendulum is, and what purpose it might serve in an oscillator circuit.</p>
<p>The pendulum in a mechanical clock serves to regulate the frequency of the clockâ€™s ticking. The electrical equivalent of a pendulum is a <em>tank circuit</em>.</p>
<p>Ask your students to brainstorm possible applications for electrical oscillator circuits, and why frequency regulation might be an important feature.</p>
