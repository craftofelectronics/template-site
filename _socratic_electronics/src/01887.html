<p>Suppose we have an alternator with three sets of windings, <strong>A</strong>, <strong>B</strong>, and <strong>C</strong>:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01887x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Each pair of windings in each set is series-connected, so they act as just three separate windings (pay close attention to the phase-marking dots!):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01887x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>If one end of each winding pair were connected together at a common ground point, and each winding pair output 70 volts RMS, how much voltage would be measured between any two open wires?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01887x03.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>121.2 volts</p>
<p>Follow-up question: draw a phasor diagram showing how the difference in potential (voltage) between the wire ends is equal to 121.2 volts, when each winding coil’s voltage is 70 volts.</p>
<p>This question is a good exercise of students’ knowledge of phase shift, in a very practical context.</p>
