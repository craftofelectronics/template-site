<p>Your project is to design and build an AC-to-DC &quot;brute force&quot; power supply, complete with filtering to minimize ripple. The power supply will output a DC voltage somewhere between 12 and 24 volts DC, at a maximum current of 1 amp, and will contain overcurrent protection on both the AC (line) and DC (load) sides. As a line-powered device, it will also be equipped with an indicator light showing the presence of AC voltage, and the case (if metal) will be safety grounded. Here is a sample schematic diagram for you to follow when designing your system:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{proj_pwr.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Of course, you are not restricted to using this exact design. One design feature I insist on, though, is that you build your own rectifier circuit from individual diodes, rather than use a packaged rectifier assembly. I highly recommend the use of &quot;barrier strips&quot; or &quot;terminal strips&quot; to make the electrical connections between components. These connection devices provide solid, permanent electrical connections while still allowing components to be easily installed and removed.</p>
<p>I also insist on the AC power cord being securely and safely attached to the case. One of the best ways of doing this is to use a &quot;cord grip bushing&quot; or &quot;CGB&quot; to firmly secure the cord as it passes through a hole in the side of the case. Most hardware stores carry this common electrical fitting, in enough different sizes to accommodate most any power cord diameter.</p>
<p>All final versions of the power supply must be safety-checked before plugging them into line (AC) power. The safety check will consist of the following points:</p>
<p><span class="math">1. </span> Ground prong to (metal) case resistance check – <em>use a Kelvin 4-wire test configuration to measure voltage drop between the prong and case while the ground conductor is carrying at least a 1-amp current (from a benchtop power supply configured as a current source)</em>. Total ground path resistance from prong to case shall not exceed 0.1 ohm (100 mV drop at 1 amp).</p>
<p><span class="math">2. </span> Hot-to-neutral continuity measurement to check for proper operation of power switch and AC fuse.</p>
<p><span class="math">3. </span> Hot-to-ground and neutral-to-ground continuity measurements to ensure isolation from chassis ground.</p>
<p><span class="math">4. </span> Transformer secondary-to-positive output continuity measurement to check for proper operation of DC fuse.</p>
