<p>A technician uses a multimeterâ€™s &quot;diode check&quot; function to identify the terminals on a BJT. There are only two places where a non-infinite reading is obtained, and they are as follows:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03745x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>From these measurements, determine what type of BJT this is (PNP or NPN) and identify all three terminals.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03745x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>It is a very useful skill to be able to identify a BJT using nothing more than the &quot;diode check&quot; function on a multimeter.</p>
