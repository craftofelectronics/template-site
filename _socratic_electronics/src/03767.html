<p>Predict how the operation of this sound-activated relay circuit will be affected as a result of the following faults. Consider each fault independently (i.e. one at a time, no multiple faults):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03767x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Zener diode <span class="math"><em>D</em><sub>1</sub></span> fails open:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> fails open:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span> fails open:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Microphone voice coil fails open:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Comparator <span class="math"><em>U</em><sub>1</sub></span> fails with output saturated positive:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Diode <span class="math"><em>D</em><sub>3</sub></span> fails shorted:</p>
<p>For each of these conditions, explain <em>why</em> the resulting effects will occur.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Zener diode <span class="math"><em>D</em><sub>1</sub></span> fails open: <em>Volume threshold increases (relay may not energize at all).</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> fails open: <em>Any sound at all will energize the relay.</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span> fails open: <em>Relay refuses to energize.</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Microphone voice coil fails open: <em>Relay energizes randomly, as comparator input is now sensitive to static electricity.</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Comparator <span class="math"><em>U</em><sub>1</sub></span> fails with output saturated positive: <em>Relay immediately energizes, whether or not there is sound.</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Diode <span class="math"><em>D</em><sub>3</sub></span> fails shorted: <em>Relay refuses to energize, SCR will likely be damaged due to overheating after a sound event.</em></p>
<p>The purpose of this question is to approach the domain of circuit troubleshooting from a perspective of knowing what the fault is, rather than only knowing what the symptoms are. Although this is not necessarily a realistic perspective, it helps students build the foundational knowledge necessary to diagnose a faulted circuit from empirical data. Questions such as this should be followed (eventually) by other questions asking students to identify likely faults based on measurements.</p>
