<p>A step-down transformer has a winding turns ratio of 20:1. Calculate the impedance ratio from primary to secondary. Also, determine the amount of impedance &quot;seen&quot; at the primary winding if the secondary winding is connected to a 90 ohm load.</p>
<p>Impedance ratio = <span class="math"><em>Z</em><sub><em>p</em><em>r</em><em>i</em><em>m</em><em>a</em><em>r</em><em>y</em></sub></span> =</p>
<p>Impedance ratio = 400:1 <span class="math"><em>Z</em><sub><em>p</em><em>r</em><em>i</em><em>m</em><em>a</em><em>r</em><em>y</em></sub></span> = 36 k<span class="math">Ω </span></p>
<p>Most transformer problems are nothing more than ratios, but some students find ratios difficult to handle. Questions such as this are great for having students come up to the board in the front of the classroom and demonstrating how they obtained the results. In this particular case there is more to the solution than just a simple ratio, which is even more reason to have students show their different solution techniques!</p>
