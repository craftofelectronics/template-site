<p>Suppose we have an application where a DC generator provides power to charge a secondary-cell battery:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00947x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The only problem with this setup is, the generator tries to act as a motor when the engine turning it is shut off, drawing power from the battery and discharging it. How could we use a rectifying diode to prevent this from happening?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00947x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>This question provides a good opportunity to review the direction of current through a battery when charging, versus when discharging. It also shows a way we can prevent the generator from &quot;motoring&quot; without having to use a reverse-current relay.</p>
