<p>A common conceptual model of electrons within atoms is the &quot;planetary&quot; model, with electrons depicted as orbiting satellites whirling around the &quot;planet&quot; of the nucleus. The physicist Ernest Rutherford is known as the inventor of this atomic model.</p>
<p>A major improvement over this conceptual model of the atom came from Niels Bohr, who introduced the idea that electrons inhabited &quot;stationary states&quot; around the nucleus of an atom, and could only assume a new state by way of a <em>quantum leap</em>: a sudden &quot;jump&quot; from one energy level to another.</p>
<p>What led Bohr to his radical proposal of &quot;quantum leaps&quot; as an alternative to Rutherford’s model? What experimental evidence led scientists to abandon the old planetary model of the atom, and how does this evidence relate to modern electronics?</p>
<p>The fact that atomic electrons inhabit &quot;quantized&quot; energy states is evidenced by the characteristic wavelengths of light emitted by certain atoms when they are &quot;excited&quot; by external energy sources. Rutherford’s planetary model could not account for this behavior, thus the necessity for a new model of the atom.</p>
<p>Semiconductor electronics is made possible by the &quot;quantum revolution&quot; in physics. Electrical current travel through semiconductors is impossible to adequately explain apart from quantum theory.</p>
<p>Challenge question: think of an experiment that could be performed in the classroom to demonstrate the characteristic wavelengths emitted by &quot;excited&quot; atoms.</p>
<p>It is no understatement to say that the advent of quantum theory changed the world, for it made possible modern solid-state electronics. While the subject of quantum theory can be arcane, certain aspects of it are nevertheless essential to understanding electrical conduction in semiconductors.</p>
<p>I cringe every time I read an introductory electronics textbook discuss electrons orbiting atomic nuclei like tiny satellites &quot;held in orbit by electrostatic attraction and centrifugal force&quot;. Then, a few pages later, these books start talking about valence bands, conduction bands, forbidden zones, and a host of other phenomenon that make absolutely no sense within the planetary model of the atom, but only make sense in a quantum view (where electrons are only &quot;allowed&quot; to inhabit certain, discrete energy states around the nucleus).</p>
<p>In case none of your students are able to answer the challenge question, you may give them this hint: <em>gas-discharge lamps</em> (neon, hydrogen, mercury vapor, sodium, etc.)!</p>
