<p>This phase-shifting bridge circuit is supposed to provide an output voltage with a variable phase shift from -45<span class="math">$^{o}$</span> (lagging) to +45<span class="math">$^{o}$</span> (leading), depending on the position of the potentiometer wiper:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03670x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Suppose, though, that there is a solder &quot;bridge&quot; between the terminals of resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> on the circuit board. What effect will this fault have on the output of the circuit? Be as complete as you can in your answer.</p>
<p>With such a &quot;shorted&quot; failure on <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span>, there will be full source voltage at the output with the potentiometer wiper at the full-left position (no attenuation, no phase shift). The output voltage at the full-right wiper position will be mostly unaffected.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: identify another possible component failure that would exhibit the same symptoms.</p>
<p>It is essential, of course, that students understand the operational principle of this circuit before they may speculate at the effects of various component faults. You may find it necessary to discuss this circuit in detail with your students before they are ready to troubleshoot it.</p>
<p>In case anyone asks, the symbolism <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>p</em><em>o</em><em>t</em></sub> &gt;  &gt; <em>R</em></span> means &quot;potentiometer resistance is <em>much</em> greater than the fixed resistance value.&quot;</p>
