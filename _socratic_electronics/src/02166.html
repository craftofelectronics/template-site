<p>Describe what happens to the collector current of the transistor as the variable resistor’s value is changed:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02166x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Hint: it is helpful to remember that the voltage drop across a PN junction is not exactly constant as the current through it varies. There is a nonlinear relationship between diode voltage drop (<span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>D</em></sub></span>) and diode current (<span class="math"><em>I</em><sub><em>D</em></sub></span>) as described by the <em>diode equation</em>:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$I_D = I_S (e^{\left({qV_D \over NkT}\right)} - 1)$</span><br /></p>
<p>The transistor’s collector current rises and falls with the diode’s current, as dictated by the variable resistor. Ideally, the transistor collector current <em>precisely matches</em> the diode’s current.</p>
<p>This circuit is really the beginning of a <em>current mirror</em>. I have found this to be an excellent starting point for student learning on linear transistor operation, as well as a good practical introduction of current regulation circuits. Once students recognize that bipolar transistors are essentially voltage-controlled current regulators (albeit very nonlinear!), they are ready to comprehend their application as signal amplifiers.</p>
