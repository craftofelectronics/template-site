<p>This circuit uses a &quot;555&quot; integrated circuit to produce a low-frequency square-wave voltage signal (seen between the &quot;Out&quot; terminal of the chip and ground), which is used to turn a pair of transistors on and off to flash a large lamp. Predict how this circuit will be affected as a result of the following faults. Consider each fault independently (i.e. one at a time, no multiple faults):</p>

<p>For each of these conditions, explain <em>why</em> the resulting effects will occur.</p>

<p>The purpose of this question is to approach the domain of circuit troubleshooting from a perspective of knowing what the fault is, rather than only knowing what the symptoms are. Although this is not necessarily a realistic perspective, it helps students build the foundational knowledge necessary to diagnose a faulted circuit from empirical data. Questions such as this should be followed (eventually) by other questions asking students to identify likely faults based on measurements.</p>
