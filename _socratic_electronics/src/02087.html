<p>A series AC circuit exhibits a total impedance of 2.5 k<span class="math">Ω </span>, with a phase shift of 30 degrees between voltage and current. Drawn in an impedance triangle, it looks like this:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02087x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Use the appropriate trigonometric functions to calculate the equivalent values of <span class="math"><em>R</em></span> and <span class="math"><em>X</em></span> in this series circuit.</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>R</em></span> = 2.165 k<span class="math">Ω </span></p>
<p><span class="math"><em>X</em></span> = 1.25 k<span class="math">Ω </span></p>
<p>There are a few different ways one could solve for <span class="math"><em>R</em></span> and <span class="math"><em>X</em></span> in this trigonometry problem. This would be a good opportunity to have your students present problem-solving strategies on the board in front of class so everyone gets an opportunity to see multiple techniques.</p>
