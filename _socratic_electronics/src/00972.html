<p>A simple yet impractical way to eliminate crossover distortion in a Class B amplifier is to add two small voltage sources to the circuit like this:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00972x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Explain why this solution works to eliminate crossover distortion.</p>
<p>Also, explain what practical purpose this push-pull amplifier circuit might serve, since its voltage gain is only 1 (0 dB).</p>
<p>Each voltage source biases its respective transistor to be at the brink of turning on when the instantaneous voltage of the input (<span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>i</em><em>n</em></sub></span>) is 0 volts.</p>
<p>Such amplifier circuits are typically used as <em>voltage buffers</em>: effectively diminishing the output impedance of the source (boosting its current sourcing/sinking capability) so that it may supply more current to a load.</p>
<p>Challenge question: how would you estimate the output impedance of such an amplifier circuit?</p>
<p>Ask your students to relate these bias voltage sources to the DC bias voltages previously seen in Class A amplifier designs. How much voltage do they think would be necessary to properly bias each transistor?</p>
