<p>The type 74HC154 integrated circuit is a standard TTL decoder, 4-line to 16-line. Its block symbol looks like this:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01416x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>What do the &quot;wedge&quot; symbols next to the output lines represent? Also, what purpose do the <span class="math">$\overline{G1}$</span> and <span class="math">$\overline{G2}$</span> inputs serve, and why is there an ampersand character (&amp;) next to them?</p>
<p>The &quot;wedge&quot; symbols represent complementation in the IEEE/ANSI digital schematic convention, similar to &quot;bubbles&quot; placed near outputs or inputs of traditional logic gate symbols. Similarly, the ampersand character represents the AND function.</p>
<p>Perhaps the best way to determine what the <span class="math">$\overline{G1}$</span> and <span class="math">$\overline{G2}$</span> inputs do is to examine the truth table given in the datasheet for this integrated circuit.</p>
<p>Much may be learned from a good datasheet. This question, and others like it, prompts students to research manufacturer datasheets as a learning experience.</p>
<p>Note the truth table (likely) given in the datasheets your students collect. How are &quot;irrelevant&quot; states denoted in the truth tables? Ask your students what this means (especially with reference to the question regarding the strobe inputs).</p>
