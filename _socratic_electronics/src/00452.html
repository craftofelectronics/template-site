<p>Calculate the voltage across a 470 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>F capacitor after discharging through a 10 k<span class="math">Ω </span> resistor for 9 seconds, if the capacitor’s original voltage (at <span class="math"><em>t</em> = 0</span>) was 24 volts.</p>
<p>Also, express this amount of time (9 seconds) in terms of how many <em>time constants</em> have elapsed.</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>E</em><sub><em>C</em></sub> = 3. 537</span> volts @ <span class="math"><em>t</em> = 9</span> seconds.</p>
<p>9 s = 1.915 time constants (<span class="math">1. 915<em>τ</em></span>)</p>
<p>Here, students must choose which equation to use for the calculation, calculate the time constant for the circuit, and put all the variables in the right place to obtain the correct answer. Discuss all these steps with your students, allowing them to explain how they approached the question.</p>
