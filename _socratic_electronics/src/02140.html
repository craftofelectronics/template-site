<p>A unijunction transistor with an intrinsic standoff ratio (<span class="math"><em>η</em></span>) of 0.8 is powered by a 15 volt DC source. Calculate the emitter voltage needed to &quot;trigger&quot; this UJT into its conductive state.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02140x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>P</em></sub> ≈ </span> 12.7 volts</p>
<p>Nothing special here, just practice calculating the trigger voltage. Note to your students that the symbol for the intrinsic standoff ratio (<span class="math"><em>η</em></span>) is the Greek letter &quot;eta,&quot; which also happens to be used to symbolize efficiency.</p>
