<p>This is a schematic of an RF amplifier using a JFET as the active element:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01178x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>What configuration of JFET amplifier is this (common drain, common gate, or common source)? Also, explain the purpose of the two iron-core inductors in this circuit. Hint: inductors <span class="math"><em>L</em><sub>1</sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>L</em><sub>2</sub></span> are often referred to as <em>RF chokes</em>.</p>
<p>This is a common-gate amplifier. The iron-core inductors block (&quot;choke&quot;) the high-frequency AC signals from getting to the DC power supply.</p>
<p>Be sure to ask your students <em>why</em> it would not be good for the RF signals to find their way to the DC power supply. There is more than one possible answer to this question!</p>
<p>This schematic was derived from an evaluation amplifier schematic shown in an J308/J309/J310 transistor datasheet.</p>
