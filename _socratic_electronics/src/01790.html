<p>Calculate the necessary resistance value and power rating for <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>r</em><em>a</em><em>n</em><em>g</em><em>e</em></sub></span> in order to make the meter movement respond as a voltmeter with a range of 0 to 100 volts:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01790x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math">$R_{range} = 99.35 \hbox{ k} \Omega$</span>, <span class="math">$1 \over 8$</span> watt will be sufficient.</p>
<p>This is really nothing more than a simple series circuit problem, although the context of it being a voltmeter seems to confuse some students. If you find a large percentage of your class not understanding where to begin in a problem such as this, it means they really don’t understand series circuits – all they learned to do when studying series resistor circuits before is to follow an easy sequence of steps to find voltages and currents in series resistor circuits. They did not learn the concepts well enough to abstract to something that looks just a little bit different.</p>
