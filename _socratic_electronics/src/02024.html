<p>Suppose you were handed a black box with two metal terminals on one side, for attaching electrical (wire) connections. Inside this box, you were told, was a current source connected in parallel with a resistance.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02024x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Your task was to experimentally determine the values of the current source and the resistor inside the box, and you did just that. From your experimental data you then sketched a circuit with the following component values:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02024x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>However, you later discovered that you had been tricked. Instead of containing a current source and a resistor, the circuit inside the box was actually a <em>voltage source</em> connected in <em>series</em> with a resistor:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02024x03.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Demonstrate that these two different circuits are indistinguishable from the perspective of the two metal terminals, and explain what general principle this equivalence represents.</p>
<p>A good way to demonstrate the electrical equivalence of these circuits is to calculate their responses to identical load resistor values. The equivalence you see here proves that Thévenin and Norton equivalent circuits are interchangeable.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: give a step-by-step procedure for converting a Thévenin equivalent circuit into a Norton equivalent circuit, and visa-versa.</p>
<p>Ask your students to clearly state both Thévenin’s and Norton’s Theorems, and also discuss why both these theorems are important electrical analysis tools.</p>
