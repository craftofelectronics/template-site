<p>Compare and contrast these three techniques for printed circuit board soldering:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Hand</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Wave</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Reflow</p>
<p><em>Hand</em> soldering is exactly what is sounds like: soldering done manually, by a human being.</p>
<p><em>Wave</em> soldering momentarily passes the PCB just over a bath of molten solder, allowing the solder to &quot;wick&quot; onto the pads and through via holes.</p>
<p><em>Reflow</em> soldering uses solder &quot;paste&quot; applied to each pad, and a hot oven to melt the solder for joining components to the board.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: which technique is most appropriate for the following applications?</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Mass production with through-hole components</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Mass production with surface-mount components</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Single-board prototyping</p>
<p>If possible, show videos of automated soldering processes to your students. It is quite educational (and awe-inspiring) for students familiar with tedious hand-soldering techniques to see how large volumes of circuit boards can be soldered using modern wave and reflow techniques.</p>
