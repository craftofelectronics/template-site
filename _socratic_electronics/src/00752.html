<p>Stereo (two-speaker) headphones typically use a plug with three contact points to connect the speakers to the audio amplifier. The three contact points are designated as &quot;tip,&quot; &quot;ring,&quot; and &quot;sleeve&quot; for reasons that are obvious upon inspection, and as such the plug is commonly referred to as a &quot;TRS&quot; plug. Both speakers in the headphone unit share a common connection (at the &quot;sleeve&quot; contact), with the &quot;tip&quot; and &quot;ring&quot; contacts providing connection to left and right speakers, respectively:</p>

<p>Draw a picture showing how connections would be made to the plugâ€™s contact points to form this circuit:</p>

<p>This question challenges students to determine what &quot;common&quot; means, in relation to the speaker connections. Also, it requires that they translate the nice, clean schematic diagram into a real-world illustration, which is a difficult task for some (but well worth the time to practice!).</p>
