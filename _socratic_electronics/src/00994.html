<p>What does the parameter <span class="math"><em>I</em><sub><em>D</em><em>S</em><em>S</em></sub></span> mean for a JFET? How can we use this figure, along with <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>G</em><em>S</em>(<em>o</em><em>f</em><em>f</em>)</sub></span>, and <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>G</em><em>S</em></sub></span>, to calculate the amount of drain current (<span class="math"><em>I</em><sub><em>D</em></sub></span>) for a JFET operating in its active region? Write the equation for the relationship between these four variables.</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>I</em><sub><em>D</em><em>S</em><em>S</em></sub></span> is the amount of (regulated) current that will go through a JFETâ€™s drain when the gate terminal is shorted to the source terminal.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$I_D = I_{DSS}\Bigl(1 - {V_{GS} \over V_{GS(off)}}\Bigr)^2$</span><br /></p>
<p>Follow-up question: how could you empirically determine the <span class="math"><em>I</em><sub><em>D</em><em>S</em><em>S</em></sub></span> rating of a JFET? What sort of circuit would you have to set up in order to test and measure this transistor parameter?</p>
<p>Be sure to ask students where they found this equation! It should be available from most basic electronics textbooks. Also, discuss the experimental circuit that would have to be constructed in order to test the shorted-gate drain current of a JFET. You might want to plan on having your students build this very circuit during class time as an exercise in using JFETs.</p>
