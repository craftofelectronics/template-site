<p>If an AC circuit has a lagging power factor, the way to correct for that power factor is to add a capacitor to the circuit to create <em>leading</em> reactive power. This leading reactive power will cancel the lagging reactive power of the load, ideally negating one another so that there is no reactive power demands placed on the source (zero net reactive power in the circuit):</p>

<p>Define a step-by-step procedure for calculating the size of compensating capacitor needed (in Farads) in order to correct any lagging power factor to a value of unity. Make your procedure general enough that it may apply to any scenario.</p>
<p>I’ll let you determine your own procedure, based on the steps you had to take to correct power factor in other questions!</p>

<p>Students generally do not like to explain procedures. They would much rather follow a procedure given by an Authority, because it requires less thinking. It is your responsibility as their instructor to enforce the requirement for thinking in the classroom. It serves your students little to provide them with step-by-step instructions on how to calculate certain things, because ultimately their success will depend on their ability to think deeply and critically, and to problem-solve all on their own.</p>
<p>Answering this question in a group discussion setting need not be intimidating. You may choose to have groups of students answer this question instead of just one or two, or you may even assign this question specifically to a group of students so that there is the impetus of shared responsibility and the safety of friendly assistance in finding an answer.</p>
