<p>Complete the timing diagram for this three-bit counter circuit, and also determine whether it counts <em>up</em> or <em>down</em>. Assume that all <span class="math"><em>Q</em></span> outputs begin in the low state:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03076x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Counting <em>up</em> or <em>down</em>?</p>
<p>This counter circuit counts in the <strong>up</strong> direction:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03076x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Note to instructor: <em>I recommend assigning two points to each correct <span class="math"><em>Q</em></span> output waveform, and another two points to the direction of count.</em></p>
