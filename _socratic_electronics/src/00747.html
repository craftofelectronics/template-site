<p>Class-A operation may be obtained from this simple transistor circuit if the input voltage (<span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>i</em><em>n</em></sub></span>) is &quot;biased&quot; with a series-connected DC voltage source:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00747x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>First, define what &quot;Class A&quot; amplifier operation is. Then, explain <em>why</em> biasing is required for this transistor to achieve it.</p>
<p>&quot;Class A&quot; amplifier operation is when the transistor remains in its &quot;active&quot; mode (conducting current) throughout the entire waveform. Biasing may be thought of as a kind of &quot;trick&quot; used to get the transistor (a DC device) to &quot;think&quot; it is amplifying DC when the input signal is really AC.</p>
<p>A &quot;trick&quot; it may be, but a very useful and very common &quot;trick&quot; it is! Discuss this concept with your students at length, being sure they have ample time and opportunity to ask questions of their own.</p>
<p>One question that may arise is, &quot;how much DC bias voltage is necessary?&quot; If no one asks this question, ask it yourself! Discuss with your students what would constitute the minimum amount of bias voltage necessary to ensure the transistor never goes into &quot;cutoff&quot; anywhere in the waveformâ€™s cycle, and also the maximum bias voltage to prevent the transistor from &quot;saturating&quot;.</p>
