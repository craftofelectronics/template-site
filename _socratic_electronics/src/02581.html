<p>Read the following quotation, and then research the term <strong>microcontroller</strong> to see what relevance it has to the quote:</p>
<p>– Danny Hillis</p>
<p>I’ll let you do your homework on this question!</p>
<p>Not only is the quotation funny, but it is startling as well, especially to those of us who were born without any computers in our homes at all, much less multiple personal computers.</p>
<p>A point I wish to make in having students research the term &quot;microcontroller&quot; is to see that most of the computers in existence are not of the variety one ordinarily thinks of by the label &quot;computer.&quot; Those doorknob computers – as well as engine control computers in automobiles, kitchen appliances, cellular telephones, biomedical implants, talking birthday cards, and other small devices – are much smaller and much more specialized than the &quot;general purpose&quot; computers people use at their desks to write documents or surf the internet. They are the silent, unseen side of the modern &quot;computer revolution,&quot; and in many ways are more appropriate for beginning students of digital electronics to explore than their larger, general-purpose counterparts.</p>
