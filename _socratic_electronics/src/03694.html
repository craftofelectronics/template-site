<p>Explain how the following power-line harmonic analyzer circuit works:</p>

<p><span class="math"></span><span class="math"></span></p>
<p>Each series LC section is a resonant band-pass filter, tuned to successive harmonics of a 60 Hz sine wave. The selector switch enables a single voltmeter to measure the RMS amplitude of each harmonic.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: calculate the <em>exact</em> inductance values necessary for precise tuning of the five LC filters, for the first five harmonics of a 60 Hz waveform.</p>
<p>Challenge question: the voltmeter in this circuit would not have to be a true-RMS meter. It could simply be an average-responding (RMS-calibrated) voltmeter and it would work the same. Explain why.</p>
<p>This question provides students with some review of passive filter circuit theory, as well as insight into a practical circuit they could conceivably build as a project.</p>
<p>A very important design feature of this circuit is the narrow bandwidth of each harmonic &quot;channel.&quot; The filter pass-bands must <em>not</em> come close to overlapping, or else the meter response will not be exclusively indicative of the harmonic it is switched to. High Q values for each filter section ensure that the meter will <em>only</em> register the particular harmonic that is selected for measurement.</p>
