<p>Calculate the theoretical length for a &quot;half-wave&quot; antenna, assuming a transmitter &quot;carrier&quot; frequency of 105.3 MHz:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02281x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Also, calculate the practical antenna length considering the &quot;end effect,&quot; which makes the antennaâ€™s <em>electrical length</em> slightly different from its <em>physical length</em> (assume a <span class="math"><em>K</em></span> factor of 0.95).</p>
<p><span class="math">$\left({\lambda \over 2}\right)_{theoretical}$</span> = 1.425 meters</p>
<p><span class="math">$\left({\lambda \over 2}\right)_{practical}$</span> = 1.353 meters</p>
<p>Here, students must understand the mathematical relationship between antenna length and operating frequency, both theoretical and practical.</p>
