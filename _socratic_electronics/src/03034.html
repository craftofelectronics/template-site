<p>The purpose of this circuit is to perform a timing function, turning on the LED for a limited amount of time when the switch is thrown to the right:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03034x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Suppose the switch begins in the left position, then is thrown to the right for exactly 5 seconds. During those 5 seconds of time, how much total time does the LED spend energized (on), and how much total time does the LED spend de-energized (off)?</p>
<p>LED total on time = LED total off time =</p>
<p>LED total on time = 1.516 s LED total off time = 3.484 s</p>
