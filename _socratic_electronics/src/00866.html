<p>An important operational parameter of an amplifier is its <em>bandwidth</em>. Describe what &quot;bandwidth&quot; means in the general sense, and give an example of an amplifier application where bandwidth is important.</p>
<p>&quot;Bandwidth&quot; refers to the range of signal frequencies an amplifier can handle within specified bounds of gain, distortion, efficiency, etc.</p>
<p>As your students research the word &quot;bandwidth,&quot; they will find this term has application in many areas other than amplifiers. Discuss this term, both in the context of amplifiers and in the context of other applications.</p>
