<p><em>Cutoff</em> voltage is not the same thing as <em>pinch-off</em> voltage, although the names seem quite similar. Give a concise definition for each of these field-effect transistor parameters, referencing them to a graph of characteristic curves if possible.</p>
<p><em>Cutoff</em> voltage is that gate-to-source voltage (<span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>G</em><em>S</em></sub></span>) resulting in zero drain current. <em>Pinch-off</em> voltage is that drain-to-source voltage (<span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>D</em><em>S</em></sub></span>) value where further increases do not yield significantly greater drain current values.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: which of these two parameters is more appropriate to consider when using an FET as a switch, and which is more appropriate when using an FET as a linear amplifier?</p>
<p>This contrast and comparison is probably best shown on a graph of characteristic curves, but I leave this to the student to research!</p>
