<p><em>(Strongly Recommended!)</em> This is basically one-half of an AC/DC power supply circuit, consisting of a line power plug, on/off switch, fuse, indicator lamp, and a step-down transformer. The reason this project idea is strongly recommended is that it may serve as the basis for the recommended power supply project in the next course (ELTR120 – Semiconductors 1). If you build the AC section now, you will not have to re-build an enclosure or any of the line-power circuitry later! Note that the first lab (step-down transformer circuit) may serve as a prototype for this project with just a few additional components.</p>
<p>A test device used to listen (audibly) to AC signals in the audio-frequency range. Highly recommended, as it provides a great learning experience as well as a very useful piece of test equipment for your personal projects, especially when working on audio amplifiers. May be expensive due to the need for a pair of closed-cup headphones.</p>
<p>Recommended for advanced students only, as it involves semiconductor components which have not been covered yet. May be designed around an astable multivibrator circuit, or a 555 timer chip. Ask instructor for design details.</p>
<p>Recommended for advanced students only, as it involves the use of at least one integrated circuit &quot;chip.&quot; There are multiple signal generator chips on the market, all of which are fairly easy to configure and use with no knowledge of their internal operation.</p>

<p>When studying electromagnetic induction and Lenz’s Law, one must think in terms of how fast a variable is changing. The amount of voltage induced in a conductor is proportional to how <em>quickly</em> the magnetic field changes, not how strong the field is. This is the first hurdle in calculus: to comprehend what a rate of change is, and it is not obvious.</p>
<p>The best examples I know of to describe rates of change are <em>velocity</em> and <em>acceleration</em>. Velocity is nothing more than a rate of change of position: how quickly one’s position is changing over time. Therefore, if the variable <span class="math"><em>x</em></span> describes position, then the derivative <span class="math">${dx \over dt}$</span> (rate of change of <span class="math"><em>x</em></span> over time <span class="math"><em>t</em></span>) must describe velocity. Likewise, acceleration is nothing more than the rate of change of velocity: how quickly velocity changes over time. If the variable <span class="math"><em>v</em></span> describes velocity, then the derivative <span class="math">${dv \over dt}$</span> must describe velocity. Or, since we know that velocity is itself the derivative of position, we could describe acceleration as the <em>second derivative</em> of position: <span class="math">${d^2 x \over dt^2}$</span></p>
<p>Many transformer problems are nothing more than exercises in mathematical ratios. Once students become comfortable manipulating these ratios to solve for voltages, currents, and/or winding turns, it is easy. Unfortunately, it is also very easy to accidently reverse the ratios (e.g. 3 to 1 instead of 1 to 3). With regard to voltage and current for both sides of a transformer, there is a very simple way to check your work. Like all passive devices, transformers can never output more power than they input. And because they are efficient, their output power is rarely less than 90% of their input power. For many practice problems, 100% efficiency is assumed, so output power must be the same as input power. To check your voltage and current calculations, figure out primary power from primary voltage and primary current, then do the same for the secondary side. The two power calculations should match!</p>
<p>For those students who choose to build the line-powered AC power supply, it is good to review the principles of electrical safety. Unlike nearly all the previous labs which harbored little or no shock hazard, this project can shock you. The most important rule you can follow is to simply unplug the circuit from the AC line before reaching toward any part of the circuit with your hand or with a conductive tool. The only things you should touch a live circuit with are test probes for measurement equipment! Another common mistake is to fail to remove conductive jewelry (bracelets, rings, etc.) prior to working with line-powered circuits.</p>
