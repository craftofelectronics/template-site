<p>In this circuit, three resistors receive the same amount of voltage (24 volts) from a single source. Calculate the amount of current &quot;drawn&quot; by each resistor, as well as the amount of power dissipated by each resistor:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00089x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math"><em>I</em><sub>1Ω </sub> = 24</span> amps</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>I</em><sub>2Ω </sub> = 12</span> amps</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>I</em><sub>3Ω </sub> = 8</span> amps</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>P</em><sub>1Ω </sub> = 576</span> watts</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>P</em><sub>2Ω </sub> = 288</span> watts</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>P</em><sub>3Ω </sub> = 192</span> watts</p>
<p>The answers to this question may seem paradoxical to students: <em>the lowest value of resistor dissipates the greatest power</em>. Math does not lie, though.</p>
<p>Another purpose of this question is to instill in students’ minds the concept of components in a simple parallel circuit all sharing the same amount of voltage.</p>
<p>Challenge your students to recognize any mathematical patterns in the respective currents and power dissipations. What can be said, mathematically, about the current drawn by the 2 <span class="math">Ω </span> resistor versus the 1 <span class="math">Ω </span> resistor, for example?</p>
<p>You might want to mention that in electrical parlance, a &quot;heavy&quot; load is one that draws a large amount of current, and thus has a large resistance. This circuit, which shows how the lowest resistance in a parallel circuit consumes the most power, gives practical support to the term &quot;heavy&quot; used to describe loads.</p>
