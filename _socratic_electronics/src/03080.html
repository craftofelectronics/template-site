<p>A particular RAM memory chip has eight address lines (<span class="math"><em>A</em><sub>0</sub></span> through <span class="math"><em>A</em><sub>7</sub></span>) and eight data lines (<span class="math"><em>D</em><sub>0</sub></span> through <span class="math"><em>D</em><sub>7</sub></span>), in addition to the power terminals and other inputs:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03080x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>How many unique locations (addresses) does this memory chip have in which to store binary numbers? How many bits of data are stored in each of those locations?</p>
<p>256 addresses, 8 bits of data each.</p>
