<p>Large power distribution centers are often equipped with capacitors to correct for lagging (inductive) power factor of many industrial loads. There is never any one value for capacitance that will precisely correct for the power factor, though, because load conditions constantly change. At first it may seem that a variable capacitor would be the answer (adjustable to compensate for <em>any</em> value of lagging power factor), but variable capacitors with the ratings necessary for power line compensation would be prohibitively large and expensive.</p>
<p>One solution to this problem of variable capacitance uses a set of electromechanical relays with fixed-value capacitors:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03625x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Explain how a circuit such as this provides a step-variable capacitance, and determine the range of capacitance it can provide.</p>
<p>Capacitors may be selected in combination to provide anywhere from 0 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>F to 15 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>F, in 1 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>F steps.</p>
<p>Although semiconductor-based static VAR compensator circuits are now the method of choice for modern power systems, this technique is still valid and is easy enough for beginning students to comprehend. A circuit such as this is a great application of the binary number system, too!</p>
