<p>Determine the frequency of this waveform, as displayed by an oscilloscope with a vertical sensitivity of 2 volts per division and a timebase of 0.5 milliseconds per division:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01668x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>400 Hz</p>
<p>This is just a straightforward exercise in determining period and translating that value into frequency.</p>
