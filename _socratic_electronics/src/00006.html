<p>The ignition system in a spark-ignition automobile engine produces voltages in the range of tens of thousands of volts: greater than the voltage levels typically used to distribute electric power through neighborhoods. Although this is capable of producing very painful electric shocks, the actual shock <em>hazard</em> it poses to a person is minimal. Why is this?</p>
<p>Automotive ignition systems pose little direct shock hazard because of two factors: the <em>resistance</em> intrinsic to the high voltage circuit limits current to a fairly low value even without the resistance of a person’s body in the circuit; and the high voltage pulse lasts only a brief moment in time.</p>
<p>This is not to say that ignition systems pose no hazard, though. One of the main hazards is the reaction a shock produces in a person: namely, the jerking of limbs which could be dangerous in the proximity of moving parts. Emphasize that hazards may often be indirect: that something in itself may not be enough to hurt you, but you body’s reaction to that something is what poses the greater threat.</p>
<p>An example of this general principle is an allergic reaction. The threat here is the body’s over-reaction to an allergen, not the allergen itself!</p>
