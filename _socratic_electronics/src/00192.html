<p>Suppose you wished to build a component with no other purpose than to provide capacitance in an electric circuit (a <em>capacitor</em>). How might you design such a device to perform this function, and how could you maximize its capacitance?</p>
<p>I’ll let you determine how a capacitor is constructed, from your own research.</p>
<p>To increase capacitance:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Increase plate area</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Decrease spacing between plates</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Increase permittivity of dielectric</p>
<p>These factors affecting capacitance are very hypothetical when dealing with fixed-value capacitors. After all, few people will ever have to <em>design</em> or <em>construct</em> a capacitor. However, these factors are very practical and important to understand when dealing with stray capacitance between conductors, where conductor layout and placement are well within the control of those building an electrical system!</p>
<p>These factors are also important to understand for comprehending the function of variable capacitors. Be sure to bring up the subject of variable capacitors in your discussion with students.</p>
