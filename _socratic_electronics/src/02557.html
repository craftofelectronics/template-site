<p>The following circuit is sometimes referred to as a <em>polarity separator</em>. Invent some test conditions you would use to &quot;prove&quot; the operation of the circuit, then analyze the circuit under those imagined conditions and see what the results are:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02557x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Explain what each output does in this &quot;polarity separator&quot; circuit for any given input voltage.</p>
<p>The <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>o</em><em>u</em><em>t</em>1</sub></span> output is the inverse (negative) of any positive input voltage, while the <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>o</em><em>u</em><em>t</em>2</sub></span> output is the inverse (positive) of any negative input voltage.</p>
<p>This circuit is a good introduction to the full-wave precision rectifier circuit, although its operation there is a bit more difficult to understand than it is here.</p>
