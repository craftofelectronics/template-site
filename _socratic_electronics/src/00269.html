<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00269x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Between TB1-1 and TB1-3</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Between TB1-4 and TB2-4</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Between TB2-3 and TB2-1</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Between TB1-1 and TB2-1</p>
<p>Hint: it might help to draw a neat schematic diagram of this circuit first, with all connection points labeled!</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Between TB1-1 and TB1-3 (<em>Voltmeter measures 9 volts</em>)</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Between TB1-4 and TB2-4 (<em>Voltmeter measures 9 volts</em>)</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Between TB2-3 and TB2-1 (<em>Voltmeter measures 0 volts</em>)</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Between TB1-1 and TB2-1 (<em>Voltmeter measures 9 volts</em>)</p>
<p>Ask your students this question: how does the break in the wire affect electrical &quot;commonality&quot; between TB1-4 and TB2-4?</p>
