<p>What, exactly, is a <em>short circuit</em>? What does it mean if a circuit becomes <em>shorted</em>? How does this differ from an <em>open</em> circuit?</p>
<p>A <em>short circuit</em> is a circuit having very little resistance, permitting large amounts of current. If a circuit becomes <em>shorted</em>, it means that a path for current formerly possessing substantial resistance has been bypassed by a path having negligible (almost zero) resistance.</p>
<p>Conversely, an <em>open circuit</em> is one where there is a break preventing any current from going through at all.</p>
<p>Discuss with your students some of the potential hazards of short circuits. It will then be apparent why a &quot;short circuit&quot; is a bad thing. Ask students if they can think of any realistic circumstance that could lead to a short-circuit developing.</p>
<p>I have noticed over several years of teaching electronics that the terms &quot;short&quot; or &quot;short-circuit&quot; are often used by new students as generic labels for <em>any</em> type of circuit fault, rather than the specific condition just described. This is a habit that must be corrected, if students are to communicate intelligently with others in the profession. To say that a component &quot;is shorted&quot; means a very definite thing: it is not a generic term for any type of circuit fault.</p>
