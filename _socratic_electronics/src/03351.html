<p>Resistors are often used to drop excessive voltage so that low-voltage devices may successfully operate from the power provided by high(er)-voltage sources. For example, this 1.7 volt light-emitting diode (LED) uses a resistor connected in series to be able to operate from the output of the 22 volt generator:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03351x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Calculate the necessary resistance of this resistor, as well as its minimum power rating (choose from 1/8 watt, 1/4 watt, 1/2 watt, 1 watt, or 2 watt).</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>R</em></span> = <span class="math"><em>P</em></span> (rating) =</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>R</em></span> = 1.1278 k<span class="math">Ω </span> <span class="math"><em>P</em></span> (rating) = 1/2 watt minimum</p>
