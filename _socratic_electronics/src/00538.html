<p>If an oscilloscope is connected to a series combination of AC and DC voltage sources, what is displayed on the oscilloscope screen depends on where the &quot;coupling&quot; control is set.</p>
<p>With the coupling control set to &quot;DC&quot;, the waveform displayed will be elevated above (or depressed below) the &quot;zero&quot; line:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00538x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Setting the coupling control to &quot;AC&quot;, however, results in the waveform automatically centering itself on the screen, about the zero line.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00538x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Based on these observations, explain what the &quot;DC&quot; and &quot;AC&quot; settings on the coupling control actually mean.</p>
<p>The &quot;DC&quot; setting allows the oscilloscope to display <em>all</em> components of the signal voltage, both AC and DC, while the &quot;AC&quot; setting blocks all DC within the signal, to only display the varying (AC) portion of the signal on the screen.</p>
<p>A common misconception among students is that the &quot;DC&quot; setting is used for measuring DC signals only, and that the &quot;AC&quot; setting is used for measuring AC signals only. I often refer to the &quot;DC&quot; setting as <em>direct coupling</em> in order to avoid the connotation of &quot;direct current,&quot; in an attempt to reinforce the idea that with &quot;DC&quot; coupling, what you see is all thatâ€™s really there. With &quot;AC&quot; coupling, only part of the signal is being coupled to the input amplifier circuitry.</p>
