<p>In a common-collector transistor amplifier circuit with voltage divider biasing, the input impedance (<span class="math"><em>Z</em><sub><em>i</em><em>n</em></sub></span>) is a function of load impedance, emitter resistance (<span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>E</em></sub></span>), and the two biasing resistances (<span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span>). Often, the biasing resistances are of sufficiently low value to swamp the input impedance of the transistor, so that <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span> constitute the heaviest load for any input signals driving the amplifier.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02768x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math"><em>Z</em><sub><em>i</em><em>n</em></sub> ≈ <em>R</em><sub>1</sub> ∣∣ <em>R</em><sub>2</sub> ∣∣ (<em>β</em> + 1)[<em>r</em>ʹ<sub><em>e</em></sub> + (<em>R</em><sub><em>E</em></sub> ∣∣ <em>R</em><sub><em>l</em><em>o</em><em>a</em><em>d</em></sub>)]</span><br /></p>
<p>This is a shame, because the only practical purpose served by <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span> is to provide a stable bias voltage so the transistor always functions in class A mode. In order to provide a stable bias, these resistors have to be relatively low in value compared to the impedance seen at the base of the transistor (resulting from the load). Otherwise, changes in dynamic emitter resistance (<span class="math"><em>r</em>ʹ<sub><em>e</em></sub></span>) could result in significant bias shifts. So, the naturally high input impedance of the common-collector transistor configuration is spoiled by the necessary presence of <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>1</sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>2</sub></span>.</p>
<p>A clever way to recover some of that naturally large input impedance is to add a bit of <em>regenerative</em> (positive) feedback to the circuit in the form of a capacitor and another resistor. This technique is given an equally clever name: <em>bootstrapping</em>.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02768x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Explain how bootstrapping works, and why that particular name is given to the technique.</p>
<p>By feeding some of the emitter signal to the base of the transistor, the transistor helps drive itself, reducing the load on the signal source (connected at <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>i</em><em>n</em></sub></span>). This is analogous to the fanciful scenario of someone making themselves lighter by pulling up on their own bootstraps.</p>
<p>Bootstrapping is an oft-used technique to boost amplifier input impedance, and it hints at the amazing potential of signal feedback in amplifier circuits. You might want to mention that bootstrapping is practical only if the feedback gain is slightly <em>less</em> than 1. If there is too much positive feedback, the amplifier will turn into an oscillator!</p>
