<p>Explain the simplest way to perform a single-point calibration on a highly sensitive, precision voltmeter. How do you ensure the voltmeter is receiving a fixed input of known quantity, especially without having expensive calibration equipment available?</p>
<p>Short the voltmeterâ€™s test leads together. This creates an input condition of zero volts.</p>
<p>Challenge your students with this question: &quot;If zero is an appropriate signal to use for a single-point calibration, then why not just leave the two test leads disconnected? Why should you <em>short</em> them together?&quot;</p>
<p>If you happen to have a sensitive voltmeter available in the classroom, the answer may be demonstrated with ease. This is especially true if you place the voltmeter in the &quot;AC millivolt&quot; range so it picks up stray power-line voltages from nearby electrical devices and utilities.</p>
