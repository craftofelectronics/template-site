<p>Calculate the output voltages of these two voltage divider circuits (from point <strong>A</strong> to ground, and from point <strong>B</strong> to ground:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00542x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Now, calculate the voltage between points <strong>A</strong> (red lead) and <strong>B</strong> (black lead).</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>A</em></sub> = </span> + 65.28 V</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>B</em></sub> = </span> + 75.0 V</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>A</em><em>B</em></sub> = </span> - 9.72 V</p>
<p>In this question, I want students to see how the voltage between the two dividers’ output terminals is the difference between their individual output voltages. I also want students to see the notation used to denote the voltages (use of subscripts, with an applied reference point of ground). Although voltage is <em>always and forever</em> a quantity between two points, it is appropriate to speak of voltage being &quot;at&quot; a single point in a circuit if there is an implied point of reference (ground).</p>
