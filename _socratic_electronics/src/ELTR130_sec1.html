<p>Uses an op-amp to amplify the output of a digital audio playback device (such as a CD-audio or MP3 player) for use as a sine wave signal generator. Sine waves at different frequencies are recorded on digital media as different tracks – the op-amp circuit providing voltage and current gain – allowing the use of any inexpensive consumer-grade audio playback device as an audio frequency signal generator.</p>
<p>Uses an op-amp to amplify the output of a speaker (used as a microphone) to power another speaker located some distance away. With a reversing switch, the roles of the two speakers may be reversed (send versus receive).</p>
<p>Uses an op-amp to amplify small voltages generated by a stationary &quot;pickup&quot; coil located near a pendulum-mounted permanent magnet. Vibrations in the earth create motion between the magnet and the coil, inducing voltage in the coil. The op-amp output then drives a meter, recording device, or an alarm.</p>
<p>There are many ways to make such a circuit, but almost all of them use a comparator to compare an adjustable DC reference voltage against a varying (oscillating) voltage produced by an oscillator circuit. The resulting comparator output will be a square wave with variable duty cycle, useful for driving power transistors for PWM power control of electric loads.</p>
<p>Uses an op-amp to &quot;buffer&quot; the reference voltage of a zener diode, driving a transistor to maintain constant DC voltage to a load. The op-amp provides much greater precision and regulation over a wide range of load resistances than a simple zener-BJT regulator circuit could on its own.</p>
<p>The &quot;sensitive audio detector&quot; circuit suggested in ELTR115 (AC 2) may be improved with the addition of an op-amp amplification stage. This can drastically raise input impedance and sensitivity.</p>
<p>Passive infra-red detectors are available for purchase (or salvaged from old motion-sensitive light controller circuits) which output a small DC voltage corresponding to IR light intensity. By amplifying this voltage and passing it through an active differentiator circuit, an output voltage representing <em>rate of change</em> of IR light will be produced. This signal may then be sent to a comparator to trigger an alarm or take some other action when a warm object <em>moves</em> by the sensor.</p>
<p>Uses a JFET or MOSFET input op-amp to drive and analog meter movement for precise measurement of DC voltage.</p>

<p>Some students find it quite difficult to grasp why the DC output voltage of a common-emitter amplifier <em>decreases</em> as the DC input voltage level increases. Step-by-step DC analysis of the circuit is the only remedy I have found to this conceptual block: getting students to carefully analyze what happens as voltages increase and decrease.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most difficult concept to grasp regarding differential pair circuits is that they are basically a hybrid of common-collector, common-base, and common-emitter amplifiers. This is why a strong knowledge of the three basic amplifier types is essential for understanding how differential pairs work, and why I begin exploring differential pairs by reviewing C-C, C-E, and C-B amplifiers.</p>
<p>The key to determining the polarity of a comparator’s output is applying Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law to the two signals at the input terminals to find the differential input voltage, then seeing whether the differential voltage’s polarity matches the polarity markings of the comparator’s input terminals. If so, the output will saturate in a positive direction. If not, the output will saturate in a negative direction.</p>
<p>Few concepts are as fundamentally important in electronics as negative feedback, and so it is essential for the electronics student to learn well. However, it is not an easy concept for many to grasp. The notion that a portion of the output signal may be &quot;fed back&quot; into the input in a degenerative manner to stabilize gain is far from obvious. One of the most powerfully illustrative examples I know of is the use of negative feedback in a voltage regulator circuit to compensate for the base-emitter voltage drop of 0.7 volts (see question file #02286).</p>
<p>This is a misconception that seems to have an amazing resistance to correction. There seem to always be a few students who think that there is a direct path for current from the input terminals of an opamp to its output terminal. It is very important to realize that <em>for most practical purposes, an opamp draws negligible current through its input terminals!</em> What current does go through the output terminal is <em>always</em> supplied by the terminals and from the power supply, never by the input signal(s). To put this into colloquial terms, the input terminals on an opamp tell the output what to do, but they do not give the output its &quot;muscle&quot; (current) to do it.</p>
<p>I think the reason for this misconception is the fact that power terminals are often omitted from opamp symbols for brevity, and after a while of seeing this it is easy to forget they are really still there performing a useful function!</p>
