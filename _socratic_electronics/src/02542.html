<p>Now, determine the output voltage of the same circuit with a Schottky diode (0.4 volts typical forward drop) instead of a silicon PN junction diode:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02542x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Now, determine the output voltage of the same circuit with a light-emitting diode (1.7 volts typical forward drop):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02542x03.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Comment on these three circuits’ output voltages: what does this indicate about the effect of the diode’s voltage drop on the opamp output?</p>
<p>In both circuits, the output voltage is precisely -2 volts.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: what <em>is</em> different within these three circuits, if not the output voltage?</p>
<p>By itself, these circuits are fairly useless. Their purpose is to prepare students to understand how precision rectifier circuits work, by showing how negative feedback makes the diode’s forward voltage drop irrelevant. This is another example of the power of negative feedback, and an essential concept for understanding all precise (opamp-driven) diode circuits.</p>
