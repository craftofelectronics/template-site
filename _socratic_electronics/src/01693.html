<p>You may use circuit simulation software to set up similar oscilloscope display interpretation scenarios, for practice or for verification of what you see in this exercise.</p>
<p>Use a sine-wave function generator for the AC voltage source, and be sure set the frequency to some reasonable value (well within the capability of a multimeter to measure). It is very important that students learn to convert between peak and RMS measurements for sine waves, but you might want to mix things up a bit by having them do the same with triangle waves and square waves as well! It is vital that students realize the rule of <span class="math">$V_{RMS} = {V_{peak} \over \sqrt{2}}$</span> only holds for <em>sinusoidal</em> signals.</p>
<p>If you do choose to challenge students with non-sinusoidal waveshapes, be very sure that they do their voltmeter measurements using <em>true-RMS</em> meters! This means no analog voltmeters, which are &quot;miscalibrated&quot; so their inherently average-responding movements register (sinusoidal) RMS accurately. Your students must use true-RMS digital voltmeters in order for their non-sinusoidal RMS measurements to correlate with their calculations.</p>
<p>Incidentally, this lab exercise also works well as a demonstration of the importance of true-RMS indicating meters, comparing the indications of analog, non-true-RMS digital, and true-RMS digital on the same non-sinusoidal waveform!</p>
