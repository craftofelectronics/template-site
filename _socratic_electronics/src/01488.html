<p>What would happen to the magnetic flux inside an air-core inductor made of superconducting wire (no electrical resistance at all), if a constant DC voltage were applied to that coil? Remember, this is an ideal scenario, where the only mathematical function describing the resulting flux is that which relates magnetic flux to voltage and time!</p>
<p>Ideally, the flux would increase from zero in a linear fashion over time.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: what would happen with an <em>iron-cored</em> inductor, with the same superconducting (zero-resistance) wire?</p>
<p>Discuss with your students why the flux increases linearly, as described by Faradayâ€™s Law of electromagnetic induction. When discussing the iron-core scenario, be sure to mention magnetic saturation if your students have not considered it!</p>
