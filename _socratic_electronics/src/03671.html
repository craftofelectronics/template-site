<p>Research and describe what the <em>Hall effect</em> is, and list some practical uses of it.</p>
<p>There are many good references describing the nature and discovery of the Hall effect. I’ll let you find this on your own!</p>
<p>Practical applications of the Hall effect include magnetic field measurement, non-contact current measurement, position sensors, and analog computation.</p>
<p>One of the most interesting applications of the Hall effect I’ve ever seen was an analog <em>multiplier</em>, which output a voltage signal proportional to the product of two input signals. In the specific example I saw, the two input signals were voltage and current for an AC load, the output of the Hall element representing instantaneous load <em>power</em>. A precise fraction of the AC load current passed through the Hall element, while a precise fraction of the AC load voltage energized a coil to generate a magnetic field flux perpendicular to the current (through the Hall element).</p>
