<p>A set of batteries are connected in parallel to form a battery bank. Ideally, their individual voltages would be exactly equal, and there would be no stray resistance anywhere in the circuit, but in reality what we have is something like this:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00474x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Use Millman’s theorem to calculate the total voltage between the two busses for the battery bank, given these specifications for the four batteries:</p>
<p><span class="math"></span><span class="math"></span></p>
<p>Bus voltage = 12.051 V</p>
<p>Millman’s theorem is especially useful in making bus voltage calculations for power systems, where multiple sources (and loads!) are connected to the same two wires.</p>
