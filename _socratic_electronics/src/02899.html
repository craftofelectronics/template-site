<p>Complete the timing diagram, showing the state of the <span class="math"><em>Q</em></span> output over time as the Set and Reset switches are actuated. Assume that <span class="math"><em>Q</em></span> begins in the low state on power-up:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02899x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02899x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Follow-up question: complete a schematic diagram showing how the <span class="math">$\overline{Q}$</span> output of the latch could turn on an electric motor through a bipolar junction transistor. Also, determine whether the latch circuit would be <em>sourcing</em> or <em>sinking</em> current to the transistor when the motor is running:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02899x03.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Nothing special here in this question. Perhaps the main point is to familiarize students with the concept of a timing diagram, and how to transfer the truth table function of a specific logic circuit to a time-domain plot.</p>
