<p>Electric current is measured in the unit of the <em>ampere</em>, or <em>amp</em>. What is the physical definition for this unit? What fundamental quantities constitute 1 ampere of electric current?</p>
<p>1 ampere of electric current is the rate of electron motion equal to 1 coulomb per second:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$I = {Q \over t}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Where,</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>I</em> = </span> Electric current (amperes)</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>Q</em> = </span> Charge in motion (coulombs)</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>t</em> = </span> Time (seconds)</p>
<p>It may be helpful at this point to review the number of electrons constituting one coulomb of charge: <span class="math">6. 25 × 10<sup>18</sup></span> electrons.</p>
<p>Technically, current’s mathematical definition involves calculus:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$I = {dQ \over dt}$</span><br /></p>
<p>However, students at this stage may not be ready to explore derivatives yet, and so the equation give in the answer for (average) current will suffice.</p>
