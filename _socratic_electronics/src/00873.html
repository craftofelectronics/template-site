<p>What does the phrase <em>open-loop voltage gain</em> mean with reference to an operational amplifier? For a typical opamp, this gain figure is extremely high. Why is it important that the open-loop voltage gain be high when using an opamp as a comparator?</p>
<p>&quot;Open-loop voltage gain&quot; simply refers to the differential voltage gain of the amplifier, without any connections &quot;feeding back&quot; the amplifierâ€™s output signal to one or more of its inputs. A high gain figure means that a very small differential voltage is able to drive the amplifier into saturation.</p>
<p>The word &quot;saturation&quot; is used often in electronics, especially in reference to amplifiers. Discuss the meaning and significance of this term with your students, especially in reference to comparator circuits, where the opamp is being used simply to compare to voltages and tell which one is greater.</p>
