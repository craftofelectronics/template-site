<p>Use the Superposition Theorem to calculate the amount of current going through the 55 <span class="math">Ω </span> heater element. Ignore all wire and connection resistances, only considering the resistance of each fuse in addition to the heater element resistance:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03129x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math"><em>I</em><sub><em>h</em><em>e</em><em>a</em><em>t</em><em>e</em><em>r</em></sub> = </span> 4.439 A</p>
<p>Follow-up question: explain how you could use the Superposition Theorem to calculate current going through the short length of wire connecting the two generators together:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03129x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Though there are other methods of analysis for this circuit, it is still a good application of Superposition Theorem.</p>
