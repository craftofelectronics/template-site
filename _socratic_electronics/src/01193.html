<p>A common means of biasing a depletion-type IGFET is called <em>zero biasing</em>. An example circuit is shown below:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01193x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>This may appear similar to <em>self-biasing</em> as seen with JFET amplifier circuits, but it is not. Zero biasing only works with IGFET amplifier circuits. Explain why this is so.</p>
<p>The natural Q-point of a depletion-type IGFET occurs with a gate-to-source voltage of 0 volts. This is very different from either bipolar junction (BJT) or junction field-effect (JFET) transistors.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: will &quot;zero&quot; biasing work with enhancement-mode IGFETs as well? Explain why or why not.</p>
<p>This question provides students with an opportunity to review IGFET theory, and to differentiate between depletion-mode and enhancement-mode types, which is a subject of much confusion among students new to the topic.</p>
