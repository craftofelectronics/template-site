<p>When performing tests on a radio transmitter, it is often necessary to do so without actually broadcasting a signal through an antenna. In such scenarios, an equivalent <em>resistor</em> is connected to the output of the transmitter instead of an actual antenna. If chosen properly, the resistor &quot;looks&quot; the same as an antenna from the perspective of the transmitter.</p>
<p>Explain how this is possible, since real antennae are built to have as little resistance as possible. How can a <em>resistor</em> adequately substitute for an antenna, which is nothing like a resistor in either construction or purpose?</p>
<p>Although an antenna has little actual resistance, it does radiate energy into space, just like a resistor dissipates energy in the form of heat. The only significant difference is that an antennaâ€™s radiation is in the form of electromagnetic waves at the same frequency as the transmitter output.</p>
<p>Ask your students what criteria they think a resistor needs to meet in order to properly serve as a &quot;dummy&quot; antenna. Discuss impedance, Q factor, power rating, etc.</p>
