<p>Suppose an AC signal amplifier circuit has a voltage gain (ratio) of 2. That is, <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>o</em><em>u</em><em>t</em></sub></span> is twice as large as <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>i</em><em>n</em></sub></span>:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00826x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>If we were to try to rate this amplifierâ€™s gain in terms of the relative <em>power</em> dissipated by a given load resistance (<span class="math"><em>P</em><sub><em>l</em><em>o</em><em>a</em><em>d</em></sub></span> when powered by <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>o</em><em>u</em><em>t</em></sub></span>, versus <span class="math"><em>P</em><sub><em>l</em><em>o</em><em>a</em><em>d</em></sub></span> when powered by <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>i</em><em>n</em></sub></span>), what ratio would we calculate? In other words, what is the ratio of power for a given load resistance, when powered by a given voltage, versus when powered by a voltage that is twice as much?</p>
<p>Power ratio = 4:1</p>
<p>An easy way to illustrate this principle is to ask your students to calculate the power dissipation of a 1200 watt heating element rated for 120 volts, if connected to a 240 volt source. The answer is <em>not</em> 2400 watts!</p>
