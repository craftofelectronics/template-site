<p>Which of these two designs would be more suitable for use in a DC voltmeter circuit (amplifying a measured DC voltage)? What applications would the <em>other</em> amplifier design be suited for?</p>
<p>The direct-coupled amplifier circuit’s bandwidth extends down to 0 Hz, unlike the other amplifier. This makes it suitable for DC signal amplification. The capacitive-coupled amplifier circuit would be better suited for applications where AC signals are solely dealt with.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: in each of these amplifier circuits, identify the point at which the signal’s phase becomes shifted by 180<span class="math">$^{o}$</span>. In other words, show where the voltage signal becomes inverted, and then inverted again, so that the output is in phase with the input.</p>
<p>A good question to ask your students is, &quot;What is <em>bandwidth</em>?&quot; It is important that your students understand the basic concept of &quot;bandwidth&quot;, and what factors influence it in a circuit.</p>
<p>Ask your students to suggest possible values (in microfarads) for the coupling capacitor in the second circuit, based on common resistor values (between 1 k<span class="math">Ω </span> and 100 k<span class="math">Ω </span>), and a modest audio frequency range (1 kHz to 20 kHz). No exact values are needed here, but it is important that they be able to make an approximate estimation of the necessary (minimum) capacitance, if for no other reason than to demonstrate their comprehension of the coupling capacitor’s intended purpose.</p>
