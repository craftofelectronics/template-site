<p>Define what a <em>common-collector</em> transistor amplifier circuit is. What distinguishes this amplifier configuration from the other single-BJT amplifier configurations, namely <em>common-emitter</em> and <em>common-base</em>?</p>
<p>Also, describe the typical gains (voltage and current) of this amplifier configuration, and whether it is <em>inverting</em> or <em>noninverting</em>.</p>
<p>The common-collector amplifier configuration is defined by having the input and output signals referenced to the base and emitter terminals (respectively), with the collector terminal of the transistor typically having a low AC impedance to ground and thus being &quot;common&quot; to one pole of both the input and output voltages.</p>
<p>Common-collector amplifiers are characterized by high current gains, voltage gains of 1 or (slightly) less, and a noninverting phase relationship between input and output.</p>
<p>The answers to the question may be easily found in any fundamental electronics text, but it is important to ensure students know <em>why</em> these characteristics are such. I always like to tell my students, &quot;Memory <em>will</em> fail you, so you need to build an understanding of <em>why</em> things are, not just <em>what</em> things are.&quot;</p>
