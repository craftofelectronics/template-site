<p>The storage of electric charge in a capacitor is often likened to the storage of water in a vessel:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00188x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Complete this analogy, relating the electrical quantities of charge (<span class="math"><em>Q</em></span>), voltage (<span class="math"><em>E</em></span> or <span class="math"><em>V</em></span>), and capacitance (<span class="math"><em>C</em></span>) to the quantities of water height, water volume, and vessel dimensions.</p>
<p>Electrical charge <span class="math"> ≡ </span> Water volume</p>
<p>Voltage <span class="math"> ≡ </span> Height of water column in vessel</p>
<p>Capacitance <span class="math"> ≡ </span> Area of vessel, measured on a cross-section with a horizontal plane</p>
<p>Many students find this a helpful analogy of capacitor action. But it helps even more if students work together to <em>build</em> the analogy, and to truly understand it.</p>
<p>Perform some &quot;thought experiments&quot; with vessels of different size, relating the outcomes to charge storage in capacitors of different size.</p>
