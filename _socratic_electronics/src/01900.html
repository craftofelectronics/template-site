<p>According to the &quot;Ohm’s Law&quot; formula for a capacitor, capacitor current is proportional to the <em>time-derivative</em> of capacitor voltage:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$i = C {dv \over dt}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Another way of saying this is to state that the capacitors <em>differentiate</em> voltage with respect to time, and express this <em>time-derivative</em> of voltage as a current.</p>
<p>Suppose we had an oscilloscope capable of directly measuring current, or at least a current-to-voltage converter that we could attach to one of the probe inputs to allow direct measurement of current on one channel. With such an instrument set-up, we could directly plot capacitor voltage and capacitor current together on the same display:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01900x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>For each of the following voltage waveforms (channel B), plot the corresponding capacitor current waveform (channel A) as it would appear on the oscilloscope screen:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01900x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01900x03.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01900x04.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Note: the amplitude of your current plots is arbitrary. What I’m interested in here is the <em>shape</em> of each current waveform!</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01900x05.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01900x06.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01900x07.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Follow-up question: what electronic device could perform the function of a &quot;current-to-voltage converter&quot; so we could use an oscilloscope to measure capacitor current? Be as specific as you can in your answer.</p>
<p>Here, I ask students to relate the instantaneous rate-of-change of the voltage waveform to the instantaneous amplitude of the current waveform. Just a conceptual exercise in derivatives.</p>
