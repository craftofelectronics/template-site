<p>Suppose you are an electrician, and you need to disconnect the power conductors from a large electric motor. What steps should you take to ensure no shock hazard exists prior to touching the bare conductors?</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Turn the motor off (using the start/stop switch).</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Shut off the circuit breaker (or disconnect switch) providing electrical power to the motor.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Lock and tag the circuit breaker (or disconnect switch) so no one else will turn it on in your absence.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Check the operation of a voltmeter by connecting it to a known source of voltage.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Check for the presence of voltage at the conductor terminations with a voltmeter.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Re-check the operation of a voltmeter by connecting it to a known source of voltage.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> As a final step, touch the bare conductor with the <em>back</em> of your right hand, before touching it in any other way.</p>
<p>Follow-up questions:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Why check the voltmeter both before and after testing for voltage at the motor connections?</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Why touch the conductor with the back of your hand? What does it matter which side of your hand should touch the bare conductor?</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Why use your right hand? Why not your left?</p>
<p>A lot of electrical safety principles are covered in this one question. Be sure to spend adequate time with the follow-up questions, to be sure students understand exactly why the given steps are necessary to ensure safety.</p>
