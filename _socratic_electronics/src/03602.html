<p>You do not have to go into great detail with your explanation. I am only looking for a general description of what the Superposition Theorem is, which you can probably explain in two sentences or less.</p>
<p>When we apply the Superposition Theorem, we consider each power source one at a time, replacing all other power sources with their respective internal resistances. Then, we take all the voltage and current values calculated for the components under these single-source conditions and sum them up, yielding the voltage and current values when all sources are in effect.</p>
