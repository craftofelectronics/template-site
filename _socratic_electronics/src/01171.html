<p>This is a very common opamp oscillator circuit, technically of the <em>relaxation</em> type:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01171x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Explain how this circuit works, and what waveforms will be measured at points A and B. Be sure to make reference to <em>RC time constants</em> in your explanation.</p>
<p>You will measure a sawtooth-like waveform at point A, and a square wave at point B.</p>
<p>Challenge question: explain how you might go about calculating the frequency of such a circuit, based on what you know about RC time constant circuits. Assume that the opamp can swing its output rail-to-rail, for simplicity.</p>
<p>This circuit is best understood by building and testing. If you use large capacitor values and/or a large-value resistor in the capacitorâ€™s current path, the oscillation will be slow enough to analyze with a voltmeter rather than an oscilloscope.</p>
