<p>You should know that a capacitor is formed by two conductive plates separated by an electrically insulating material. As such, there is no &quot;ohmic&quot; path for electrons to flow between the plates. This may be vindicated by an ohmmeter measurement, which tells us a capacitor has (nearly) infinite resistance once it is charged to the ohmmeter’s full output voltage.</p>
<p>Explain then, how a capacitor is able to continuously pass <em>alternating</em> current, even though it cannot continuously pass DC.</p>
<p>I’ll let you figure this out on your own!</p>
<p>This feature of capacitors is extremely useful in electronic circuitry. Your students will find many applications of it later on in their studies!</p>
