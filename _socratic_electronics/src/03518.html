<p>Identify two different component values that could be changed in this circuit to make the time constant <em>longer</em> (creating a <em>slower</em> circuit response):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03518x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Be sure to identify both the components and the directions their respective values must be changed (<em>larger</em> or <em>smaller</em>).</p>
<p>Make <span class="math"><em>R</em></span> <em>larger</em>. Make <span class="math"><em>C</em></span> <em>larger</em>.</p>
<p>I recommend assigning two points to each properly identified component, and two points for each proper direction of change.</p>
