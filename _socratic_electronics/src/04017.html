<p>Explain the operating principle of a <em>dual-slope</em> ADC circuit, in your own words.</p>
<p>I wonâ€™t give away all the details here, but the dual-slope converter uses the same integrator and binary counter that the single-slope ADC does. However, the integrator is used a bit differently in the dual-slope design, the benefits being greater immunity to high-frequency noise on the input signal and greater accuracy due to relative insensitivity to integrator component values.</p>
<p>Tutorials abound on simple ADC strategies, so your students should have little problem locating an adequate explanation for the operation of a dual-slope ADC.</p>
