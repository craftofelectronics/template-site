<p>Suppose you pick up a piece of electrical wire and notice this label printed on the insulation:</p>
<p>14 AWG MTW</p>
<p>What does this label tell you about the wire?</p>
<p>This label indicates the gauge of the wire (14 AWG) and the type of insulation (MTW) it has. You didnâ€™t think I would just tell you what &quot;MTW&quot; meant, did you?</p>
<p>It is important that students know where to look for information like this, because they will surely come across unique wire types in their later experience, and will need to know how to identify the wire.</p>
