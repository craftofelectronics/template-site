<p>Using a B-H curve obtained from a reference book, determine the amount of magnetizing force (<span class="math"><em>H</em></span>) required to establish a magnetic flux density of 0.2 T in a cast iron torus with a cross-sectional area of <span class="math">7 × 10<sup> − 4</sup></span> square meters.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00686x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Calculate the amount of current necessary in the wire coil to establish this amount of flux, if the coil has 250 turns, and the torus has an average flux path length of 45 cm. Also, calculate the amount of magnetic flux (<span class="math">Φ </span>) inside the torus.</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>H</em> = </span> 400 At/m</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>I</em> = </span> 720 mA</p>
<p><span class="math">Φ  = </span> 0.14 mWb</p>
<p>I obtained the magnetizing force figure of 400 At/m for 0.2 T of flux density, from Robert L. Boylestad’s 9th edition of , page 437.</p>
