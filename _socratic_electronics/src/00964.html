<p>One way to reap the advantages of negative feedback enjoyed in common-collector amplifier circuits, in a common-emitter amplifier, is to add components that intentionally &quot;feed back&quot; some of the output signal to the transistor’s input in a <em>degenerative</em> fashion:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00964x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Explain what the term <em>negative</em> (or <em>degenerative</em>) means with reference to feedback, and explain how each of these techniques works to produce this type of feedback. Also, explain one <em>disadvantage</em> of applying negative feedback to a common-emitter amplifier circuit.</p>
<p>&quot;Negative&quot; or &quot;degenerative&quot; feedback means that any change on the output gets &quot;fed back&quot; in such a way that it tries to cancel itself.</p>
<p>The use of an emitter resistor (<span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>E</em></sub></span>) simply makes the amplifier circuit look more like a common-collector configuration, and the feedback functions in the same way. The use of a &quot;feedback&quot; resistor (<span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>f</em></sub></span>) takes advantage of the common-emitter’s inverting nature, the output signal being 180<span class="math">$^{o}$</span> out of phase with the input.</p>
<p>Applying negative feedback to a common-emitter amplifier has the effect of decreasing its voltage gain.</p>
<p>Negative feedback is a vitally important principle for electronics students to understand. It is the basis of almost every type of control system, and it makes standardized amplifier design possible. Take as much time as necessary to discuss this with your students, and to make sure they understand how and why negative feedback works as it does.</p>
<p>Be sure to discuss the twin effects of negative feedback: increased voltage gain stability, and decreased voltage gain. Ask your students why anyone would want their amplifier circuit to suffer a loss of voltage gain just for the sake of gain stability. Why is the stability if voltage gain important?</p>
