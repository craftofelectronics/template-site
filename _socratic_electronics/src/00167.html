<p>Design a circuit to test the breakdown voltage of a material.</p>
<p>I wonâ€™t provide you with a ready-made schematic diagram for such a circuit, but I will give you a hint. If a substance were to be subjected to a voltage in excess of its dielectric strength, what effect(s) would indicate breakdown?</p>
<p>Designs for testing dielectric strength may range from the crude to the sophisticated, but the real point of this question is to challenge students to reason from the effects of high-voltage breakdown to a means of detecting when that takes place, and measuring the voltage needed for it to happen.</p>
