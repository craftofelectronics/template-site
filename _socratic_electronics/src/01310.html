<p>A <em>Karnaugh map</em> is nothing more than a special form of truth table, useful for reducing logic functions into minimal Boolean expressions.</p>
<p>Here is a truth table for a specific four-input logic circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01310x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Complete the following Karnaugh map, according to the values found in the above truth table:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01310x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01310x03.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Showing students that Karnaugh maps are really nothing more than truth tables in disguise helps them to more readily learn this powerful new tool.</p>
