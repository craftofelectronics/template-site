<p>Use circuit simulation software to verify your predicted and actual truth tables.</p>
<p>Students are to research the datasheet for their particular IC and figure out from that what connections and timing sequences they need to make the circuit perform as requested. It is very important for students to learn to interpret manufacturersâ€™ datasheets!</p>
<p>I recommend a slow clock frequency (1 Hz or so) to allow for easy viewing of the shift patterns. To conserve the number of necessary input switches, I allow students to hard-wire the data inputs (<span class="math"><em>D</em><sub>0</sub></span> through <span class="math"><em>D</em><sub>3</sub></span>). This means they only need switches to control the mode of the shift register (parallel load, shift right, shift left, and shift inhibit).</p>
