<p>The <span class="math"><em>Q</em></span>, or <em>quality factor</em>, of an inductor circuit is defined by the following equation, where <span class="math"><em>X</em><sub><em>s</em></sub></span> is the series inductive reactance and <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>s</em></sub></span> is the series resistance:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$Q = {X_s \over R_{s}}$</span><br /></p>
<p>We also know that we may convert between series and parallel equivalent AC networks with the following conversion equations:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$R_{s} R_{p} = Z^2 \hbox{\hskip 40pt} X_{s} X_{p} = Z^2$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02096x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Series and parallel LR networks, if truly equivalent, should share the same <span class="math"><em>Q</em></span> factor as well as sharing the same impedance. Develop an equation that solves for the <span class="math"><em>Q</em></span> factor of a <em>parallel</em> LR circuit.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$Q = {R_p \over X_p}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Follow-up question: what condition gives the greatest value for <span class="math"><em>Q</em></span>, a low parallel resistance or a high parallel resistance? Contrast this against the effects of low versus high resistance in a series LR circuit, and explain both scenarios.</p>
<p>This is primarily an exercise in algebraic substitution, but it also challenges students to think deeply about the nature of <span class="math"><em>Q</em></span> and what it means, especially in the follow-up question.</p>
