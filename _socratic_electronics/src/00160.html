<p>What does the <em>breakdown voltage</em> (also known as <em>dielectric strength</em>) rating for an electrically insulating substance mean?</p>
<p>The breakdown voltage, or dielectric strength, rating of an insulator is the maximum amount of applied voltage it may withstand per unit thickness without conducting appreciable current.</p>
<p>This question provides an opportunity for &quot;qualitative&quot; analysis: does the voltage rating of an insulator increase or decrease as its thickness is increased, given a constant dielectric strength?</p>
