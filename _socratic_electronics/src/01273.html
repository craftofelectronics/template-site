<p>In CMOS circuitry, one side of the DC power supply is usually labeled as &quot;<span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>D</em><em>D</em></sub></span>&quot;, while the other side is labeled as &quot;<span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>S</em><em>S</em></sub></span>&quot;. Why is this? What do the subscripts &quot;DD&quot; and &quot;SS&quot; represent?</p>
<p>The labels <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>D</em><em>D</em></sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>S</em><em>S</em></sub></span> are supposed to mean &quot;power supply to <em>drain</em> and <em>source</em> sides of MOSFETs, respectively. This nomenclature is actually a holdover from obsolete NMOS gate designs, which used N-channel MOSFETS exclusively. Even though it doesn’t make much sense in CMOS circuits (you’ll see why if you examine the internal schematic diagram for a CMOS gate), it is the standard way of denoting power supply terminals for CMOS circuits.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: what polarities do these respective labels represent?</p>
<p>Ahhh, the vestiges of yesterday’s technology! What can I say? Sometimes terms &quot;stick&quot; even when it makes little sense for them to.</p>
