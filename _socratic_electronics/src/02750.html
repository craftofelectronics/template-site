<p><span class="math">$V_{AC} = \hbox{\underbar{ \hskip 20pt}}$</span> (red lead on <strong>A</strong>, black lead on <strong>C</strong>)</p>
<p><span class="math">$V_{DB} = \hbox{\underbar{ \hskip 20pt}}$</span> (red lead on <strong>D</strong>, black lead on <strong>B</strong>)</p>

<p>Discuss with your students multiple techniques of solving for these voltages, asking them first for their solution strategies.</p>
