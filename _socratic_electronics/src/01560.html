<p>In a simple resistor circuit, the current may be calculated by dividing applied voltage by resistance:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01560x03.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Although an analysis of this circuit probably seems trivial to you, I would like to encourage you to look at what is happening here from a fresh perspective. An important principle observed many times in the study of physics is that of <em>equilibrium</em>, where quantities naturally &quot;seek&quot; a state of balance. The balance sought by this simple circuit is equality of voltage: the voltage across the resistor must settle at the same value as the voltage output by the source:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01560x04.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>If the resistor is viewed as a source of voltage seeking equilibrium with the voltage source, then current <em>must</em> converge at whatever value necessary to generate the necessary balancing voltage across the resistor, according to Ohm’s Law (<span class="math"><em>V</em> = <em>I</em><em>R</em></span>). In other words, <em>the resistor’s current achieves whatever magnitude it has to in order to generate a voltage drop equal to the voltage of the source</em>.</p>
<p>This may seem like a strange way of analyzing such a simple circuit, with the resistor &quot;seeking&quot; to generate a voltage drop equal to the source, and current &quot;magically&quot; assuming whatever value it must to achieve that voltage equilibrium, but it is helpful in understanding other types of circuit elements.</p>
<p>For example, here we have a source of DC voltage connected to a large coil of wire through a switch. Assume that the wire coil has negligible resistance (<span class="math">0 Ω </span>):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01560x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Like the resistor circuit, the coil will &quot;seek&quot; to achieve voltage equilibrium with the voltage source once the switch is closed. However, we know that the voltage induced in a coil is not directly proportional to current as it is with a resistor – instead, a coil’s voltage drop is proportional to the <em>rate of change of magnetic flux over time</em> as described by Faraday’s Law of electromagnetic induction:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$v_{coil} = N {d \phi \over dt}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Where,</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>v</em><sub><em>c</em><em>o</em><em>i</em><em>l</em></sub> = </span> Instantaneous induced voltage, in volts</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>N</em> = </span> Number of turns in wire coil</p>
<p><span class="math">${d \phi \over dt} =$</span> Instantaneous rate of change of magnetic flux, in webers per second</p>
<p>Assuming a linear relationship between coil current and magnetic flux (i.e. <span class="math"><em>ϕ</em></span> doubles when <span class="math"><em>i</em></span> doubles), describe this simple circuit’s current over time after the switch closes.</p>
<p>When the switch closes, current will steadily increase at a linear rate over time:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01560x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Challenge question: real wire coils contain electrical resistance (unless they’re made of superconducting wire, of course), and we know how voltage equilibrium occurs in resistive circuits: the current converges at a value necessary for the resistance to drop an equal amount of voltage as the source. Describe, then, what the current does in a circuit with a <em>real</em> wire coil, not a superconducting wire coil.</p>
<p>Students who do not yet understand the concept of inductance may be inclined to suggest that the current in this circuit will be infinite, following Ohm’s Law (<span class="math"><em>I</em> = <em>E</em> / <em>R</em></span>). One of the purposes of this question is to reveal such misunderstandings, so that they may be corrected.</p>
<p>This circuit provides an excellent example of the calculus principle <em>integration</em>, where the application of a steady voltage across the inductor results in a steadily <em>increasing</em> current. Whether or not you should touch on this subject depends on the mathematical aptitude of your students.</p>
