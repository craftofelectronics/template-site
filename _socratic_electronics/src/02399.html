<p>Explain why &quot;switching&quot; regulator circuits are more efficient than their &quot;linear&quot; counterparts. What is it, exactly, that allows a switching regulator circuit to operate more efficiently than a regulator circuit that uses a variable resistance to regulate the output?</p>
<p>Switching power conversion circuits operate their transistors in opposite conditions of cutoff and saturation so that there is very little power dissipated by the transistor in either state. Linear regulators, on the other hand, regulate by wasting power in a resistance (usually a transistor).</p>
