<p>An important consideration when working around circuits containing MOSFETs is <em>electrostatic discharge</em>, or <em>ESD</em>. Describe what this phenomenon is, and why it is an important consideration for MOSFET circuits.</p>
<p>&quot;Electrostatic discharge&quot; is the application of very high voltages to circuit components as a result of contact or proximity with an electrically charged body, such as a human being. The high voltages exhibited by static electricity are very damaging to MOSFETs. I’ll let you research why!</p>
<p>Be sure to ask students to explain the mechanism of transistor damage resulting from ESD, and to discuss the sheer magnitude of static voltages typically generated in dry-air conditions. If you have any microphotographs of IC damage from ESD, present a few of them during discussion time for your students’ viewing pleasure.</p>
