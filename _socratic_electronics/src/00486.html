<p>The cross-sectional dimensions of a copper &quot;busbar&quot; measure 8 cm by 2.5 cm. How much resistance would this busbar have, measured end-to-end, if its length is 10 meters? Assume a temperature of 20<span class="math">$^{o}$</span> Celsius.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00486x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>83.9 <span class="math"><em>μ</em>Ω </span></p>
<p>This question is a good review of the metric system, relating centimeters to meters, and such. It may also be a good review of unit conversions, if students choose to do their resistance calculations using English units (cmils, or square inches) rather than metric.</p>
<p>Students may be surprised at the low resistance figure, but remind them that they are dealing with a solid bar of copper, over 3 square inches in cross-sectional area. <em>This is one big conductor!</em></p>
