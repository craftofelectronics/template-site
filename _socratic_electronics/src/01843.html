<p>Will the current through the resistor increase or decrease as the capacitor plates are moved closer together?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01843x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Explain why this happens, with reference to capacitive reactance (<span class="math"><em>X</em><sub><em>C</em></sub></span>).</p>
<p>The current will <em>increase</em>.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: combine the physical capacitance equation and the capacitive reactance equation together to form a new equation that solves for reactance (<span class="math"><em>X</em><sub><em>C</em></sub></span>) given all the physical specifications of the capacitor (plate area, spacing, and permittivity) and the applied frequency:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$C = {\epsilon A \over d} \hbox{\hskip 40pt} X_C = {1 \over {2 \pi f C}}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Students might be able to guess the correct answer even if they know nothing about capacitive reactance, just by assuming that closer plates means a more complete circuit. The real answer is more complex than this, though, and that is what you must draw out of the discussion with them.</p>
