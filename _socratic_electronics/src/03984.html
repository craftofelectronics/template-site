<p>Latch circuits such as the S-R latch and the D latch are often referred to as <em>transparent</em> digital devices. Explain what this term means, and why latches are classified as such.</p>
<p>A &quot;transparent&quot; digital device is one whose outputs immediately and asynchronously (transparently) follow the input signal(s) when enabled. By contrast, many other digital devices are <em>synchronous</em>, meaning their outputs follow the inputs only at specified times (at the command of a &quot;clock&quot; signal).</p>
<p>The term &quot;transparent&quot; becomes more meaningful when latches and flip-flops are compared with one another.</p>
