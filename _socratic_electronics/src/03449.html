<p>Something is wrong with this circuit. Based on the oscilloscopeâ€™s display, determine whether the battery or the function generator is faulty:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03449x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The function generator is faulty.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: explain how this problem could be created simply by connecting the function generator to the circuit with the ground on the left-hand clip instead of the right-hand clip where it should be.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03449x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>This question challenges students to apply their knowledge of AC+DC mixed signals to oscilloscope display patterns, in order to determine whether it is the battery or the function generator which has failed.</p>
