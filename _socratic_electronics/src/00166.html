<p>What size (gauge) of copper wire is needed in this circuit to ensure the load receives at least 110 volts?</p>

<p>#6 gauge copper wire comes close, but is not quite large enough. #5 gauge or larger will suffice.</p>
<p>Several steps are necessary to solve this problem: Ohmâ€™s Law, algebraic manipulation of the specific resistance equation, and research into wire sizes. Be sure to spend adequate time discussing this problem with your students!</p>
<p>The concept of a generic &quot;load&quot; is any component or device that dissipates electrical power in a circuit. Often, generic loads are symbolized by a resistor symbol (a zig-zag line), even though they might not really be a resistor.</p>
