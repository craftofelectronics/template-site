<p>Use circuit simulation software to verify your predicted and measured parameter values.</p>
<p>I recommend students use a normal regulated (voltage) power supply, adjusting the output voltage until the output current is at 4 mA. 1 k<span class="math">Ω </span> resistors work well for this circuit, requiring only 6.4 volts from the power supply to achieve 4 mA total current.</p>
<p>An extension of this exercise is to incorporate troubleshooting questions. Whether using this exercise as a performance assessment or simply as a concept-building lab, you might want to follow up your students’ results by asking them to predict the consequences of certain circuit faults.</p>
