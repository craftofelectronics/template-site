<p>One of the first popular operational amplifiers was manufactured by Philbrick Researches, and it was called the K2-W. Built with two dual-triode vacuum tubes, its original schematic diagram looked like this:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02590x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>To make this opamp circuit easier for modern students to understand, Iâ€™ll substitute equivalent solid-state components for all tubes in the original design:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02590x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Explain the configuration (common-source, common-drain, or common-gate) of each transistor in the modernized schematic, identifying the function of each in the operational amplifier circuit.</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>Q</em><sub>1</sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>Q</em><sub>2</sub></span> form a <em>differential pair</em>, outputting a signal proportional to the difference in voltage between the two inputs. <span class="math"><em>Q</em><sub>3</sub></span> is a (bypassed) common-source voltage amplifier, while <span class="math"><em>Q</em><sub>4</sub></span> is a source-follower (common-drain), providing voltage gain and current gain, respectively.</p>
<p>The answer as given is incomplete. One could elaborate more on the function of each transistor, and by doing so understand the original amplifier circuit a little better. Explore this circuit with your students, challenging them to follow through the logic of the design, trying to figure out what the designer(s) intended.</p>
<p>This question also provides the opportunity to draw parallels between D-type MOSFET operation and the behavior of triode-type vacuum tubes. As with D-type MOSFETs, triodes were &quot;normally half-on&quot; devices, whose plate-cathode current conduction could be enhanced or depleted by applying voltage to the grid (with respect to the cathode).</p>
