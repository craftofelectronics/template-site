<p>Use circuit simulation software to verify your predicted and measured parameter values.</p>
<p>You will need to provide some low-resistance specimens for your students to measure using this technique. Motor armature coils work well for this purpose, as do large power resistors with the labels scratched off.</p>
<p>When students set their power supplies for a certain amount of current, it is often helpful to have them do so while it is powering the resistor (rather than connecting their ammeter directly across the power supply to set its current output). This helps avoid the possibility of blowing the fuse in their ammeter!</p>
