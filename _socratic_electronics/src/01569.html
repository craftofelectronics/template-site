<p>Industrial <em>control power transformers</em> are used to step down 480 or 240 volts to a level more acceptable for relay control circuitry: usually 120 volts. Some control power transformers are built with multiple primary windings, to facilitate connection to either a 480 volt or 240 volt AC power source:</p>

<p>Such transformers are usually advertised as having &quot;240 <span class="math"> × </span> 480&quot; primary windings, the &quot;<span class="math"> × </span>&quot; symbol representing two independent windings with four connection points (H1 through H4).</p>
<p>Show the connections on the four &quot;H&quot; terminals necessary for 240 volt operation, and also for 480 volt operation, on the following illustrations:</p>

<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01569x03.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>This type of transformer is <em>very</em> common in industrial control systems. Discuss with your students why the primary winding terminals are arranged as they are (H1-H3-H2-H4), to facilitate near-terminal jumpering with metal clips.</p>
