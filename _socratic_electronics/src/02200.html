<p>This is a schematic diagram of a <em>Delta-connected</em> three-phase generator (with the rotor winding shown):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02200x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>How much AC current will each of the lines (<span class="math"><em>I</em><sub><em>A</em></sub></span>, <span class="math"><em>I</em><sub><em>B</em></sub></span>, or <span class="math"><em>I</em><sub><em>C</em></sub></span>) conduct to a load (not shown) if each stator coil inside the alternator outputs 17 amps of current?</p>
<p>Phase current = 17 amps AC (given)</p>
<p>Line current = <span class="math"><em>I</em><sub><em>A</em></sub> = <em>I</em><sub><em>B</em></sub> = <em>I</em><sub><em>C</em></sub> = </span> 29.4 amps AC</p>
<p>Follow-up question #1: what is the ratio between the line and phase current magnitudes in a Delta-connected three-phase system?</p>
<p>Follow-up question #2: what would happen to the output of this alternator if the rotor winding were to fail open? Bear in mind that the rotor winding is typically energized with DC through a pair of brushes and slip rings from an external source, the current through this winding being used to control voltage output of the alternator’s three-phase &quot;stator&quot; windings.</p>
<p>Students will quickly discover that <span class="math">$\sqrt{3}$</span> is the &quot;magic number&quot; for practically all balanced three-phase circuit calculations!</p>
<p>It should be noted that although the <em>magnitudes</em> of <span class="math"><em>I</em><sub><em>A</em></sub></span>, <span class="math"><em>I</em><sub><em>B</em></sub></span>, and <span class="math"><em>I</em><sub><em>C</em></sub></span> are equal, their phasor angles are most definitely not. Therefore,</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$I_A = I_B = I_C \hbox{\hskip 20pt Scalar values equal}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">${\bf I_A} \neq {\bf I_B} \neq {\bf I_C} \hbox{\hskip 20pt Phasors unequal}$</span><br /></p>
