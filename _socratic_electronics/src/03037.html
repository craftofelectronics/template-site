<p>One new technology entering the market is <em>organic light-emitting diodes</em>, or OLEDs. Describe what these are, and why they hold so much promise for electronic display device elements.</p>
<p>An &quot;organic&quot; LED is one made from organic (carbon-containing) molecules instead of crystalline silicon, gallium arsenide, or other more traditional semiconductor substances. One distinct advantage of these devices is their ease of manufacture, but Iâ€™ll let you research exactly why (as well as other advantages of these devices).</p>
<p>This question is destined for obsolescence, as organic LEDs will either become so popular as to lose their novelty (&quot;new technology&quot;) or become supplanted by something even better. But for now (May 2005), they are worthy of their own question in the Socratic Electronics project!</p>
