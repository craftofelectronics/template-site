<p>Complete this table, performing all necessary conversions between numeration systems. Truncate all answers to three characters past the point:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01210x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01210x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Lots of conversions to do here! I particularly like the &quot;table&quot; format shown here for practicing numeration system conversions, because it compresses a lot of practice into a small space on paper, and also because it allows students to use different methods of conversion. For example, in converting a decimal number to the other forms, a student might choose to convert first to binary, then from binary to octal and hex. Or, alternatively, a student may choose to convert from decimal into hex, then from hex into binary, then from binary to octal, the last two conversions being especially easy.</p>
