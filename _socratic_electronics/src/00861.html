<p>Calculate the impedance value necessary to balance this AC bridge, expressing your answer in both polar and rectangular forms:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00861x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Also, describe what sort of device might be appropriate to serve as a &quot;null detector&quot; to indicate when bridge balance has been achieved, and where this device would be connected to in the bridge circuit.</p>
<p><span class="math">${\bf Z} =$</span> 337.6 <span class="math">Ω </span> <span class="math">∠</span> -90<span class="math">$^{o}$</span> (polar form)</p>
<p><span class="math">${\bf Z} =$</span> 0 - j337.6 <span class="math">Ω </span> (rectangular form)</p>
<p>The simplest &quot;null detector&quot; for this type of AC bridge would be a sensitive pair of audio headphones, as 600 Hz is well within the audio range, and would be heard as a tone in the headphones.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: what type and size of component will provide this exact amount of impedance at 600 Hz?</p>
<p>So long as complex quantities are used, AC bridge circuits &quot;balance&quot; just the same way that DC bridge circuits balance. Consequently, this is really nothing new for your students if they’ve already studied DC Wheatstone bridge circuits.</p>
