<p>Shown here are two digital components: a D-type <em>latch</em> and a D-type <em>flip-flop</em>:</p>

<p>Other than the silly name, what distinguishes a &quot;flip-flop&quot; from a latch? How do the two circuits differ in function?</p>
<p>A &quot;flip-flop&quot; is a latch that changes output only at the rising or falling <em>edge</em> of the clock pulse.</p>
<p>Note to your students that the timing input of a flip-flop is called a <em>clock</em> rather than an <em>enable</em>. Ask them to identify what differences in symbolism show this distinction between the two devices.</p>
