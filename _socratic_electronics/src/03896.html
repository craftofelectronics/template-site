<p>Identify at least one fault that would cause the motor to turn off immediately once the &quot;Start&quot; pushbutton switch was released, instead of &quot;latch&quot; in the run mode as it should:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03896x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>For each of your proposed faults, explain <em>why</em> it will cause the described problem.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> M1 control contact failed open.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Wire(s) between M1 control contact and control circuit broken open.</p>
<p>This form of motor control circuit is <em>very</em> popular in industry. It is well worth your students’ time to study it and understand both how and why it works.</p>
