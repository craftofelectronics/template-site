<p>This motor-start circuit reduces the amount of &quot;inrush&quot; current when starting by inserting a resistance in series with the motor for a few seconds, then removing that resistance after the time delay to allow full speed operation. A time-delay relay provides the reduced-speed control.</p>

<p>The relay labeled &quot;M1&quot; is a large &quot;contactor&quot; designed to shunt the motorâ€™s current around the start-up resistor. It requires at least a few amps of current through its coil to energize.</p>
<p>The relay labeled &quot;CR1&quot; is a much smaller &quot;control relay,&quot; and its turn-on time is controlled by the charging of an electrolytic capacitor.</p>
<p>What could be adjusted in this circuit to make it switch to full-speed operation sooner after start-up?</p>
<p>The potentiometer could be adjusted to provide less resistance, in order to hasten the switch to &quot;full-speed&quot; mode after startup.</p>
<p>Challenge question: what else could be changed in this circuit to provide a shorter &quot;reduced speed&quot; time period?</p>
<p>This general principle is useful for the start-up of many different electric motors (including most AC motors). Circuits like this are sometimes referred to as <em>soft start</em> controls.</p>
<p>Ask your students to describe which way the potentiometer wiper needs to be moved in order to accommodate the resistance change.</p>
