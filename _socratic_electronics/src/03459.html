<p>What does the acronym <em>RF</em> stand form, in reference to radio-related electronics?</p>
<p>&quot;RF&quot; means <em>Radio Frequency</em>, implying a frequency of alternating current (AC) much greater than that encountered in AC power or audio circuitry.</p>
<p>Ask your students to list the frequencies of their favorite broadcast radio stations as an example of some radio frequencies. Show them a typical benchtop signal generator (non-RF) for comparison of frequency range, and they should begin to understand the concept.</p>
