<p>What does it mean, in general terms, to <em>encode</em> something? Conversely, what does it mean to <em>decode</em> something? Perhaps the most common context for these terms to be used is cryptography (code-making and code-breaking), but they also find application in common digital circuits.</p>
<p>To <em>encode</em> something is to convert an unambiguous piece of information into a form of code that is not so clearly understood. To <em>decode</em> is to perform the reverse operation: translating a code back into an unambiguous form.</p>
<p>This question gets students thinking about encoding and decoding in general terms â€“ terms which they are probably already familiar with. This is a good first step in instruction, to identify a well-known context for a new subject, so students have an easier time relating to it.</p>
