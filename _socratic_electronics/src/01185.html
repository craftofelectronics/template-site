<p>The following circuit is a &quot;multicoupler&quot; for audio signals: one audio signal source (such as a microphone) is distributed to three different outputs:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01185x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Suppose an audio signal is getting through from the input to outputs 2 and 3, but not through to output 1. Identify possible failures in the circuit that could cause this. Be as specific as you can, and identify how you would confirm each type of failure using a multimeter.</p>
<p>Given the existence of multiple answers for this question, I will defer the answer(s) to your instructor, to review during class discussion.</p>
<p>Always be sure to spend plenty of time discussing troubleshooting scenarios with your students, because diagnostic skills are the highest level (and the most valuable) to develop.</p>
<p>Some of your students may be unfamiliar with the symbols used for the input and output jacks. Elaborate on this symbolism, if necessary.</p>
<p>Ask your students to identify the configuration (common-source, common-drain, or common-gate) of each JFET in this circuit, and how these respective configurations relate to the voltage gain (<span class="math"><em>A</em><sub><em>V</em></sub></span>) of each amplification stage.</p>
