<p>One of my &quot;pet peeves&quot; regarding introductory electronics textbooks is that they commonly attempt to explain the workings of PN semiconductor junctions while holding to Rutherford’s obsolete planetary model of the atom. Electrons <em>do not</em> circle atomic nuclei like little planets, free to travel arbitrary orbits. Instead, they may only assume a limited number of energy states, necessitating &quot;quantum leaps&quot; to change between them. It is this discrete behavior that makes semiconductor devices possible. Thankfully, there are a great many plainly-understandable resources on the internet and in some modern textbooks explaining this, and the relationship to current in semiconductor materials.</p>
<p>The very idea of assigning a fixed number for AC voltage or current that (by definition) constantly changes magnitude and direction seems strange. Consequently, there is more than one way to do it. We may assign that value according to the <em>highest</em> magnitude reached in a cycle, in which case we call it the <em>peak</em> measurement. We may mathematically integrate the waveform over time to figure the mean magnitude, in which case we call it the <em>average</em> measurement. Or we may figure out what level of DC (voltage or current) causes the exact same amount of average power to be dissipated by a standard resistive load, in which case we call it the <em>RMS</em> measurement. One common mistake here is to think that the relationship between RMS, average, and peak measurements is a matter of fixed ratios. The number &quot;0.707&quot; is memorized by every beginning electronics student as the ratio between RMS and peak, but what is commonly overlooked is that this particular ratio holds true <em>for perfect sine-waves only!</em> A wave with a different shape will have a different mathematical relationship between peak and RMS values.</p>
<p>Zener diode voltage regulators are often difficult for students to grasp because the diodes themselves are so highly nonlinear. One cannot apply any variation of Ohm’s Law to a zener diode, and this makes the circuit seem intractable at first glance. A &quot;trick&quot; I often apply to the circuits is to first imagine the zener diode failed open and see whether or not the voltage across the (open) diode terminals exceeds the diode’s zener voltage rating. If so, then you know the diode will actually be clipping (limiting) voltage to that rated value, and you may proceed with your circuit analysis assuming that much voltage across any components parallel to the zener diode. If not, you know the diode will not be conducting current, and you may treat it as if it is truly failed open!</p>
<p>No doubt about it, Fourier analysis is a strange concept to understand. Strange, but incredibly useful! While it is relatively easy to grasp the principle that we may create a square-shaped wave (or any other symmetrical waveshape) by mixing together the right combinations of sine waves at different frequencies and amplitudes, it is far from obvious that <em>any</em> periodic waveform may be decomposed into a series of sinusoidal waves the same way. The practical upshot of this is that is it possible to consider very complex waveshapes as being nothing more than a bunch of sine waves added together. Since sine waves are easy to analyze in the context of electric circuits, this means we have a way of simplifying what would otherwise be a dauntingly complex problem: analyzing how circuits respond to non-sinusoidal waveforms.</p>
<p>The actual &quot;nuts and bolts&quot; of Fourier analysis is highly mathematical and well beyond the scope of this course. Right now all I want you to grasp is the concept and significance of equivalence between arbitrary waveshapes and series of sine waves.</p>
<p>A great way to experience this equivalence is to play with a digital oscilloscope with a built-in spectrum analyzer. By introducing different wave-shape signals to the input and switching back and forth between the time-domain (scope) and frequency-domain (spectrum) displays, you may begin to see patterns that will enlighten your understanding.</p>
<p>Students should review the principles of electrical safety prior to building the dual-output AC/DC power supply. Unlike nearly all the previous labs which harbored little or no shock hazard, this project can shock you. The most important rule you can follow is to simply unplug the circuit from the AC line before reaching toward any part of the circuit with your hand or with a conductive tool. The only things you should touch a live circuit with are test probes for measurement equipment! Another common mistake is to fail to remove conductive jewelry (bracelets, rings, etc.) prior to working with line-powered circuits.</p>
