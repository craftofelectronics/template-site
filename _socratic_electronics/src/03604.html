<p>A digital computer network uses a two-conductor cable to send both power (DC) and data (AC pulses) from one computer to another, inductors and capacitors being used to filter the voltages to and from their proper destinations:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03604x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The system works fine for a while, but then one day the receiving computer stops receiving DC power and completely shuts down. Identify the following:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> failed component in the circuit that could possibly account for the problem, and the type of fault (open or short) you suspect that component would have.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Show where you would connect a voltmeter in the circuit to verify a fault in that one suspect component, and the voltage reading (AC, DC, or both) you would expect to get if indeed that one component had failed.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> DC source <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub>2</sub></span> failed (no signal); measure 0 DC voltage directly across its terminals.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Break in cable; measure 0 DC voltage and 0 AC voltage across cable at receiving end.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Inductor <span class="math"><em>L</em><sub>1</sub></span> failed open; measure full DC voltage directly across its terminals.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Inductor <span class="math"><em>L</em><sub>2</sub></span> failed open; measure full DC voltage directly across its terminals.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Inductor <span class="math"><em>L</em><sub>3</sub></span> failed open; measure full DC voltage directly across its terminals.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Inductor <span class="math"><em>L</em><sub>4</sub></span> failed open; measure full DC voltage directly across its terminals.</p>
