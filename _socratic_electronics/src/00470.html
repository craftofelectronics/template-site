<p>Suppose we were building a circuit that required an adjustable resistance with a range of 1500 <span class="math">Ω </span> to 4500 <span class="math">Ω </span>. The only potentiometer we have on hand is a 10 k<span class="math">Ω </span> unit. Of course, we could simply connect the potentiometer as-is and have an adjustable range of 0 <span class="math">Ω </span> to 10,000 <span class="math">Ω </span>, but that would be too &quot;coarse&quot; of an adjustment for our application.</p>
<p>Explain how we could connect other resistors to this 10 k<span class="math">Ω </span> potentiometer in order to achieve the desired adjustable resistance range.</p>
<p>I’ll give you a hint:</p>

<p>Knowing how to limit the adjustable range of a potentiometer is a very useful skill when designing and building circuits where precision of adjustment is important. The only drawback to building such a sub-circuit is that the adjustment becomes nonlinear (i.e., setting the potentiometer to the half-way position does not result in the total resistance being 50% of the way between the lower and upper range values).</p>
