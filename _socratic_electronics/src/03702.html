<p>Predict how all component voltages and currents in this circuit will be affected as a result of the following faults. Consider each fault independently (i.e. one at a time, no multiple faults):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03702x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Diode <span class="math"><em>D</em><sub>1</sub></span> fails open:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Diode <span class="math"><em>D</em><sub>2</sub></span> fails open:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Load resistor fails open:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Transformer <span class="math"><em>T</em><sub>1</sub></span> primary winding fails open:</p>
<p>For each of these conditions, explain <em>why</em> the resulting effects will occur.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Diode <span class="math"><em>D</em><sub>1</sub></span> fails open: <em>Load resistor receives half-wave rectified power instead of full-wave, more voltage across <span class="math"><em>D</em><sub>1</sub></span></em>.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Diode <span class="math"><em>D</em><sub>2</sub></span> fails open: <em>Load resistor receives half-wave rectified power instead of full-wave, more voltage across <span class="math"><em>D</em><sub>2</sub></span></em>.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Load resistor fails open: <em>No current on secondary side of circuit, little current in primary side of circuit, no voltage drop across either <span class="math"><em>D</em><sub>1</sub></span> or <span class="math"><em>D</em><sub>2</sub></span></em>.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Transformer <span class="math"><em>T</em><sub>1</sub></span> primary winding fails open: <em>No current or voltage anywhere on secondary side of circuit, no current in primary side of circuit</em>.</p>
<p>The purpose of this question is to approach the domain of circuit troubleshooting from a perspective of knowing what the fault is, rather than only knowing what the symptoms are. Although this is not necessarily a realistic perspective, it helps students build the foundational knowledge necessary to diagnose a faulted circuit from empirical data. Questions such as this should be followed (eventually) by other questions asking students to identify likely faults based on measurements.</p>
