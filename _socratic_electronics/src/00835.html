<p>Interpret this AC motor control circuit diagram, explaining the meaning of each symbol:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00835x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Also, explain the operation of this motor control circuit. What happens when someone actuates the &quot;Run&quot; switch? What happens when they let go of the &quot;Run&quot; switch?</p>
<p>In this circuit, the motor will start once the &quot;Run&quot; switch is actuated. When the &quot;Run&quot; switch is released, the motor continues to run.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: this circuit has no &quot;stop&quot; switch! What would have to be modified in the ladder logic circuit to provide &quot;stop&quot; control?</p>
<p>This circuit is known as a <em>latching</em> circuit, because it &quot;latches&quot; in the &quot;on&quot; state after a momentary action. The contact in parallel with the &quot;Run&quot; switch is often referred to as a <em>seal-in contact</em>, because it &quot;seals&quot; the momentary condition of the Run switch closure after that switch is de-actuated.</p>
<p>The follow-up question of how we may make the motor stop running is a very important one. Spend time with your students discussing this practical design problem, and implement a solution.</p>
