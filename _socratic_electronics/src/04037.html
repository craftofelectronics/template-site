<p>Calculate the output voltage rate-of-change (<span class="math">$dv \over dt$</span>) for this active integrator circuit, being sure to explain all the steps involved in determining the answer:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{04037x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math">$dv \over dt$</span> = +74.47 volts/second</p>
<p>Ask your students to relate the capacitive &quot;Ohmâ€™s Law&quot; equation to their solutions:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$i = C {dv \over dt}$</span><br /></p>
