<p>You may use circuit simulation software to set up similar oscilloscope display interpretation scenarios, for practice or for verification of what you see in this exercise.</p>
<p>Use a sine-wave function generator for the AC voltage source, and be sure set the frequency to some reasonable value (well within the capability of both the oscilloscope and counter to measure).</p>
<p>If this is not the first time students have done this, be sure to &quot;mess up&quot; the oscilloscope controls prior to them making adjustments. Students <em>must</em> learn how to quickly configure an oscilloscopeâ€™s controls to display any arbitrary waveform, if they are to be proficient in using an oscilloscope as a diagnostic tool.</p>
