<p>Use circuit simulation software to verify your predicted and measured parameter values.</p>
<p>Use a variable-voltage, regulated power supply to supply any amount of DC voltage below 30 volts. Specify standard resistor values, all between 1 k<span class="math">Ω </span> and 100 k<span class="math">Ω </span> (1k5, 2k2, 2k7, 3k3, 4k7, 5k1, 6k8, 8k2, 10k, 22k, 33k, 39k 47k, 68k, 82k, etc.).</p>
<p>I have used this circuit as both a &quot;quick&quot; lab exercise and a troubleshooting exercise, using values of 10 k<span class="math">Ω </span> for R1, R2, and R3; 15 k<span class="math">Ω </span> for R(load1); 22 k<span class="math">Ω </span> for R(load2); and 6 volts for the power supply. Of course, these component values are not critical, but they do provide easy-to measure voltages and currents without incurring excessive impedances that would cause significant voltmeter loading problems.</p>
<p>An extension of this exercise is to incorporate troubleshooting questions. Whether using this exercise as a performance assessment or simply as a concept-building lab, you might want to follow up your students’ results by asking them to predict the consequences of certain circuit faults.</p>
