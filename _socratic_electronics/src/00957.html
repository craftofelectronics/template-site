<p>Describe the functions of resistors R1 and R2, and capacitor C1, in this amplifier circuit. What purpose do they serve?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00957x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Would it be possible for this amplifier circuit to operate in Class A mode without this voltage divider/capacitor network? Explain your answer.</p>
<p>Resistors R1 and R2 produce a DC biasing voltage, and capacitor C1 &quot;couples&quot; the AC input signal to the biasing network, preventing any DC bias from the signal source to influence the amplifierâ€™s Q point.</p>
<p>While other biasing networks are possible for a Class A amplifier circuit, some type of DC bias voltage is necessary to make a bipolar junction transistor operate in Class A mode.</p>
<p>Discuss with your students the meaning of &quot;Class A&quot; amplification, and why DC biasing is necessary in order to achieve this mode of operation in a BJT circuit.</p>
