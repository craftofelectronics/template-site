<p>Complete the schematic diagram showing how two 12-volt batteries would be connected together to form a &quot;split&quot; (+12/-12) power supply for this comparator circuit, and then trace the complete path of current when the LED is energized. Ignore the comparatorâ€™s input terminals in this circuit. Just assume they are connected to sources of voltage appropriate for turning the LED on:</p>
