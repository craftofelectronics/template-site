<p>Predict how all component voltages and currents in this circuit will be affected as a result of the following faults. Consider each fault independently (i.e. one at a time, no multiple faults):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03707x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Transformer <span class="math"><em>T</em><sub>1</sub></span> primary winding fails open:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Transformer <span class="math"><em>T</em><sub>1</sub></span> primary winding fails shorted:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Transformer <span class="math"><em>T</em><sub>1</sub></span> secondary winding fails open:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Load fails shorted:</p>
<p>For each of these conditions, explain <em>why</em> the resulting effects will occur.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Transformer <span class="math"><em>T</em><sub>1</sub></span> primary winding fails open: <em>No current through any component, no voltage across any secondary-side component.</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Transformer <span class="math"><em>T</em><sub>1</sub></span> primary winding fails shorted: <em>Large current through fuse (which will cause it to blow), little current through secondary winding or load, little voltage across secondary winding or load.</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Transformer <span class="math"><em>T</em><sub>1</sub></span> secondary winding fails open: <em>No current through any secondary-side component, no voltage across any secondary-winding component, little current through primary winding.</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Load fails shorted: <em>Large current through fuse (which will cause it to blow), large current through secondary winding and load, little voltage across secondary winding or load.</em></p>
<p>The purpose of this question is to approach the domain of circuit troubleshooting from a perspective of knowing what the fault is, rather than only knowing what the symptoms are. Although this is not necessarily a realistic perspective, it helps students build the foundational knowledge necessary to diagnose a faulted circuit from empirical data. Questions such as this should be followed (eventually) by other questions asking students to identify likely faults based on measurements.</p>
