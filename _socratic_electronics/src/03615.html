<p>Although it may not look like it, a two-wire (&quot;dipole&quot;) radio antenna is actually a resonant circuit in and of itself. Optimum transmitting performance is reached when the transmission frequency is equal to the natural resonant frequency of the antenna:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03615x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>First, explain how two pieces of wire are able to <em>resonate</em>, given the fact that resonance requires the existence of both inductance and capacitance, and that there are neither inductors nor capacitors attached to the wires. Then, describe what would have to be altered about this antenna to &quot;tune&quot; it for resonance at a higher transmission frequency.</p>
<p>The necessary inductance and capacitance are parasitic in nature: inductance existing simply from the wiresâ€™ length and capacitance existing in open space between the wires. This antenna must be made <em>shorter</em> to resonate at a higher frequency.</p>
