<p>Components soldered into printed circuit boards often possess &quot;stray&quot; inductance, also known as <em>parasitic</em> inductance. Observe this resistor, soldered in to a circuit board:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00374x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Where does the parasitic inductance come from? What is it about a resistor, mounted to a circuit board, that creates a (very) small amount of inductance? How is it possible to minimize this inductance, in case it is detrimental to the circuitâ€™s operation?</p>
<p>Inductance naturally exists along any conductor. The longer the conductor, the more inductance, all other factors being equal.</p>
<p>In high-frequency AC circuits, such as computer circuits where pulses of voltage oscillate at millions of cycles per second, even short lengths of wire or traces on a circuit board may present substantial trouble by virtue of their stray inductance. Some of this parasitic inductance may be reduced by proper circuit board assembly, some of it by a re-design of component layout on the circuit board.</p>
<p>According to an article in magazine (&quot;<em>Putting Passives In Their Place</em>&quot;, July 2003, Volume 40, Number 7, page 29), the transient currents created by fast-switching logic circuits can be as high as 500 amps/ns, which is a <span class="math">$di \over dt$</span> rate of 500 <em>billion</em> amps per second!! At these levels, even a few picohenrys of parasitic inductance along component leads and circuit board traces will result in significant voltage drops.</p>
