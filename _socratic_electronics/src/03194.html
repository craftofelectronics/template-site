<p>Which direction would you have to move the wiper on potentiometer <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>p</em><em>o</em><em>t</em>2</sub></span> to <em>increase</em> the duty cycle of the output waveform? Explain your answer.</p>
<p>Moving the wiper <em>up</em> (as drawn in the schematic) produces greater duty cycles.</p>
<p>Notice that I did not even hint at <em>why</em> this is. Ask your students to fully explain their answers!</p>
