<p>Sum-of-Product Boolean expressions all follow the same general form. As such, their equivalent logic gate circuits likewise follow a common form. Translate each of these SOP expressions into its equivalent logic gate circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$AB + A\overline{B}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$A\overline{B} + \overline{A}B$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$ABC + \overline{A}B\overline{C} + AB\overline{C}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01325x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01325x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01325x03.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The translation from Boolean SOP to gate circuit should not be difficult. The point of this question is to get students thinking in terms of sum-of-products form, so they will be ready for the next step: linking this concept with truth tables.</p>
