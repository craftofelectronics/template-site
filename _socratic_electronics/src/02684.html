<p>Examine this progression of mathematical statements:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">${1000 \over 100} = 10$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">${1000 \over 100} = 10^1$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\log \left( {1000 \over 100} \right) = \log 10^1$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">log1000 − log100 = log10<sup>1</sup></span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">log10<sup>3</sup> − log10<sup>2</sup> = log10<sup>1</sup></span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">3 − 2 = 1</span><br /></p>
<p>What began as a division problem ended up as a subtraction problem, through the application of logarithms. What does this tell you about the utility of logarithms as an arithmetic tool?</p>
<p>That logarithms can reduce the complexity of an equation from division, down to subtraction, indicates its usefulness as a tool to <em>simplify</em> arithmetic problems. Specifically, the logarithm of a quotient is equal to the difference between the logarithms of the two numbers being divided.</p>
<p>In mathematics, any procedure that reduces a complex type of problem into a simpler type of problem is called a <em>transform function</em>, and logarithms are one of the simplest types of transform functions in existence.</p>
