<p>E-type MOSFETs are <em>normally-off</em> devices just like bipolar junction transistors, the natural state of their channels strongly resisting the passage of electric currents. Thus, a state of conduction will only occur on command from an external source.</p>
<p>Explain what must be done to an E-type MOSFET, specifically, to drive it into a state of conduction (where a channel forms to conduct current between source and drain).</p>
<p>A voltage must be applied between gate and substrate (or gate and source if the substrate is connected to the source terminal) in such a way that the polarity of the gate terminal electrostatically attracts the channelâ€™s majority charge carriers (forming an inversion layer directly underneath the insulating layer separating gate from channel).</p>
<p>This is perhaps the most important question your students could learn to answer when first studying E-type MOSFETs. What, exactly, is necessary to turn one on? Have your students draw diagrams to illustrate their answers as they present in front of the class.</p>
<p>Ask them specifically to identify what polarity of <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>G</em><em>S</em></sub></span> would have to be applied to turn on an N-channel E-type MOSFET, and also a P-channel E-type MOSFET.</p>
