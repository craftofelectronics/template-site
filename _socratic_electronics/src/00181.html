<p>What units of measurement are used to express quantities of <em>voltage</em>, <em>current</em>, and <em>resistance</em>?</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Voltage is measured in the unit of the <em>volt</em> (V).</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Current is measured in the unit of the <em>ampere</em>, or <em>amp</em> (A).</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Resistance is measured in the unit of the <em>ohm</em> (<span class="math">Ω </span>).</p>
<p>Like all other physical quantities, there are units of measurement appropriate for specifying electrical quantities. In this sense, the &quot;volt,&quot; &quot;amp,&quot; or &quot;ohm&quot; are no different from &quot;gram,&quot; &quot;yard,&quot; or &quot;bushel.&quot;</p>
