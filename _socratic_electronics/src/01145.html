<p>&quot;FM&quot; means &quot;frequency modulation,&quot; and it refers to the encoding of a waveform by changing (modulating) the frequency of another. This is the technology used in broadcast FM radio transmission:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01145x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>This is how FM radio communication works: by modulating the frequency of a radio-frequency (RF) signal according to the amplitude of the voltage signal produced by a microphone.</p>
<p>Explain how a phase-locked loop circuit could be used to <em>&quot;demodulate&quot;</em> the output of an FM radio station, so as to extract the broadcasterâ€™s audio signal from the RF waveform.</p>
<p>This diagram, of course, shows a much-simplified system for FM demodulation:</p>

<p>Despite the crudeness of the answer given, the basic operational theory of a PLL demodulator should be apparent for students to see. Discuss the operation of this circuit with your students, making sure all of them comprehend the purpose of a PLL.</p>
