<p>When AC induction motors are powered by variable-frequency drives (VFDs), frequency to the motor is not the only parameter varied. VFDs are also equipped with the ability to vary voltage along with frequency, and with good reason. If a VFD were used to decrease the frequency to an AC induction motor to make it spin slower, and it were to hold the RMS voltage constant to that motor, the motor would likely overheat.</p>
<p>Explain <em>in electrical terms</em> why an AC motor tends to overheat given a decreased line frequency and a constant line voltage. Be sure to show some sort of equation in your answer giving a mathematical basis for the overheating.</p>
<p>Since the motor’s inductive reactance varies directly with frequency (<span class="math"><em>X</em><sub><em>L</em></sub> = 2<em>π</em><em>f</em><em>L</em></span>), voltage must also vary directly with frequency to maintain a constant AC current to the motor windings (<span class="math">$I = {V \over X}$</span>). If the <span class="math">$V \over f$</span> ratio is not stable, current will increase as frequency decreases, possibly overheating the motor at low speeds.</p>
<p>Assuming that reactance (<span class="math"><em>X</em></span>) is the dominant form of impedance in the motor circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$X_L = 2 \pi f L \hbox{\hskip 10pt therefore, \hskip 10pt} X_L \propto f$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$I = {V \over X} \hbox{\hskip 10pt therefore, \hskip 10pt} I \propto {V \over f}$</span><br /></p>
