<p>The simplest type of digital logic circuit is an <em>inverter</em>, also called an <em>inverting buffer</em>, or <em>NOT gate</em>. Here is a schematic diagram for an inverter gate constructed from bipolar transistors (transistor-to-transistor-logic, also known as <em>TTL</em>), shown connected to a SPDT switch and an LED:</p>

<p>The left-most transistor in this schematic is actually not being used as a transistor, but rather it functions as a &quot;steering diode&quot; network, like this:</p>

<p>Determine the status of the LED in each of the input switchâ€™s two positions. Denote the logic level of switch and LED in the form of a truth table:</p>

<p>Have your students explain the operation of this TTL circuit, describing how the inverse logic state is generated at the output terminal, from a given input state.</p>
