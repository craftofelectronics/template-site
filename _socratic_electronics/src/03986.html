<p>Explain what an <em>active probe</em> is for an oscilloscope, and why they are useful for some measurement applications.</p>
<p>Active oscilloscope probes contain electronic amplifiers within them, the purpose of which I leave you to research!</p>
<p>Follow-up question: can you think of any disadvantages of active probes? In other words, reasons why an old-fashioned passive probe would be a better choice than an active probe for signal measurement?</p>
<p>One place your students might wish to research in answering this question is a technical specifications page for different oscilloscope probes. By comparing the specs of active versus passive probes, the advantages (and disadvantages) should become evident.</p>
