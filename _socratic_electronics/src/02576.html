<p>Singers who wish to practice singing to popular music find that the following <em>vocal eliminator</em> circuit is useful:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02576x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The circuit works on the principle that vocal tracks are usually recorded through a single microphone at the recording studio, and thus are represented equally on each channel of a stereo sound system. This circuit effectively eliminates the vocal track from the song, leaving only the music to be heard through the headphone or speaker.</p>
<p>Operational amplifiers <span class="math"><em>U</em><sub>1</sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>U</em><sub>2</sub></span> provide input buffering so that the other opamp circuits do not excessively load the left and right channel input signals. Opamp <span class="math"><em>U</em><sub>3</sub></span> performs the subtraction function necessary to eliminate the vocal track.</p>
<p>You might think that these three opamps would be sufficient to make a vocal eliminator circuit, but there is one more necessary feature. Not only is the vocal track common to both left and right channels, but so is most of the bass (low-frequency) tones. Thus, the first three opamps (<span class="math"><em>U</em><sub>1</sub></span>, <span class="math"><em>U</em><sub>2</sub></span>, and <span class="math"><em>U</em><sub>3</sub></span>) eliminate both vocal <em>and</em> bass signals from getting to the output, which is not what we want.</p>
<p>Explain how the other three opamps (<span class="math"><em>U</em><sub>4</sub></span>, <span class="math"><em>U</em><sub>5</sub></span>, and <span class="math"><em>U</em><sub>6</sub></span>) work to restore bass tones to the output so they are not lost along with the vocal track.</p>
<p>Iâ€™ll let you figure out the function of opamps <span class="math"><em>U</em><sub>4</sub></span>, <span class="math"><em>U</em><sub>5</sub></span>, and <span class="math"><em>U</em><sub>6</sub></span> on your own!</p>
<p>Not only does this circuit illustrate a neat application of opamps, but it also showcases modular operational circuit design, where each opamp (and its supporting passive components) performs exactly one task.</p>
