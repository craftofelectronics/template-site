<p>One of the more complicated controls to master on an oscilloscope, but also one of the most useful, is the <em>triggering</em> control. Without proper &quot;triggering,&quot; a waveform will scroll horizontally across the screen rather than staying &quot;locked&quot; in place.</p>
<p>Describe how the triggering control is able to &quot;lock&quot; an AC waveform on the screen so that it appears stable to the human eye. What, exactly, is the triggering function doing that makes an AC waveform appear to stand still?</p>
<p>The triggering circuit inside the oscilloscope delays the initiation of a beam &quot;sweep&quot; across the screen until the instantaneous voltage value of the waveform has reached the same point, every time, on the wave-shape.</p>
<p>For students who have every used a &quot;strobe&quot; or &quot;timing&quot; light to make a rotating object appear to &quot;freeze&quot; in place, the concept of oscilloscope triggering makes perfect sense. In fact, a strobe light and a rotating object such as a fan work very well to illustrate the concept of having to &quot;flash&quot; at just the right times in order to make something moving appear to be still.</p>
<p>An interesting comparison to make is between a strobe light (freezing the motion of a fan) set to a frequency that is slightly &quot;off&quot; sync – thereby causing the rotating object to appear to move <em>very slowly</em> – and an oscilloscope with the triggering turned off, and the horizontal sweep speed set in the same manner, adjusted to make the AC waveform horizontally scroll across the screen.</p>
<p>Once your students have seen this comparison, ask them to describe what would be necessary to &quot;trigger&quot; a strobe light so that the moving object always appears to stand still, and cannot &quot;scroll&quot; due to a mismatch in frequencies.</p>
