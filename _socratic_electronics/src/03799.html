<p>Identify at least two different component faults that would result in a change in duty cycle for this oscillator circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03799x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>A short in either of the two diodes would cause the duty cycle to change.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: what would happen if either of these two diodes failed open?</p>
<p>Ask your students to explain why the duty cycle would change as a result of either diode failing shorted. This is a good opportunity to further explore the operation of this oscillator circuit.</p>
