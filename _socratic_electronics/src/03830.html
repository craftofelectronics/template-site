<p>Identify at least two faults in this simple logic gate circuit that could cause its output to fail in the &quot;low&quot; logic state:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03830x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Be sure to explain <em>why</em> the proposed faults would cause the output to fail low.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Transistor <span class="math"><em>Q</em><sub>1</sub></span> failed shorted (collector to emitter)</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Transistor <span class="math"><em>Q</em><sub>2</sub></span> failed shorted (collector to emitter)</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Input line A shorted to ground</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Input line B shorted to ground</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Resistor <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>p</em><em>u</em><em>l</em><em>l</em><em>u</em><em>p</em></sub></span> failed open</p>
<p>Follow-up question: though all of these faults <em>would</em> cause the output to go low, not all of them would cause the output to go low in the same way. Explain this.</p>
<p>Discuss your students’ answers with everyone in class, and their reasoning behind them.</p>
