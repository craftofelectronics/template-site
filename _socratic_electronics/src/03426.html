<p>The following bridge circuit uses two strain gauges (one to measure strain, the other to compensate for temperature changes), the amount of strain indicated by the voltmeter in the center of the bridge. Unfortunately, though, it has a problem. Instead of registering a very small voltage as it normally does, the voltmeter shows a large voltage difference, with point <strong>B</strong> positive and point <strong>A</strong> negative:</p>

<p>Something is wrong in the bridge circuit, because this voltage is present even when there is no physical stress on the specimen. Based on this data, identify two things:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> components or wires in the circuit that you know must be in good working condition.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> components or wires in the circuit that could possibly be bad (either one independently capable of causing the large voltage across the voltmeter), and the type of failure for each possibility (open or shorted).</p>
