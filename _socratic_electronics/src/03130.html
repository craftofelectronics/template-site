<p>Suppose a DC generator is powering an electric motor, which we model as a 100 <span class="math">Ω </span> resistor:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03130x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Calculate the amount of current this generator will supply to the motor and the voltage measured across the motor’s terminals, taking into account all the resistances shown (generator internal resistance <span class="math"><em>r</em><sub><em>g</em><em>e</em><em>n</em></sub></span>, wiring resistances <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>w</em><em>i</em><em>r</em><em>e</em></sub></span>, and the motor’s equivalent resistance).</p>
<p>Now suppose we connect an identical generator in parallel with the first, using connecting wire so short that we may safely discount its additional resistance:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03130x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Use the Superposition Theorem to re-calculate the motor current and motor terminal voltage, commenting on how these figures compare with the first calculation (using only one generator).</p>
<p>With only one generator connected:</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>I</em><sub><em>m</em><em>o</em><em>t</em><em>o</em><em>r</em></sub></span> = 4.726 amps <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>m</em><em>o</em><em>t</em><em>o</em><em>r</em></sub></span> = 472.6 volts</p>
<p>With two generators connected:</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>I</em><sub><em>m</em><em>o</em><em>t</em><em>o</em><em>r</em></sub></span> = 4.733 amps <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>m</em><em>o</em><em>t</em><em>o</em><em>r</em></sub></span> = 473.3 volts</p>
<p>Challenge question: how much current does <em>each</em> generator supply to the circuit when there are two generators connected in parallel?</p>
<p>Some students will erroneously leap to the conclusion that another generator will send twice the current through the load (with twice the voltage drop across the motor terminals!). Such a conclusion is easy to reach if one does not fully understand the Superposition Theorem.</p>
