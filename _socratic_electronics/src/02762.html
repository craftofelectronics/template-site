<p>Crude logic gates circuits may be constructed out of nothing but diodes and resistors. Take for example this logic gate circuit:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02762x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Identify what type of logic function is represented by this gate circuit (AND, OR, inverter, etc.). Also, trace the directions of all currents in this circuit.</p>
<p>This is an AND gate circuit.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02762x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Follow-up question: show how the two SPDT switches could be replaced by SPST switches (without the need for pullup or pulldown resistors).</p>
<p>Challenge question: explain why it may be impractical to design this diode-resistor gate circuit to directly drive an LED so that it lights up when the output state is &quot;high.&quot;</p>
<p>Diode-resistor gate circuits such as this are rarely used in real digital circuitry because they have no capacity to <em>amplify</em> weak input signals. They also have no capacity for signal inversion, rendering them incapable of representing a great many logic function types. Gates made from transistors are much preferred over diode-resistor technology.</p>
