<p>Complete the timing diagram for this universal shift register, given the input conditions shown. Assume that the parallel load (<span class="math">$\overline{PL}$</span>) input is synchronous, that the shifting direction is from left-to-right (from <span class="math"><em>Q</em><sub>0</sub></span> to <span class="math"><em>Q</em><sub>3</sub></span>), and that all <span class="math"><em>Q</em></span> outputs begin in the low state:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03083x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03083x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Note to instructor: <em>I recommend assigning one-quarter point per output line per clock pulse. Four output lines and eight clock pulses make for 32 points at which you may check for output states being correct.</em></p>
