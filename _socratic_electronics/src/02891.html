<p>One way to think of the basic logic gate types (all but the XOR and XNOR gates) is to consider what single input state guarantees a certain output state. For example, we could describe the function of an OR gate as such:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\hbox{\it Any high input guarantees a high output.}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Identify what type of gate is represented by each of the following phrases:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Any high input guarantees a low output.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Any low input guarantees a high output.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Any low input guarantees a low output.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Any high input guarantees a low output: <strong>NOR</strong> gate.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Any low input guarantees a high output: <strong>NAND</strong> gate.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Any low input guarantees a low output: <strong>AND</strong> gate.</p>
<p>This is a very useful way to think of the different logic gate types, as often you are faced with a choice of which gate type to use for a specific function in a digital circuit based on a requirement cast in these terms (&quot;Any <em>blank</em> input guarantees a <em>blank</em> output&quot;).</p>
<p>For example, we might need a gate to perform a &quot;disable&quot; function for a digital signal:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{02891x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Considered in terms of what input state forces a low output, the choice to use an AND gate becomes obvious.</p>
