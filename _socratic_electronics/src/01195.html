<p>The numeration system we use in our daily lives is called <em>base ten</em>, also called <em>decimal</em> or <em>denary</em>. What, exactly, does &quot;base ten&quot; mean?</p>
<p>Given the following base-ten number, identify which digits occupy the &quot;one’s place,&quot; &quot;ten’s place,&quot; &quot;hundred’s place,&quot; and &quot;thousand’s place,&quot; respectively:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">5, 183</span><br /></p>
<p>&quot;Base ten&quot; means that numbers are represented by combinations of symbols (ciphers), of which there are only ten (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9).</p>
<p>Analyzing the number 5,183:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> One’s place: <strong>3</strong></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Ten’s place: <strong>8</strong></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Hundred’s place: <strong>1</strong></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Thousand’s place: <strong>5</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;base&quot; of our numeration system is something people usually don’t think much about – it is simply taken for granted. The purpose of this question is to help students realize what numerical symbols actually mean, in preparation for understanding other systems of numeration.</p>
