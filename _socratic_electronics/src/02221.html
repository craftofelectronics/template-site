<p>Describe what the output voltage of this transistor circuit will do (measured with reference to ground), if the input voltage ramps from 0 volts to -10 volts (measured with respect to ground):</p>

<p>Trick question! <span class="math"><em>V</em><sub><em>o</em><em>u</em><em>t</em></sub></span> will remain at 0 volts the entire time.</p>
<p>This might not be the result many students expect! It is important, though, for them to understand the importance of polarity in transistor circuits. This example should make that abundantly clear.</p>
