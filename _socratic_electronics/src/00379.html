<p>Calculate the total inductance in this collection of inductors, as measured between the two wires:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{00379x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Also, write a formula that calculates total inductance given the values of inductors <span class="math"><em>L</em><sub>1</sub></span>, <span class="math"><em>L</em><sub>2</sub></span>, and <span class="math"><em>L</em><sub>3</sub></span>.</p>
<p><span class="math"><em>L</em><sub><em>t</em><em>o</em><em>t</em><em>a</em><em>l</em></sub></span> = 783.26 mH</p>
<p>Note: the following formula is not the only possible one for describing total inductance in this circuit!</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$L_{total} = L_1 + {{L_2 L_3} \over {L_2 + L_3}}$</span><br /></p>
<p>It is most helpful to first draw a schematic diagram for this inductor network before trying to perform any inductance calculations, in order that a clear understanding of the series/parallel connections be established.</p>
