<p>A <em>thermistor</em> is a special resistor that dramatically changes resistance with changes in temperature. Consider the circuit shown below, with two identical thermistors:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01751x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The &quot;+t<span class="math">$^{o}$</span>&quot; label in each one shows that they both have positive <span class="math"><em>Î±</em></span> coefficients.</p>
<p>How much voltage would you expect the voltmeter to register when the two thermistors are at the exact same temperature? Which thermistor would have to become hotter in order to cause the voltmeter to read a significant <em>negative</em> voltage?</p>
<p>If the two thermistors are at equal temperature, the voltmeter should register 0 volts. To get the voltmeter to register negative, the left-hand thermistor would have to be warmer than the right-hand thermistor.</p>
<p>This circuit may be viewed from the perspective of it being two voltage dividers, or from the perspective of being a current divider. Either way, it is a good exercise for you and your students to explore how it functions.</p>
