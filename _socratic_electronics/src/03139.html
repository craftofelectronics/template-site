<p>A simple time-delay relay may be constructed by connecting a large capacitor in parallel with the relay coil, like this:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03139x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>Explain how this circuit works, and also determine what type of time-delay relay function is provided by it (NOTO, NOTC, NCTO, or NCTC).</p>
<p>Normally-open, timed-open (NOTO).</p>
<p>Follow-up question: what purpose does the diode serve in this circuit?</p>
<p>For substantial time delays (many seconds) on large relays (high-current coils), the capacitor must be <em>huge</em>, making this a somewhat impractical circuit for all but miniature relays.</p>
