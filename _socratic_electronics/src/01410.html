<p>Design a circuit to convert four-bit binary to four-bit Gray code. Hint: it uses Exclusive-OR gates.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01410x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>This circuit is very easy to design, if you remember the conversion process going from binary to Gray. There are many good references available for students to learn (or re-learn) this process from, so donâ€™t simply tell them how to do it! Let them research it on their own.</p>
