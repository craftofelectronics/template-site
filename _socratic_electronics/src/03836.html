<p>Predict how the operation of this relay logic circuit will be affected as a result of the following faults. Consider each fault independently (i.e. one at a time, no multiple faults):</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{03836x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Pushbutton switch A fails open:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Relay coil CR2 fails open:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Relay contact CR1-1 fails open:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Relay contact CR2-1 fails shorted:</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Relay contact CR2-2 fails shorted:</p>
<p>For each of these conditions, explain <em>why</em> the resulting effects will occur.</p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Pushbutton switch A fails open: <em>Lamp 1 always energized, lamp 2 simply becomes inverse status of pushbutton switch B.</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Relay coil CR2 fails open: <em>Both lamp 1 and lamp 2 simply become inverse status of pushbutton switch A.</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Relay contact CR1-1 fails open: <em>Lamp 1 simply becomes same status as pushbutton switch B.</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Relay contact CR2-1 fails shorted: <em>Lamp 1 always energized.</em></p>
<p><span class="math"> • </span> Relay contact CR2-2 fails shorted: <em>Lamp 2 simply becomes inverse status of pushbutton switch A.</em></p>
<p>The purpose of this question is to approach the domain of circuit troubleshooting from a perspective of knowing what the fault is, rather than only knowing what the symptoms are. Although this is not necessarily a realistic perspective, it helps students build the foundational knowledge necessary to diagnose a faulted circuit from empirical data. Questions such as this should be followed (eventually) by other questions asking students to identify likely faults based on measurements.</p>
