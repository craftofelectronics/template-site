<p>A capacitor has a label on it saying, &quot;100 WVDC&quot;. What does this label mean? What is the consequence of exceeding this rating?</p>
<p>The capacitorâ€™s <em>working voltage</em> is 100 volts DC. Failure of the dielectric material will result from exceeding this voltage rating. In electrolytic capacitors especially, the failure can be violent!</p>
<p>As with resistors and resistance ratings, there is more to the rating of a capacitor than merely capacitance! Discuss with your students the importance of safety when working with capacitors, not only from shock hazard but also from explosions (resulting from excessive voltage).</p>
