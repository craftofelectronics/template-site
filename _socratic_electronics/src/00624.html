<p>Describe the so-called &quot;domain theory&quot; of magnetism, as it applies to permanent magnets.</p>
<p>Iâ€™ll let you research the answer to this question!</p>
<p>First, ask your students what a &quot;permanent&quot; magnet is. Are there other kinds of magnets? If so, what might they be called?</p>
<p>One of the more interesting applications of domain theory is <em>bubble memory</em>, a type of computer memory technology making use of localized &quot;bubbles&quot; of magnetism in a material corresponding to discrete magnetic domains. You might want to bring this up in discussion, if none of your students do it first.</p>
