<p>Calculate all voltage drops in this circuit, expressing your answers in complex (polar) form:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01071x01.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>The load resistor’s color code is as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Brown, Black, Black, Brown, Violet</strong></p>
<p>Assume the resistor’s error is 0%. That is, its resistance value is precisely equal to what the &quot;digit&quot; and &quot;multiplier&quot; color bands declare. The signal generator’s output is 25 volts RMS, at a frequency of 2 kHz.</p>
<p>Challenge question: what practical function does this circuit perform?</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$\epsfbox{01071x02.eps}$</span><br /></p>
<p>This circuit is a high-pass filter.</p>
<p>The real &quot;answer&quot; to this question is the circuit analysis technique employed. Ask your students, perhaps working teams, to explain how to arrive at the different voltage drop figures. Note any similarities in analysis technique to that of DC circuit analysis.</p>
