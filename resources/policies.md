These policies have grown out of previous offerings of this course, and we will grow and modify them as we work together throughout the term.

## Office Hours

I am more than happy to chat, and sometimes you can stop by during office hours and I'll be free; however, I schedule my time pretty tightly, so it is possible I may ask you to make an appointment and/or follow up via email.

## Course Prerequisites

MATH 012.

## Attendance

We do a great deal of work collaboratively in class, and learn a great deal from working with each-other. After **two unexcused absence**, I reserve the right to deduct 5% per absence from your final grade. 

### Reasons You Might Be Absent

* If you have flu-like symptoms, email me and visit the health center. The Center for Disease Control recommends you stay home for at least 24 hours after the symptoms pass---RESTING. Without evidence from the health center of your visit, you are not excused.

* If you arrive particularly late, leave particularly early, or fail to participate in class, I will consider you absent.

If you miss class, you are responsible for getting caught up.

## Technology Policies 

Much of the work in this course will require use of the computer, so these policies are designed to help you better understand how to be effective in a technology-rich environment. 

* **Laptop and Software**: We will regularly make use of laptops during class, and you are expected to have them unless explicitly stated otherwise.

* **Communication**: The course website is your primary source for information about this course. Messages about the course will often be sent by email. These are all mechanisms you would likely use in a professional position in the real world (corporate websites, internal content management systems, and email)---you are, likewise, expected to use them in a responsible and professional manner in this course.

* **Backups**: All students are expected to back-up their work on a daily basis, which includes laboratories, assignments, and quizzes. The best way to do this is to store a copy of all work in a cloud service such as Dropbox, SkyDrive, Google Drive, or to use a DVD, flash drive, or some other media. Storing multiple copies of something on your laptop is not a backup. I will not be sympathetic to lost work in any way, shape, or form.

## Evening Lab / Support

The Computing and Digital Crafts Lab is open Sunday through Thursday from 7:00 to 9:00 PM (except on evenings of convocations). The primary teaching assistant and several other TAs will be able to answer questions about the content in the course during consultations in their  Lab hours. You are strongly encouraged to make use of the help available in the Computing and Digital Crafts Lab, as well as in the instructors' office hours. Best results are obtained trying to solve problems before asking for help, and you should be prepared to show what you have already tried. Topics in this course build throughout the course, so you should be sure to do your best to keep up with the class, so as to not fall behind. No question to which you do not know the answer is "dumb" unless it goes unanswered because it remained unasked.
