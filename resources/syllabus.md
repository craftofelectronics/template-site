## Course Goals 
If this was the *only* course in electricity and electronics you take at Berea College, and you never touch or study the subject again while you are a student, what questions do I hope you will be able to answer 10 years from now?

1. **How can I be safe in everything I do?** <br/>

1. **How do I communicate, with clarity, the results of my efforts?** <br/>

1. **How can I design electrical systems to sense and interact with the world?** <br/>

1. **How do I build and program those systems?** <br/>

Learning objectives involve the kinds of knowledge you will gain regarding electricity and electronics, the ability to apply and integrate it, as well as the human connections and opportunities for lifelong learning in the field. As the course progresses, we will work together to develop answers to the following questions.
{% endcomment %}

Our learning objectives define the ways we will measure our success throughout the course. These are the kinds of questions we will be measuring ourselves against as we engage with new learning day-to-day.

* **MAKER**: How do I use the tools of the global electronics maker community to create, communicate, and collaborate on electrical systems?

* **DESIGN**: What knowledge of electronic components (and how they come together) do I need to design circuits to sense and automate the world around me?

* **LANGUAGE**: How do I interpret and create the many textual and visual representations of electronic circuits, and use that information to build circuits that work?

* **CODE**: How can I prepare myself to program systems that sense and automate the world around me, even if I've never programmed a computer before?

* **CONNECTIONS**: What are the connections between the theories of electricity and electronics to our daily lives?

* **QUESTION**: What questions can I ask about myself and the world around me, now and in the future, that sensing and automation systems can help me answer?

{% comment %}
1. **REVERSE SCAFFOLDING**: Should there be something about the research process here, so that we can clearly talk about the R&D process as it pertains to technology. (Actually, this could be viewed as being intentionally woven into the **QUESTION** learning objective.)

## Measuring Success

Throughout the term, you will receive two kinds of feedback:

* **Points for Improvement**. As we go through the semester, the majority of the feedback you receive will be structured to help you grow as a student of electricity and electronics. **Everything we do will provide feedback for improvement of some sort**.

* **Points of Measurement**. Some assignments (or exams) will be about measuring your growth as well as providing further feedback.

### Points of Measurement

All of your work will be assessed, and receive feedback. We will use seven assignments throughout the term to measure your learning. The work you do leading up to these assignments will prepare you to do well on them, if you engage fully and respond constructively to the feedback you are given.

There will be four exam-like assessments throughout the term:

{% pad 5 %}

{% assessment <b>#</b> | <b>Week</b>  |  <b>Percent</b> | <b>Activity</b> %}
{% assessment 1 | Week 3  |  5% | Voltage, Current, and Resistance: Round 1 %}
{% assessment 2 | Week 5  | 10% | The 24-hour Takehome %}
{% assessment 3 | Week 7  | 10% | Voltage, Current, and Resistance:, Round 2 %}
{% assessment 4 | Week 10 | 10% | Components Exam %}

{% pad 10 %}

There will be two major reports:

{% pad 5 %}

{% assessment <b>#</b> | <b>Week</b>  |  <b>Percent</b> | <b>Activity</b> %}
{% assessment 1 | Week 8 | 25% | Solar Tracker Report %}
{% assessment 2 | Finals Week | 30% | Final Project Report %}

{% pad 10 %}

We will use the final exam slot to share and celebrate the results of our final projects.

{% assessment 1 | Finals Week | 10% | Final Presentation %}

## Class Atmosphere

I want many things for students in my classes, and I very much want you to help me achieve these goals. 

* I want our laboratory to be a relaxed environment where you are **comfortable trying new things** and (sometimes) failing. By "failure" I do not mean "receiving an F," but I do mean that you try things, make mistakes, and learn from them. The last bit---learning from our mistakes---is the critical part. Neither I, nor you, nor your classmates should put down or belittle a classmate for trying.

* I want you to **look forward to {{site.short}} because it is fun**. We should be comfortable with each other---humor and laughter makes the day go faster and better. That said...

* We should **work hard, and be proud of that effort**. For me, a "fun" day is one where I've worked hard and improved myself. I have done my best to design a course that will be fun because it challenges us to work hard and do new and interesting things.

* **Respect matters**. Respect for each-other, regardless of where we are from and where we are on our life journey is of utmost importance. I have a great deal of respect for your effort as a student; I show that respect by challenging you to extend your limits, and supporting you to the best of my ability as you take risks and engage with the course throughout the semester. 

## Catalogue Description

A study of electronics based on the analysis, function, and operation of selected discrete and integrated solid-state devices. Topics may include solid-state power supplies, discrete control devices, and linear and digital solid-state circuits.

## Statement Regarding Disability

Berea College will provide reasonable accommodations for all persons with disabilities so that learning experiences are accessible. If you experience physical or academic barriers based on disability, please see Lisa Ladanyi (Disability & Accessibility Services, 110 Lincoln Hall, 859-985-3327, lisa.ladanyi@berea.edu) to discuss options. Students must provide their instructor(s) with an accommodation letter before any accommodations can be provided. Accommodations cannot be provided retroactively. Please meet with your instructor(s) in a confidential environment to discuss arrangements for these accommodations.
