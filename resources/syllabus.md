## Course Goals  [{% icon sign-in %}](syllabus/course-goals.html)
If this was the *only* course in electricity and electronics you take at Berea College, and you never touch or study the subject again while you are a student, what questions do I hope you will be able to answer 10 years from now?

1. **How can I be safe in everything I do?** <br/>

1. **How can I design electrical systems to sense and interact with the world?** <br/>

1. **How do I build and program those systems?** <br/>

1. **How do I communicate, with clarity, the results of my efforts?** <br/>


## Course Learning Objectives

<!-- http://teachingcommons.depaul.edu/Course_Design/developing_a_course/goals.html -->

<!-- http://www.cmu.edu/teaching/designteach/design/learningobjectives-samples/index.html -->
<!-- http://www.cmu.edu/teaching/designteach/design/learningobjectives.html -->

Learning objectives involve the kinds of knowledge you will gain regarding electricity and electronics, the ability to apply and integrate it, as well as the human connections and opportunities for lifelong learning in the field. As the course progresses, we will work together to develop answers to the following questions.

1. **MAKER**: What tools do I need to use to take part in the global electronics maker community?

1. **THEORY**: What are the connections between the theories of electricity and electronics to our daily lives?

1. **READ**: How do I interpret the many representations of electronics, and use that information to build circuits that work?

1. **DESIGN**: What knowledge of electronic components do I need to design circuits to sense and automate the world around me?

1. **LEARN**: How can I prepare myself to program systems that sense and automate the world around me, even if I've never programmed a computer before?

1. **QUESTION**: What questions can I ask about myself and the world around me, now and in the future, that sensing and automation systems can help me answer?

## Course Policies [{% icon sign-in %}](syllabus/course-policies.html)

I have some policies that I use as a foundation for all of my courses. We discuss these, and then develop any additional policies together.

## Office Hours

I am more than happy to chat, and sometimes you can stop by during office hours and I'll be free; however, I schedule my time pretty tightly, so it is possible I may ask you to make an appointment and/or follow up via email.



## Required Convocations

Required convocations will be announced as they arise.

## Course Prerequisites

MATH 012.


<br/>

<strong>When you miss class, you adversely affect your teammates' performance in the course</strong>. After **two unexcused absence**, I reserve the right to deduct 5% per absence from your final grade. 

#### Reasons You Might Be Absent

* If you have flu-like symptoms, email us and visit the health center. The Center for Disease Control recommends you stay home for at least 24 hours after the symptoms pass---RESTING. Without evidence from the health center of your visit, you are not excused.

* If you arrive particularly late, leave particularly early, or fail to participate in class, we will consider you absent.

If you miss class, you are responsible for coordinating with your team on what you missed. Missing class, excused or otherwise, does not relieve you of the responsibilities you have to do your work; it just means your absence will not be penalized.

## Technology Policies 

Much of the work in this course will require use of the computer, so these policies are designed to help you better understand how to be effective in a technology-rich environment. 

* **Laptop and Software**: We will regularly make use of laptops during class, and you are expected to have them unless explicitly stated otherwise.

* **Communication**: The course website is your primary source for information about {{site.short}}; Messages about the course will often be sent by email. These are all mechanisms you would likely use in a professional position in the real world (corporate websites, internal content management systems, and email)---you are, likewise, expected to use them in a responsible and professional manner in this course.

* **Backups**: All students are expected to back-up their work on a daily basis, which includes laboratories, assignments, and quizzes. The best way to do this is to store a copy of all work in a cloud service such as Dropbox, SkyDrive, Google Drive, or to use a DVD, flash drive, or some other media. Storing multiple copies of something on your laptop is not a backup. I will not be sympathetic to lost work in any way, shape, or form.

* **Exceptions**: Exceptions to any of these technology policies will be considered on an individual case-by-case basis but will only be granted under extreme circumstances. 

## Class Atmosphere

I want many things for students in my classes, and I very much want you to help me achieve these goals. 

* I want our laboratory to be a relaxed environment where you are **comfortable trying new things** and (sometimes) failing. By "failure" I do not mean "receiving an F," but I do mean that you try things, make mistakes, and learn from them. The last bit---learning from our mistakes---is the critical part. Neither I, nor you, nor your classmates should put down or belittle a classmate for trying.
* I want you to **look forward to {{site.short}} because it is fun**. We should be comfortable with each other---humor and laughter makes the day go faster and better. That said...
* We should **work hard, and be proud of that effort**. For me, a "fun" day is one where I've worked hard and improved myself. I have done my best to design a course that will be fun because it challenges us to work hard and do new and interesting things.
* **Respect matters**. Respect for each-other, regardless of where we are from and where we are on our life journey is of utmost importance. I have a great deal of respect for your effort as a student; I show that respect by challenging you to extend your limits, and supporting you to the best of my ability as you take risks and engage with the course throughout the semester. 

In years past, I used Chickering and Gamson's [Seven Principles of Good Undergraduate Education]({{site.media}}/seven-principles.pdf) {{site.pdf}} as my guide; in many ways, they still apply. However, as Bereans, we are all committed to the eight [Great Commitments]({{site.media}}/berea-college-great-commitments.pdf) {{site.pdf}}; I ask that we aspire to those as we challenge and learn with each other in this course.

## Catalogue Description

A study of electronics based on the analysis, function, and operation of selected discrete and integrated solid-state devices. Topics may include solid-state power supplies, discrete control devices, and linear and digital solid-state circuits.

## Evening Lab / Support

The Computing and Digital Crafts Lab is open Sunday through Thursday from 7:00 to 9:00 PM (except on evenings of convocations). The primary teaching assistant and several other TAs will be able to answer questions about the content in the course during consultations in their  Lab hours. You are strongly encouraged to make use of the help available in the Computing and Digital Crafts Lab, as well as in the instructors' office hours. Best results are obtained trying to solve problems before asking for help, and you should be prepared to show what you have already tried. Topics in this course build throughout the course, so you should be sure to do your best to keep up with the class, so as to not fall behind. No question to which you do not know the answer is "dumb" unless it goes unanswered because it remained unasked. 

## Statement Regarding Disability

Berea College will provide reasonable accommodations for all persons with disabilities so that learning experiences are accessible. If you experience physical or academic barriers based on disability, please see Lisa Ladanyi (Disability & Accessibility Services, 110 Lincoln Hall, 859-985-3327, lisa.ladanyi@berea.edu) to discuss options. Students must provide their instructor(s) with an accommodation letter before any accommodations can be provided. Accommodations cannot be provided retroactively. Please meet with your instructor(s) in a confidential environment to discuss arrangements for these accommodations.

This syllabus is a living document. It may change.
<p style="margin-top:15px;" />
Because I respect you, we will probably discuss possible changes together. But please, do not confuse my course with a democracy: I am in charge here.
