If this was the *only* course in electricity and electronics you take at Berea College, and you never touch or study the subject again while you are a student, what do we hope you will remember 10 years from now?

1. **We want to be safe in everything we do**. <br/>
  
  People who do not respect electricity are dangerous to themselves and others. Safety is the most important thing you can learn in *Craft of Electronics*.
  
1. **We want to build things**. <br/>
  
  We will learn to think with our hands as we build electrical systems; if you can hold a pencil, you can build electronics. [ details ]

1. **We want to design solutions to our own problems**. <br/>
  
  We study electricity and electronics because it enables us to better understand ourselves and our environment---and control that environment as well. [ details ]

1. **We want to communicate our efforts with excellence.** <br/>

  We design, we build, and we **share**. That communication, be it via text, live presentation, or video, must be clearly articulated and professional in nature. [ details ]

Throughout the course, we will highlight when we are learning about **safety**, focusing on **building**, or **designing** circuits and systems.
