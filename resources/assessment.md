## Assessment


### Grading Scale

The [Berea College grading scale](http://www.berea.edu/cataloghandbook/academics/aps/grades/gradingscale.asp) makes clear that:

* An **A** represents **excellent** work,
* A **B** represents **good** work, and
* A **C** represents **competent** work.

More specifically:

* An **A** is in the range of 91% to 100%
* A **B** is in the range of 81% to 90%
* A **C** is in the range of 71% to 80%
* A **D** is in the range of 61% to 70%
* An **F** is a grade of 60% or lower.

A **plus** may be earned through exceptional attendance, teamwork, professionalism and collegiality, and participation. A **plus** is completely at the discretion of the instructor.

**Any questions regarding grades should never be directed at TAs, but instead always directed to the instructor of the course.**

### Regarding Plagiarism

Plagiarism is the use of anyone else's work or ideas without adequate citation. It is a crime which is both easy to commit and easy to avoid. Ideas taken from other people include those from published or unpublished books, articles, websites, TAs, or friends' homework. The best way to avoid plagiarism is to cite ALL your sources, including those from which you paraphrase or borrow ideas, and to be sure use quotation marks when quoting verbatim. If you are not sure whether or not to cite a source, you should cite it! Simply put, plagiarism is stealing because it constitutes theft of someone else's ideas. It is a serious offense, and Berea College takes it very seriously. Plagiarism will not be tolerated! At the first offense, the student will receive an F for that assignment. At the second offense, the student will fail the course. In addition, ALL offenses of plagiarism will be reported to the Associate Provost for Academic Services as detailed in the Berea College Student Handbook.
